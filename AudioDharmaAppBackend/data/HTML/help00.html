Audio Dharma talks are organized by albums. Each album displays the number of talks and duration.

To access all talk menu items, use your finger and <strong>swipe</strong> the talk from right to left:

This brings up a menu of options for that talk:

You can now add notes, mark the talk as a favorite, share, download and see similar talks.

To rejoin the last talk, select the Replay button at the center bottom of the app.  This plays the talk beginning at the point you previously left it.
