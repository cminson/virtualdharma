The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we're beginning there. So hello and welcome to happy hour wherever you're
joining from whatever time zone. I see some folks it's morning or afternoon for
them in Japan I see you hi and and others on the east coast 9 p.m. 6 p.m. here in
California etc. and everywhere in the middle too. So welcome, welcome, welcome, warm
welcome. So for today's practice I wanted to invite us to turn our attention to
the Brahma Vihara of of joy of Mudita vicarious joy or just joy turning to joy
to gladness to happiness and this practice of turning to gladness happiness
is so happy making can be so happy making the Dalai Lama has said that if
you're just happy for your own happiness you have one chance of being happy
you're happy for other people's happiness your odds and increase to what
seven billion are we at eight billion no I don't know what the it keeps going up
every time I hear this just takes up the number of people on this beautiful
earth so so happiness gladness turning our heart to gladness whether it's ours
or others glad and our gladness and gladness of others and letting our heart
rest rest enjoy to be nourished to be nourished in gladness in its own
own good fortune and our own good fortune that we often take for granted we
often the mind turns to challenges and difficulties and what's hard instead of
realizing that there's so many things that are going okay so many things that
are going okay so so with that what I'd like to invite us tonight in this
practice is as we engage with other people's happiness to engage with
gladness for them and of course the near enemy which is envy could arise and
that's okay you're not a bad meditator you're not a bad person if any of that
arises we'll work with that and also when we turn to our own gladness to our own
happiness it can be expressed as gratitude when we're happy for our own
happiness happy for our own happiness it becomes gratitude it feels like
gratitude so so these are some invitations and of course we'll fill it
fill in all the details of practically not just talking about a blah blah blah
there's only so much that talking can do with these topics but actually feeling
into them and experiencing them firsthand for ourselves so so with that yeah
I think that's all I want to say to set the the frame just gonna turn towards
joy tonight yay happy hour turning to joy why not let's turn to joy oh I guess
that there's only one last thing I want to say you know to frame the topic and
that is if if what's coming up in your heart and your mind is like oh I've had
a hard day I'm not in the mood for joy I am just having a really hard time it's
okay it's okay joy is not forced joy is nurtured when we gently gently turn the
mind to what is good even if you're having a hard day a difficult time in
your body and your mind turning just inviting gently like like a little kitty
that's under the bed kitty kitty kitty kitty just inviting it shy kitty turning
to what is good is there something that's going okay well I have a roof over my
head yay yay hmm I had I had an orishing meal yay so just gently gently don't
have to go whole hog all the way to yay joy if that doesn't feel appropriate and
yet and yet in praise of joy in praise of joy the more joy you can contain the
more space there is for suffering to be with suffering with resilience for
yourself and for others so turning to joy is not this selfish thing of oh I'm
turning away from suffering oh I'm just gonna lie la di da la di da pollyanna
that's not the idea that's not the idea the more joy we can contain the more
resilience the more resilience there can be in our hearts our bodies or minds to
be with adversity, without falling into it, without drowning in it, for it to be balanced
with goodness, for service, for the benefit of ourselves and others.
So it's for ourselves, others, and the world.
All right.
I think I'm now done with the frame I wanted to set.
Okay, let's begin the meditation before I add more frames.
Just kidding.
All right.
Let's land.
Let's arrive together.
Let's arrive.
Let's arrive in our bodies.
As always, we start.
We start by landing, landing in this body, this moment, tilling the soil before we
turn to any gratitude or vicarious joy, just arrive with the breath, with the body.
Just arrive here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, maybe letting the word here be dropped in for you in your own pace next
two minutes.
Just arrive here.
I am here.
Letting your body be here, sensing, sensing, the sensations of the feet, the hands, your
bottom, the cushion or the chair, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
As if you're letting a birdie fly, and then here, oh, this precious body, here.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, simply here, the body with the breath.
Amazing to be here, present, and feel more expensive, more expensive, being here, just here.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently, kindly release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Now, as we continue to feel our bodies being here, here, here, connected, rooted to the earth, our feet,
our bottom on the cushion, our hands, entire body, here, notice if there is a sense of nourishing, calming, healing, soothing.
Simply sitting in silence with the breath.
Gives rise to, brings to the heart, to the mind.
Deliciously here.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Here, your thoughts are rising, gently release them.
Now, opening up, opening up your heart, your awareness further, to any goodness in the body, with the breath,
any area of the body that just feels comfortable, maybe warm, maybe soothed, letting that in, opening up to it.
Opening in what's good, what's calming, soothing, peaceful, peaceful.
Maybe you notice the breath, oh, it's moving, pretty smoothly on its own.
Or then my hands feel warm, or they feel nice and cool, my cheeks, maybe my feet feel relaxed and heavy, my legs.
Shading any parts of the body, whether there is ease.
Now, opening up a little wider, opening the heart a little wider to this ease, to this goodness.
Ah, drinking it in, let it nourish you, doesn't have to be huge.
However it's showing up, however shyly it's showing up, welcome it, open the door, let it in fully.
Now, opening wider, as you stay in body, what is good?
What else is good in this moment?
Maybe the temperature where you're sitting in your room is comfortable, you have a roof over your head dwelling.
Appreciate, appreciating the goodness of this, this gift is blessing, glad for your own good fortune, this person who is me.
Maybe feelings of care, love for supportive friends and family, or odds.
Hmm, happy, glad for the good fortune of this person who is me.
Stay embodied, don't get into your head to think about these, just let them arise in the body and resonate and be appreciated.
Thank you.
Opening up to the good in your life, the gladness that brings up.
Maybe even joy, ever so shyly.
Keep breathing, keep being embodied.
Stay, stay with goodness, with appreciation, with what is good.
Challenges, sorrows, fear arises, say thank you, not now.
I'm inviting joy, inviting gladness right now, for the benefit of myself and all beings.
Simply release, you know you can.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now if you wish, bring to mind someone who is dear for you, someone for whom it's easy to feel warmth, care, metta.
When consider something that's going well in their life, may not be everything, they might have challenges and difficulties, that's okay.
But is there one area, one blessing in their life that is good?
Let your heart open to being happy, being glad, celebrating this good fortune, this blessing, this near being has.
Breathing, feeling embodied, maybe adding phrases, I am happy, I am happy for your happiness.
May this blessing of yours, may it continue, may it increase.
May it never end.
What is giving you gladness and happiness, made increase, I share in your happiness as if it were mine, it is mine.
Imagining them really appreciating this blessing and you being glad with them, for them, vicarious joy can feel bright in our heart.
If at any point envy arises, it's okay, you're not a bad meditator or bad person.
Simply turning, turning to the hurt of one thing, one thing is yourself and holding it with metta, with care, it's okay sweetie, it's okay.
And see if care for yourself, metta for yourself can coexist, it's impossible for it to coexist with gladness for the good fortune of another.
If not, then just attend to your own heart, with love and care and goodness.
Maybe you can be happy for them and hold yourself with tenderness, I want for wanting this in your life, this blessing.
Could it be at both ends?
Maybe you discover your heart is more generous than you realized.
You can stay with this dear being if you wish, their blessing or blessings or invite someone else, another being into your heart, heart space, bring their blessing to mind and feel happy for them.
As if it were your own happiness, your own joy.
See what's needed right now.
See what's needed right now.
Maybe for the last few minutes if it feels appropriate for you.
Including yourself together with these other beings, opening up feeling blessings in all your lives.
May our happiness, may all our happiness, our blessings, may they continue, may they increase, may they never waive.
Simply, I'm glad, I'm happy, I celebrate, I delight in this goodness, in our goodness, in our gladness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate, I celebrate all the goodness, all the blessings in my life with an open heart, with joy.
May all beings everywhere, know joy, know the goodness of their blessings.
May all beings everywhere be happy and free.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
We have a few minutes for reflections, questions, comments for whatever you might have observed, what came up for you.
In the spirit of service, in the spirit of service to the Sangha, like wow, this was an aha moment or this was a challenge, it's all okay, so you are invited.
You can also type in chat if you like, and if you typed in me alone, privately I won't read your name, only the share, and if it's public to everyone I will read your name, and I see Richard's hand that has been raised.
Yes, Rich.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I just wondered if it's okay to experience sympathetic joy watching YouTube videos of little babies and puppies.
Of course it is.
You can see the hearts and the thumbs up that are being shared in the Zoom spade. Looks like other people are joining in.
Yes, sure. Of course, absolutely.
Even though it's not serious.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Joy is joy.
Yes, and cats and dogs too.
Cats and dogs too. Absolutely.
The spirit of vicarious joy, happiness for other people's blessings, for other being's blessings. Oh, it gives you joy. It's when little children are being happy, little children are well taken care of or they're sweet.
It just brings up joy.
Yeah, yeah.
And I appreciate also the comments that are coming in, both privately and also publicly and on YouTube.
And as we started at the beginning of our acknowledging Take Not Hans passing today, what a beautiful, amazing, precious, precious gift, ties, teachings and presence in this world has been to so many.
And he also taught so much about peace, about joy, about gladness, such tenderness, such gentleness in his teaching.
So bringing him in again, both at the beginning and now. So Claire, I see your hand, please.
Thank you. I loved your topic tonight. It happens to be very appropriate because I don't want a beautiful day, but in any event, I wanted to share a practice that I've had for a number of years, because others might find it helpful.
I have two friends in different parts of the world, once in Switzerland and once different part of the US. And we exchange every day, gratitude list via email of three things that we're grateful for every day.
And it's really just been such a rewarding experience for me and I think for the other two women also.
It's really changed our lives.
Wow, beautiful. Yeah, thanks for sharing that Claire. Remember, you had mentioned it before once and and I think what we tried actually that evening was to have folks connect together.
If they wanted in the, in the room, I forgot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah in the room. So maybe we'll do that again now that you brought it up again and see if people would want to do that. And I wonder if anyone did actually last time.
If you did, would you raise your hand or, or, or type in chat if if you did connect. Yes. Okay, I see Fred. Yeah.
Yep, you're on muted Fred.
Oh, okay. Well, I just raised my hand because because I did do it.
Yeah, great. And with two other folks in the, in the song. And we've been doing it nightly since whenever that was, what a month, two months maybe. Yeah.
And it's, and it's been a great thing to do.
So thank you Claire. Oh, beautiful. Lovely. Thank you for sharing Fred. It's great that you've been doing it the entire month with a couple of other people from happy hour. It's lovely. Yeah, beautiful.
I see other reflections. I think, oh, earlier hadn't seen Charlie's Hello. Charlie, thank you for the hello. Yes. And let's see, moving up and down. Yes. That the, the next Buddha will be the Sangha, maybe us maybe so.
Now says sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy. Bye. Oh, great. Thank you now for bringing this, this quote from take not Han as a way for us to honor him tonight with the topic that we have.
Beautiful. Thank you. Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.
Beautiful. Take not Han. Lovely.
I mean says I felt joy to see that people worldwide are pausing in their day to reflect on take not Hans life and to pay tribute to him. What an amazing influence. Yes, I agree.
How, how inspiring really how inspiring that one human being at this gift of this human being this simplicity simple simple way of being in the world, you know, in some ways he was a quote unquote simple monk as the Dalai Lama often says and what an impact what an impact that he had.
And let's see seems like there is also Memorial Wayne shared this information I'll read it out loud for those who are joining on YouTube.
We invite you to join our global community online as we commemorate ties life and legacy with five days of practice and ceremonies broadcast live from Hugh Vietnam and plot plum village France starting on Saturday, January 22. Please see our website for more.

I'm so appreciating that I'm so touched by the wealth of, of so much such beautiful sharing tonight on the chat. That's beautiful.
Yeah, and Nancy also shares a 7pm tonight as well apparently there's program on plum village. Oh, the plum. Dave says the plum village website may have crashed it's presently unavailable. Wow. Maybe they were not expecting so many people from around the world.
So, so dear ones. So, you know, tell you what, this is what we can.
Let's honor. Let's take our, let's take opportunity tonight to honor tie in our small groups with the theme of joy. How has knowing him, one of his teaching something about him inspired you how has it supported you.
Maybe something comes up for you. Maybe just the fact that he's been a human being in the world or maybe you read a book of his or one of these instructions that have stayed with you.
So that is the invitation. That is the invitation for tonight's breakout rooms. And, and if you can stay please stay I think it's so lovely to take this opportunity to honor tie in this way together as a community in small groups so I'm creating the rooms now.
And, and yeah, please, please take care. Here we go. I'm going to open the room to take care of yourselves take care of each other and we'll come back with more time for reflections. Okay, here we go.
Okay, the rooms are closed everyone is back welcome back. We have a couple of minutes if any reflections anything came up you like to share can raise your hand.
As I wait for you to raise your hand or read this reflection from Sharon on YouTube that ties meditation instructions on in breath I am arriving on out breath I am home or an anchor for me how beautiful, how beautiful.
Yeah, such beautiful instructions. Actually years ago he was giving a teaching in Oakland and I had the privilege to, to be in his presence. What an amazing being. Yeah.
Ah, I actually found out only through you guys tonight I've been sequestered working all afternoon so I didn't hear the news until you shared it through chat so we get to we get to honor him together.
Any reflections please we have a minute. Any thoughts that came up your small group discussion.
Fred, please.
I'm going to say this because I think it runs so counter to everything tonight. But I, as I was saying in the, in small group. Maybe it was this time in Oakland that you were at Nikki. I remember it as being in Berkeley, but I went with some friends to hear him.
It really was it was, you know, 25 30 years ago. And I just wasn't ready. You know that I know people were bold over my friends were my wife was, and I thought well there's something there but I just wasn't ready for it.
And, you know, rightness is all.
I just want to say that. Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing that friend. Thank you. Yeah.
That beautiful. Yeah, there is there is readiness whenever one is ready whenever there is a time then the teacher shows up. Yeah, thanks so much for sharing that. And I see your hand.
Very quick, because Fred said this. I had a very similar experience friend, which was that I was 19 and I went to see him at spirit rock and I wasn't ready. And I thought it was a little strange there was all this singing and my friend and I snuck off into the woods and like, because we weren't
supposed to talk we snuck off into the woods so we could talk.
You know, I got it and you know, I think the seeds got planted somehow. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, it's sweet. I'm so appreciating these stories and actually the the
I love to say I like your courage. Right. Yeah. And also, I'll share with you that the time it wasn't 25 three years ago. Maybe I saw him maybe 1015 years ago in Oakland. It was another very large teaching. And he was older at that point and slower and
in some way, you know, I really appreciate what he was talking about. And yet, there was a lot of pomp and circumstance that did the evening went on and on and on and on. So that that I'll share that too. And I've loved reading his books.
Just the simplicity. Being a piece has been a go to for me. Just each page is so simple. It's just so lovely. So, alright, I see more hands raised but with 702. So let's bring this formally to close so that people want to leave but I'll stay a few
couple of minutes extra if people want to stay and say and I mark I see you answer your hand I'll stay extra and invite others to do the same. So, so thank you all thank you for showing up for practicing supporting yourselves, each other and this
cultivation for all beings everywhere. May all beings be well. May all beings be free. And God day, God day, Parasam, God day, take not hot. Thank you all.
