I will be using occasional single bells during the following meditation.
The meditation will end with three consecutive bells.
Sit in a comfortable and alert posture and gently close your eyes.
Take a few deep breaths and with each exhale, settle into your body, relaxing any obvious tension or holding.
Relax with your legs.
Relax.
<p>
Now let the breath return to normal.
And bring your attention to wherever the sensations of breathing are easiest to notice.
And allow your attention to rest there.
Relax.
Relax.
Now shift your attention to listening to sounds.
<p>
To any sounds that arise, the sound of my voice, the sounds in the room, the sounds outside.
Body sounds, any sounds that arise.
Keep your attention on sounds. Let them come to you.
No need to look for them or chase them.
Stay soft, relaxed, receptive, not looking for anything, simply being open to any sounds that appear.
Relax.
<p>
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
<p>
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.

Let the mind become like a big sky a big empty space
Different sounds appearing
Changing and vanishing in the open space of the mind
You

<p>
You
The mind is like an open space
Sounds appearing and disappearing in this open emptiness of mind

Keeping the same spacious receptive attitude
Bring the attention back to the breath
For this last two minutes, see if you can stay connected with every breath
<p>
Notice the entire length of each breath
Stay connected with the gaps between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
<p>
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
<p>
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
The silence between the breaths
