Good evening.
Nice to be here.
I'm thinking I need to think of something a little more creative to say, but it is nice to be here.
So we'll begin with a guided meditation.
I'm just allowing yourself to arrive.
Arrive.
<p>
Arrive to this moment.
Arrive.
Arrive.
Settling in.
Perhaps getting connected to the body.
Feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body.
<p>
Feeling the feet on the ground.
Bringing a sense of presence, a sense of aliveness to the experience of this moment.
Bringing awareness, a sense of being embodied.
Perhaps it's been a day with a lot of thinking.
Now's the time to let the thinking relax.
We can bring some awareness to just the simple sensations of sitting.
<p>
To sit and know you're sitting.
To sit and know you're sitting.
To sit and know you're sitting.
To sit and know you're sitting.
Maybe intentionally bringing some attention to those areas that feel tight, contracted, tense.
It might be that with some simple attention, those areas can soften, release, relax.
<p>
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
And of course, we might notice that the body is breathing.
It can be nice to rest the attention on the sensations of breathing, the feeling of the chest moving, the abdomen moving.
<p>
Maybe the feeling of air going in and out of the nose.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
<p>
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
Maybe not too.
<p>
And it can be helpful to check in with the body and see if there's any pleasant experience, sensations.
Maybe a sense of being settled a little bit more than you were before you sat down to meditate.
Maybe a little bit more ease, maybe a lot more ease.
Maybe there's a sense of openness, spaciousness.
Maybe this is just a small portion of your experience.
Maybe it's your dominant experience, predominant experience.
<p>
A tiny corner of your experience or the central theme.
Can you bring your attention to that experience of ease, maybe the more quiet, spaciousness, well-being? And allow that experience to get as big as it would like.
We're not forcing it, we're not making it happen, we're just allowing.
Maybe it expands like a bubble, bubble gum bubble.
This feeling might not be there, that's okay.
But if it is, can you use that as a support for your mindfulness? That is that the mindfulness is born out of a sense of quiet, spaciousness, ease.
<p>
To whatever degree, to whatever degree, maybe it's not completely quiet, not completely spacious, but a little bit more.
Allow this sensation, this experience to be a support.
