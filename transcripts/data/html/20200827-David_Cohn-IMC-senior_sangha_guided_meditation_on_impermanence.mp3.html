Shall we meditate then for a little while?
So if you could assume an alert
posture with your spine loosely straight,
and gently close your eyes,
and relax,
stay in a relaxed mind,
<p>
and gently be aware of your body,
and hook from your thinking mind
that all worries and concerns that you may have,
let them go.
Just for now, let them go and come into your heart,
come into your body,
<p>
relax your shoulders,
relax your heart,
and all the emotions that are around the heart,
and relax the breathing.
Maybe taking a breath, deep breath in,
and on the exhale, just relax completely.
<p>
And you might notice something about
change that's happening in your body,
relaxing the arms and the hands,
and noticing pulsations in the hands,
in the palms,
noticing the breath constantly
<p>
rising and falling.
This body is in constant change.
This body is in constant change.
Changing of hearing.
Let's listen to this bell.
The vibrations of the bell keep changing,
<p>
and the center one keeps changing.
Stay in a relaxed mind,
and gently being aware of this body.
Pulsations,
movements,
even light changes behind your eyes.
<p>
We think that we're present for this second, perhaps.
But this second
has become the last second,
and the future second keeps coming.
So where is this second
dissolving into the past,
<p>
entering into the future constantly in flux?
There's not even a microsecond.
Because there was a microsecond that this microsecond disappears into,
and a microsecond
that is beckoning for it to come.
Scientists have discovered what they call an ATTA second,
<p>
one billionth of a second.
There's no real present moment.
Just change.
If there was a book of 3,000 pages,
and we hammered a sharp needle
through all the 3,000 pages,
<p>
when would that needle reach
the 81st page?
It's immediately in page 82,
83, 84, 85.
It's said
that you can't cross the same river
<p>
twice
because the river keeps changing.
The river of our living
experience keeps changing.
The river of our living
experience keeps changing.
<p>
Seeing impermanence, the mind does not cling.
When the mind does not cling,
the mind is not agitated.
When the mind is not agitated, it achieves nirvana.
Maybe not nirvana,
but maybe the vicinity of nirvana.
<p>
Up nirvana.
Is there some well-being here?
Some okanus.
If there is, connect with that well-being.
This isn't a physical feeling
or even an emotional feeling.
<p>
It's deeper than that.
Letting go of clinging,
being with impermanence,
being with awareness.
This place of non-clinging is our home.
It's happiness.
<p>
It's our birthright.
No purpose.
No gain, no loss,
no success, no failure,
no grasping, no fearing,
just aware
<p>
of change.
Continue to relax
and allow this.
Thoughts come.
That's what our brain does.
It thinks.
<p>
Suzuki Roshi said,
door open for thoughts to enter
and the back door open
for thoughts to leave.
Just don't serve them tea.
Spacious mind,
<p>
relaxed mind,
impermanence happening
constantly.
It's happening constantly.
It's happening constantly.
Okay.
<p>
You can open your eyes whenever you're ready.
