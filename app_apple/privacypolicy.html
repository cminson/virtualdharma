    <h1>Audio Dharma:  Privacy Policy</h1>

<h4>
Audio Dharma believes in strict user privacy.  To honor that, the app does not require user login. Nor does it collect user personal information in any other fashion.  Users are therefore strictly anonymous. No personal records are kept. 
<p>
Three pieces of anonymous device data are collected:   1) what talk has been played or shared and 2) the IP address of the device that played or shared the talk 3) the device ID itself.  This information is stored in an Amazon datacenter. It is retained indefinitely, encrypted and protected behind firewalls. There is no way to tie this information to a specific user, given (as stated above) no personal user information is requested or retained in the first place.
<p>
If any of your personal information is provided to us by other means (as in through a bug report) we will never retain this information. Nor will we ever give it to a 3rd party.  The one and only exception to this policy is if we receive a lawful subpoena to produce this information. In that case we will honor the subpoena, but we will first offer you a reasonable chance to challenge the subpoena if allowed by law.
