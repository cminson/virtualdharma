So, formally hello and welcome to Happy Hour. 
Lovely to see you, to be with you, dear fellow practitioners. 
So, for the theme for today, the theme is inspired by a conversation I had with a practitioner who was talking about who was having a practice discussion and about how they wake up sometimes in the middle of the night with, and they have insomnia and pain. 
And this is part of the human condition. 
Anyone, anyone has ever, anyone of you has never, I can't speak tonight. 
The question I'm trying to get out is to feel into your own experience and remember the times that you have woken up in the middle of the night with insomnia or with pain. 
Anyone not, anyone who's not had that experience in their lives? Yeah, it's, it's, we all have that experience of waking up with pain with insomnia or, or if not in the middle of the night, we have a body, we have a human body, all of us experience pain. 
At some point, it's a part of being human. 
It's, it's a mark of existence having a body that experience illness, it experiences pain, it experiences aging, etc. 
It's a mark of existence. 
So, so knowing that these are parts of being human, it's not a mistake. 
It's not that you have done something wrong and you're being punished or you're bad, it's just part of life. 
These things happen, insomnia happens, illness happens, because we are human beings, things arise, causes and conditions, so many of them out of our control, some within our control, but so many of them out of our control, so many of them out of control, out of our control. 
So, so how do we work? How can we work compassionately and with metta with these causes and conditions? So, so keep this meditation, this teaching in your back pocket the next time you wake up in the middle of the night, perhaps with pain or with insomnia. 
So, so the first invitation, the first invitation is how we approach the perspective we take with what is arising. 
Do we self-flagellate? Do we apply what's called second arrows in the Buddhist teachings? The first arrow is the pain, the first arrow is the suffering, the insomnia that has arisen because of all the causes and conditions. 
Do we then take and hit ourselves and injure ourselves with second arrows of, oh, why me? Why is this happening to me? Why, what's wrong with me? Like, it's my fault, I'm terrible, like me, bad, bad, bad, ouch, ouch, you're already hurting. 
You know, we often take daggers and just like, we start injuring ourselves even more. 
Or this is terrible, this is awful, make it go away as if by the force of will, we can make it go away. 
And guess what? It's especially sleeping and pain, the more we tighten, the more our bodies and our minds tighten around it with aversion, with wanting to push it away. 
Guess what happens? The opposite, right? They get worse, we get more wound up, both with the pain and with being awake. 
So the invitation is to recognize if there are second arrows. 
And if there are second arrows, again, don't take on third arrows, like, oh, I'm a terrible practitioner, I'm self-flagellating, I've been meditating for a while and I still, I'm hard on myself. 
Okay, please don't take third and fourth and fifth arrows, just have some humor. 
Kindness, it's okay, it's okay, it's part of the human condition, it's okay, this happens, this happens. 
And instead, instead, what if we turned it around? What if we turned it around? Let's say in the middle of the night when you're awake thinking, okay, great, here's an opportunity for practice, I could be sleeping, but now actually, I can practice in this moment, I can practice, I can calm and settle in my mind and heart and deepen because often pain, often, as you well know already, pain, suffering, sorrow are the doorways to awakening. 
They are not problems to get rid of, to push away so that now you can practice, oh, this pain is, this physical pain is bugging me if I could only be comfortable so that I could meditate, like, that's such a funny perspective, right? The pain, the suffering, this insomnia is the doorway, is the invitation. 
Hello, dear human being who is suffering, this is what suffering is like, ah, welcome to acknowledging, to opening to the human condition for yourself and all other beings, you can be sure there are other beings in that moment in time in the world who are also either having insomnia or having pain, thousands, thousands of us, given that we have, there are what, seven or almost eight billion of us or something like that now, I think the most recent count I heard, there are, there would be hundreds if not thousands of human beings in that moment who are having the same condition as you are having. 
So, same more in the guided meditation, but essentially we want to open up to the pain, to the suffering, to the insomnia, ah, hold it with, with kindness, hold it with kindness, hold it with kindness because sometimes we don't, you don't have a choice, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's already here, there's not much you can do about it, you can't push it away, so by trying to push it away it actually makes things worse. 
So, opening up, opening up and you realize actually when you stop resisting, when you stop resisting that something's, let's go, something releases, something let's go and so that's number one and number two is metta, metta, really a lot of metta, a lot of self-compassion because in fact working with challenges, it's, you know, meditation is not all about bliss and hanging out in blissful states, but it turns out that actually working with pain and sorrow and insomnia can lead to bliss states, I mean it seems counter-intuitive, how can holding, being with, challenge, lead to bliss, lead to ease, but that's exactly what happens, which is, which can seem so counter-intuitive, but that I invite you to open up, open up the way that your mind habitually treats pain, like okay make it go away, I don't like it, terrible, I just want pleasure, I just want ease, open up to the ways that you can grow in your humanity, the ways in which your humanity, your wisdom, your compassion can open up, can flourish for yourself and for others through this pathway. 
So there is so much to say, so much opportunity in this and I've already spoken plenty and I think I'd like to switch, invite us to switch to practice and maybe whatever you need to know, I'll share in the guided meditation, I think that's enough for a darnment, so I invite you to arrive in your seat, I invite you to arrive in your seat in this moment, arriving, landing as always, connecting, connecting with the breath, arriving, arriving in this moment, arriving with the breath, with the body, whatever is arising in the body letting go of thoughts, of plans, whatever has come before, not needed, taking a moment of refuge the breath connected, connecting, settling let it go, let it go, here, here, just connecting with the breath in the body, gently, ever so gently, ever so gently making space here, letting the breath be nourishing, healing, cleansing as it moves through you each breath, arriving more fully with each breath you you you imagine that in this moment you're woken up in the middle of the night with insomnia and maybe some discomfort instead of turning away, pushing it away with aversion, hating it, can you turn towards, open your heart, turn towards, let your body relax, open up, embrace this moment of being awake, being aware feeling the body and being breathed, fully embracing it, fully embracing it it is like this right now can I open my heart as if I'm opening my arms wide, wide, the way you would open your arms wide to embrace the sunset or a beautiful sky or the clouds or the ocean this moment is like this this moment of being alive, being awake is like this what gifts, what wisdom, what gifts of wisdom and compassion does this moment have for me the shifting, turning our attitude to open up to this first and foremost letting awareness, letting awareness ever so gently you're aware of the body breathing, the body nooks and crannies, maybe there's some discomfort as if you're holding, holding a little child on the baby that was hurting, in your mind's eye, holding all the parts of the body that might not be comfortable, not pushing them away but letting awareness hold them gently, lovingly you you can there be patience, can there be gentleness as the mind connects with the body, with the discomfort in the body as if cooling, as if soothing, as if singing a lullaby but any part of the body that's not comfortable, that's in pain gentle, gentle, gentle care as if you're rocking, it's a little baby that is your body good well, love, care for this body that is mine and also not mine completely, it's nature you this body doing the best it can with all the causes and conditions of this life thank you body, I care for you I hold you with ease, with care, with tenderness you you you you you you and now if you wish, imagining and inviting yourself to consider that you are not alone in whatever is arising in this moment, whether it's insomnia or physical pain, challenge considering that there are so many human beings, beings around the world who have this condition right now, or you can expand it, they've had it before or they will have it we're wishing well, opening to metta, to compassion for yourself and all the beings with this predicament, may all of us, all of us have ease in our bodies, all of us imagining, perhaps a man here in the same country, a woman in a different continent an older being on an island, it's okay to use your imagination to get a sense of the common humanity of this see if you can connect, if you can connect, at least one or two of you other human beings in your imagination their challenge, their difficulty, not so different from yours in order to open, in order to help open up the heart, the compassion, may all of us, may all of us have ease I can be supportive instead of just thinking of myself, to feel solidarity with so many humans, all of us holding our challenge, our difficulty with grace, with dignity may all of us have ease, may all of us have goodness, all you dear fellow human beings, just like me, may all of us be free, be free from this challenge, may all of us have goodness in our lives all of us held with universal compassion and love, by the Buddha, being of light, or whatever compassionate archetype works for you or perhaps all of us holding each other, with care, solidarity and mutual compassion, see what works for you you you may be going back and forth to giving compassion, may you, imagining few individuals or one individual, may you be free, may you have ease fellow human being, dear friend or may both of us have ease, may all of us have ease giving, receiving, sharing opening your heart featuring compassion and wisdom, and deepening your humanity you you you noticing how your heart can experience generosity, generosity pain not as a problem to hate, to be afraid of, but as an opportunity to open to generosity of your heart or others for yourself the last few minutes, letting your body be held, the physical body be held in this expansive care, generosity wishing, wishing sharing the generosity of your spirit, because of, through this challenge, all beings everywhere may all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves thank you everyone, thank you for your practice so, so we have few minutes, any questions, comments, any insights, reflections do you like to share for the benefit, really for the benefit of others out of wisdom, out of your care, compassion you're invited to share in chat or raise your hand if you share with me privately, I won't read your name, if you share publicly, I will read your name and reflection one private one, that was lovely thank you, you are so welcome it worked to you now, anytime in the middle of the night or any time you have pain or insomnia which I have had my fair share, my chronic illness, it's a great opportunity for practice it's a gift, gift of darkness as Mary Oliver would put it as something I'm paraphrasing a friend once gave me a box of darkness as a gift or a friend once gave me a box of darkness, it took me a while to realize that too was a gift today we realize that the gifts of darkness, boxes of darkness are two or gifts Dave, I see your hand, another private message, thank you so much for that, you are welcome so Dave, please yeah, Mary, thank you for this so much, this is exactly what I've been needing so much lately some time ago you said something I thought was just the most remarkable thing I've ever heard anyone say so brace yourself, this is going to be a little praise when you said I get to suffer, I get to suffer and you were sincerely pleased with that and what a benefit and a gift that is to the practice and I've been struggling with tinnitus and that helped immensely and the other day I said to my acupuncturist that I'm going to try to treat it in principle as the hiss of mindfulness, it's not much of a bell and she liked that and I've been working on that and it has helped a lot and I just want you to know that it's not as bad as it was, it's not as bad as it was every once in a while I get a pang of dread for what it might be in the future but the future is not here and the practice is really helping me out so thank you very much, Nikki I am so touched, deeply touched Dave as to how supportive the practice has been to you and the shifting of your perspective I am so moved, I am so moved by that knowing how challenging tinnitus can be for so many, yourself included and how you've shifted your perspective to be a hiss of mindfulness and wow, wow, how that shift in perspective has attenuated, made it softer, easier, has brought freedom and the Buddhist words really, that's what freedom is, you know, nebana, awakening and freedom seems like so holy but this is freedom, it's right here Dave you're experiencing freedom with respect to your tinnitus so thank you so much, yeah, beautiful oh and thanks Morgan for finding the poem from Mary Oliver someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness it took me years to understand that this too was a gift what a beautiful poem thank you to Mary Oliver yeah, and also I do want to thank the practitioner earlier and the practice discussion who offered what they were working with so that their practice can serve everyone and so I want to acknowledge them and thank them also for their practice as they've offered it to us as the inspiration for this, for this evening so so dear ones, let's turn into practicing together in small groups and if you can stay, please do, it's such a privilege to be able to connect just for a few minutes, six, seven minutes with fellow practitioners and if you have to go, it's okay but don't go out of fear, don't go out of other human beings, they're just, they're really nice so I'm going to create the breakout rooms and as always, take care of yourselves, take care of each other don't forget metta compassion and these fellow human beings you'll meet in the small groups are just like you, they have experienced physical pain they have experienced insomnia all of us have, all of us opening the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other, here you go.
