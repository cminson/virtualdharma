{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I saw a cartoon and it was like two people on a beach sort of in chairs looking out on the water."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And one person says to the other, I'm relaxed enough that I've stopped thinking about the drive here, but not so relaxed that I'm not thinking about the drive back."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So the topic for this morning is thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Thinking, mindlessness, mindfulness, rumination."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And I want to try to, in a sense, parse different forms of non-mindfulness that maybe not all forms of non-mindfulness are created equal."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So the patterns of thinking, they do change, I think kind of dramatically over the course of a practice life, that we come to contemplate the Dharma, to think about the Dharma a lot."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "In a sense, more and more reminds us of the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so this becomes a kind of active point of reflection, of contemplation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And there are other changes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "There are, I think, real reductions in certain species of self-related thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And it's not that all thoughts of self-reference drop out of consciousness entirely."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But there are certain kind of self-referential, ruminative thought of who we are, what we're like, where we're going, what people think, what the future looks like for me, who I will become, what I will acquire."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "This kind of movement of really taking the self as an object and pondering it, that's a very congealed mode of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But not all non-mindfulness is the same."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Not all thinking is the same."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Not all forms of autopilot are equally destructive."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We meditators, we're almost tend to be like a little embarrassed that we think, you know, that when the guided meditation kicks in, right, and we're in the middle of some wild something, you know, or we're wondering what that knocking is."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "That's fairly persistent for the wrong door."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But that moment of just like, okay, we get called back to whatever, breathing or something, and it's, you know, jarring, and there's a sense of just almost like a child being caught doing something wrong or something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And of course, thinking is not the enemy, and the mind is just another sense gate."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's just another sense gate, like hearing or feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And I remember a teacher saying, you know, you would never try to plug your ears with cotton in order to get enlightened."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We have those same fantasies."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Whatever the equivalent of plugging the ears with cotton would be for our thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Yeah? And I remember during a retreat, Michelle McDonald said, you know, if you broadcast what everyone was thinking in the hall, you know, if you just broadcast it all hundred, right? Which she said, it would break your heart, you know, it would break your heart."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We're learning about thinking and about silence."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And in a way, if we're ashamed of anything inside us, it short circuits investigation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Yeah? If it feels like we may discover something about ourselves, about our conditioning that could break us, we don't look."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Yeah? So a researcher, Kalina Kristof, brain researcher, she does a lot of very interesting things and is interested in mindfulness, meditation stuff, and among other things."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And in one one research approach, she had participants do this think aloud paradigm, you know, like 10 minutes in a room."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's kind of like, just speak out the Pappancha in your mind, the mental proliferation, just say it out loud, don't censor yourself, 10 minutes, just go, right? And then research assistants, you know, transcribed it and then coded it, you know, just sort of deciphering it into different categories and chunks."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so Kristof gave one, you know, just one line, hopefully I'll get the new job because I really want it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I haven't seen her in a long time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Yeah? So it's just that, 10 minutes, just that, right? And you got to kind of lift a glass to the research assistants there too."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "That's the no joke, that job, yeah? And they gathered all of this kind of like they're trying to parse this, what is happening in people's minds, yeah? And so it was 1300 words, yeah, on average, and 30 discrete chunks of thought, you know, where there is including 20 major transitions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So that example of I'm tired of my old job, I miss my dog, that's a major transition, yeah? 20 of those in the course of the 10 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And she was looking, as I'll get back to later, about the valence, yeah? The kind of the Vedana sort of, like positive, you know, positive, negative, neutral, yeah? And then the continuities and discontinuities."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so just seeing that is like, oh, okay, 1300 words, 30 discrete chunks of thought, 20 breaks in continuity, and that is 10 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And we kind of live in that, yeah? And a question of like, why has evolution conserved those habits so exquisitely? Is it just to like humiliate us as meditators, right? It feels like that sometimes, you know? But it's probably useful for staying alive, yeah? Like that we heard the door knocking, and there is some like sense of a little vigilance or question, what is that? We did not stay with our breath."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "You did not keep listening to me, right? All of a sudden, there was something else, yeah? And so, yeah, single-pointedness is there's a certain kind of defenselessness about it, yeah? To just sit and to relinquish the kind of vigilance and the orientation and the tracking of threat and opportunity that entails some measure of trust, some measure of safety, some measure of."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "This is part of why we take the precepts on retreat, yeah? To know that we have each other's backs, to know that we are formally committed to non-harming, yeah? So that some of the vigilance might be released, yeah? And this may allow us to settle into the moment in a deeper way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so, yeah, those habits, the habits of fragmentation, of discontinuity, of narrating our life has evolutionary value, I'm sure."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But our happiness was not at the top of evolution's to-do list, yeah? It's like, this is why some of this path is against the stream."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So, sometimes it's said that mindfulness is the only factor that you can't get enough of."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "You can sort of overdo anything else, you can overdo the effort, the energy, the compassion, the equanimity, that can put you out of balance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But one of the classical views is that there is no such thing as too much mindfulness that can never actually put us out of balance, which is an interesting thought, yeah? And I was reflecting on this and feel like, oh, yeah, I agree."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "If we're aspiring for awakening in every moment, mindfulness is vital, mindfulness is vital."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And when we're really practicing, we can sense even a short burst of unconsciousness carries a certain kind of hangover, yeah? There's like a hangover from unconsciousness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And in the context of like some deep aspiration around enlightenment or something like this, there's, you're kind of like kindling a fire, you know? And moments of unconsciousness sort of douse the glowing embers."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "You can actually start to feel it, yeah? And the kind of way that, yeah, just unconsciousness diffuses, diffuses the energy of insight, of samadhi."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "That's when we're dedicating each moment to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But if we're honest, at best, we're aspiring for enlightenment some of the time, right? Not all the time, right? Let's be honest."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "The rest of the time, I'd just like to be comfortable, you know, right? So, I want to put in a plug for mindlessness, yeah? This is not a retreat talk, by the way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "You could give on a Sunday morning or in a retreat."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "This one you do not give on a retreat."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "This is different, yeah? So, this is different."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Yeah, this is kind of like, all right, how do we be nuanced about mindlessness and, you know, this portion of the talk is sponsored by Netflix."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Just interest of full disclosure."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So, when the attention is engaged consistently, it requires effort and energy, yeah? There are times when we just develop so much momentum that it's the image Gil uses of just coast, the mindfulness is just like coasting down water with, you know, there's wind at your back, there's current at your back."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But a lot of times to attend, to move the attention to the breathing, for example, entails a measure of energy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's like attentional energy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And that has some fatiguing effects, yeah? Now, part of why we practice, part of why we practice moments of mindfulness is such that we elevate the trait level of mindfulness, the dispositional level of mindfulness, the mindfulness that we're at when we're not trying to be mindful, yeah? That changes over time, right? And so it makes it such that we don't actually have to marshal all this energy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Can I be mindful? Can I remember? Can I remember? The cruising altitude of our awareness is clearer."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But that's a whole process and I don't think it ever stops, really."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And in the meantime, it takes energy, yeah, to devote the attention to the breathing or to a book or to anything, a person to work."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And there can be a kind of backlash or a certain kind of depletion or fatigue and sometimes you see it in retreat."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "You're sort of like exerting a lot of energy and then you just hit a wall."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "How many people have done residential retreat in here? It's helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So you may be familiar with those, like the energy just sags and it just gets chaotic and very difficult to focus or to kind of feel even connected to the whole path of practice, yeah? The energy flags and maybe in our lives just we've been through something intense, yeah? And it might be some significant life event for you, something in the larger culture, COVID, all of this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It might be just a day of work or a day caring for a child or a parent or something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And there's a sense of, ah, yeah, the attention has flagged in some way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It like needs to go slack."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And we see this again after retreat sometimes, people have maybe a really rich retreat and then get home and it's like this backlash of unconsciousness, yeah? Where it's like, oh, you know, it's like the attention needs to go like fully slack, yeah? That's how it feels at least."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And we seek something that is like utterly undemanding, attentionally speaking, yeah? Like we seek the path of least resistance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We seek the activity with like zero attentional caloric burn, yeah? Like running is a thousand calories an hour and rowing or whatever, you know, like we're looking for zero."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "What is zero calories burned, attentionally speaking, in some moments, yeah? And it's worth examining like our own patterns around this, what are the low calorie attention habits, yeah? Like how do we try to soothe around that? What are the rhythms of exertion and going slack? And maybe sometimes, sometimes maybe we could say like, oh, I'm just feeling lazy or something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But other times it actually feels like, no, there's something, I don't know, I was almost going to say the word wholesome, maybe that's too much."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But it's like there's something needed to restore the attentional balance where there's a sense of needing to go slack, attentionally, to burn zero attention calories, yeah? And maybe sleep is part of this and zoning out in different ways for sure is part of that thirst that we have."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And our days are really punctuated by this rhythm of like giving attention and conserving it, of giving it and rebuilding it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And I almost thought of like, again, this parallel of exercise of like the interval training that people do."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "They'll run really fast for a little bit and then walk slowly and run really fast."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And it's worth investigating like how do we, how does our attention economy function inside? And some of our work is examining like what are, what the intervals should be, yeah? And to be careful also what we're consuming on our attentional breaks because we're pretty porous, kind of defenseless in that time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And things, you know, Thich Nhat Hanh's vision of the, the precept around non, you know, not taking intoxicants includes like entertainment or things because it sort of like gets in deeply."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And we want to be sensitive to when we've had our fill, when the attention has gone slack and there's some kind of wholesome restoration process happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But then we sort of keep going."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "There's some kind of momentum of the unconsciousness and we keep going even when we've actually like really had our fill."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Even when the attention has been kind of replenished, we can keep going in this kind of zero attentional caloric burn mode."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And that is, you can start to feel that that feels different."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "That feels different than the restoration mode."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So, so summing up where we are so far, you don't need to be engaging the attention all the time, but be careful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Be careful in the sort of doses of mindlessness, what's consumed, the intervals between engaging and releasing attention."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So this has been a kind of like, oh, yeah, I'm trying to maybe dignify certain forms of non-mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Other species of non-mindfulness are more corrosive."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "They're more problematic where we're really kind of actively marinating in the defilements."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's just like the forces of greed, hate and delusion were like actively marinating in them."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Now, maybe the traditional view would say any mindlessness is marinating in the defilements."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I don't know, but I would want to just illuminate a distinction that feels real to me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "That there are other species of being lost that are more problematic than that kind of attention just going slack."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so the wellspring of suffering, greed, hate and delusion, greed aversion, delusion, we're very familiar with what greed looks like, with what aversion or hate looks like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Delusion is more slippery, you know? And sometimes delusion itself is defined as just being lost in thought, being lost in thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "When mindfulness collapses, we truly are on a train ride and we never get to decide where we're going, our habits, good and bad, make that call."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "They're the conductor, yeah? And when we notice this, the movement from, okay, we were attending to the breathing, the movement from the breathing to being identified with thought is itself thoroughly encased in unconsciousness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's not like, okay, now maybe I'll get lost in some thoughts of dragons or whatever, right? It's just like, no, there's this collapse and this move into off the breathing and into some thought realm."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And then we live in that bubble and we are kind of severed from the Dharma, yeah? Like there is a very precipitous collapse that happens in that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And the nature of mindlessness is that it's a kind of perfect identification with the content of thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Perfect identification with the content of thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's this utter collapse of knowing, yeah? This is a philosopher, Metzinger."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "The beginning of every mind wandering episode is marked exactly by the collapse of our epistemic agent model."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Metzinger always talks like this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "The beginning of every mind wandering episode is marked by the collapse of our epistemic agent model, a conscious representation of now possessing the ability for epistemic self-control, for knowing, yeah? And the end of every episode of mind wandering is marked by the reemergence of a new epistemic agent model, the meta-aware self, the self that is then aware, the meditator that then can know lost and thought now, here."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I think it could be fruitful to analyze mind wandering as a loss of mental autonomy, goes on to say."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "When we're not identified with thought, we have a model of ourselves like an implicit model of ourselves where we can direct our attention, we can direct our thinking, we can direct the attention to the breathing or to the body more broadly or to feeling tone or to the mind, right? We can do this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We have a sense of a model of where we can exercise attentional control, yeah? And when we get lost, the epistemic, and this is the word around the knowing, the capacity for knowing, that epistemic agent, something capable of knowing, collapses very precipitously, yeah? In a sense, no one's been there to notice that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We just collapse, yeah, that model collapses and we become perfectly identified with the thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And it's literally like we become the protagonist of the thought world and we forget it's just a character, yeah? And so we do, we truly lose sense of mental autonomy and wherever that train is going, that's where we're headed, yeah? Maybe headed to heaven or hell."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We are not conducting, yeah? In those moments, we are, the Dharma feels kind of remote, yeah? The default assumptions of that mode of living, of being identified with thought, is not full of Dhamma, yeah? And the moment of coming back is the kind of, the reemergence of meta, M-E-T-A awareness, some kind of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It's the reemergence, that is a moment of mindfulness, as every teacher says, that's a moment of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And once again, we are aware of phenomena as phenomena, yeah? We're aware of the body as phenomena, the breath as phenomena, everything is phenomena, again."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But that was really deeply forgotten in that collapse of the knowing, the collapse of the epistemic agent."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "One species of this collapse that deserves note is rumination, yeah? And this brings us back to Kalina Kristoff, yeah? The rumination, the brooding, this kind of obsessional, very abstract, very deeply lost mode of thinking is not so good for us, yeah? So Kristoff writes, instead of freely moving from one topic to another, individuals prone to rumination exhibited longer negative thoughts, and negative content in ruminative individuals was linked to a narrowing in conceptual scope, yeah? Over time, suggested by higher levels of semantic similarity, so higher, like in the ruminative modes, there's less, it's this narrowing, yeah? But we can feel it when we get in those modes, it literally feels claustrophobic, yeah? The mind feels claustrophobic, it feels narrow, we're perseverating about something, we're chewing on something, and we're like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And there's more similarity, semantic similarity, encoding the words, there's more similarity, yeah? This is a very congealed sense of self, yeah? Very congealed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And in the dream of rumination, we've really almost completely forgotten the three characteristics, yeah? We've heard from Luca Nietzsche Anata that suffering, unreliability, not self."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "In our ruminations, in that state of deep loss, we fantasize about a durable pleasure that might structure our lives."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We fervently hope to tie up all the loose ends of being human and hold the world still."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We try to game out uncertainty and find the path through the labyrinth of Nietzsche of uncertainty, unreliability."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And we fantasize about taking refuge in an identity of finally finding our home in some sense of this is me, this is self."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "All of that are different kinds of dead ends, but we're so earnest in our rumination, in our loss."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And really, we're trying, I think often with rumination, we're trying to solve an affective emotional problem with thoughts, yeah? We trust thinking, we sort of like, it's the kind of main tool in our problem-solving arsenal, and we over-trust it, yeah? The word itself means chewing, yeah, and to ruminate, and it's like we're trying to digest our problem with our thought, yeah? And we're just kind of like going to chew until we feel better, but usually wind up feeling worse."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And that is because that mode of thinking maybe thoughts generally, like they do not function well as digestive enzymes, yeah? They just don't."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Maybe certain kinds of speech with one another, that can function that way, but when we're in deep in our own heads, often in this ruminative mode, things are not being digested."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And to enter that realm is to lose."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so the invitation is to go to the body, to go to the engine of feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I was alluding to this in the sit, to go to, that's like thinking is only, it's clinging necessitates thinking, yeah? I don't know that all thinking is a function of clinging, but a lot is."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And when we find ourself clinging, we, thinking becomes vital, yeah? We just feel compelled to think, to think our way to the object of our clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And so instead of taking that approach, we go to the body, to the engine, the engine of feeling and the thoughts that come off like exhaust on an engine."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "We go to the body, okay? We're willing to feel badly, yeah? Unanimity with unpleasantness doesn't feel good, yeah? There is a subtle taste of relief in it, but at least initially it does not feel good."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "But we cannot try to solve the affective, you know, challenges with the thought itself, yeah? We go to the body and we practice patience and equanimity and begin to release some of the energy of clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "It begins to take some of the thorns of our thinking, the thorns of rumination out."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "And this reconnects us to the Dharma, to what we know, to our own wisdom, to our goodness, to the path, to the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "So I offer this for consideration."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Let's just sit for a moment together."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I appreciate the opportunity to be with you this morning."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Please pick up what is useful and leave whatever is all the rest."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "Leave that behind, yeah? Yeah, okay."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Thinking, Mindlessness, Rumination", "completion": "I'll hang around for a bit if you want to chat about anything."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Is that, is that all right? Because I can't hear you on my computer, but I can hear you on here and in a small group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Is that, is that possible, Chris? I think so."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You'll just sign in again on another computer, right? I'm already signed in on mine, but when it comes to breakout rooms, can you put us in separate, is that? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You'll just be signed in again and we'll, there'll be, each, each box will be assigned to a breakout room."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So that means Yang for you, Stephen, you want to look for Stephen and Laura, not being in the same breakout group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Let me just write it down real quick here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Are there any other kind of basic questions? Nothing complicated."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Some basic questions while we're giving people another minute or two to join."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Feel free to unmute and ask if so."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So maybe I'll just take a moment actually to, once you're done sort of looking and seeing who you're here with, I just want to invite you to play with your settings a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So for me, I like to shift to speaker view when somebody is, you know, so it allows that person to be seen more fully."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then my, I'm not having to do as much processing of all the details of the other people."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it kind of helps my nervous system."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The other thing is you can hide self view if you want by clicking on the three little dots in the upper right corner of your, your picture."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Just something else to play with that can feel more natural."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Like when we're sitting with each other in person, we don't typically, we can't see ourselves in the same way as on Zoom."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And let me ask, is my volume loud enough as I'm speaking right now? Are you hearing me well enough? Great."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We still have a few people trickling in."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But I'm thinking that we probably should go ahead and get started and know that some people will, will be coming in as we go along."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So welcome to the Eightfold Path Program."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it's an honor to be here with you and Ying and Chris and Bruni were the three, the four teachers here today."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So right view is the topic that we'll be covering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There was a previous class in September that was kind of an introduction."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And if you have questions about how to find that or if you have questions about mentoring stuff or anything else, please send an email to the Eightfold Path at So we're happy to answer your questions, I think, of that nature and that environment."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So my name is Tanya Weiser."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I'll be here with you from almost, I think all but one of the classes this year."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And really looking forward to kind of hearing you, seeing you, you know, sharing the path with you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And let's see, I think, let me just ask, I was thinking about this, Chris, would you introduce yourself first because you've been with the program longest? Would you mind sharing a little bit about yourself? Sure, I'd be happy to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I'm Chris Clifford, and I've been practicing in this with IMC since about 1995."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I've been in this program for, gosh, nine years."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I just have to say that the path, the integrational power of the path is what stands out to me, that how it really, you know, I sat retreats and meditated for many years before that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But when I really got involved with the path, it started to work its way through daily life and through all the parts of my heart, my mind, my motivation, my actions, my speech, and all that got much more highlighted and integrated."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's what I really most appreciate about it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I just love that we get the chance to become what really we really appreciate and love."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And also that I find that the more honest and open I can be, the more bearable the rest of it is."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I hope you all have a wonderful experience this year."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I get a chance to talk about Right View later."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I'll save that for then."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then I thought, Ying, maybe because you're the newest to the path I might ask you to introduce yourself next."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I've been a Buddhist for a long time since 1995 and exposed early on to Mahayana tradition."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then later on, maybe for the last 15 years, mostly in Theravada tradition."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And my entry to the eight-fold path is quite gradual."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I kind of, in the Mahayana early encounters, it was through the aspect of Sila or ethical behaviors."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then over time kind of grow into different dimensions."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I also took this course about 12 years ago."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And just like you all, I had my mentor and worked through this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But more and more, I really appreciated this eight-fold path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Not only as a form of a practice, but also really a way of living."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so it's really encompassing all aspects of being human, living in a way that is kind of the noble ones, right, the noble eight-fold path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it's very uplifting and really rewarding."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I hope that you all enjoy this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I loved to be with you all for this year."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And Bruni, would you introduce yourself now, please, darling? Well, hello, everyone."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's such a joy to be with all of you and to be once again with some of the teachers and some people that I know that are here for maybe the second, the third, or the fourth time practicing the eight-fold path is being transformational."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "To engage in it, I started like Dean was saying, as all of you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And at the beginning, you know, it was kind of a learning at a conceptual level and then realized that it was much deeper than that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And going really into embodying the teachings and realizing also that it's a way of life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that is a way of really reaching peace, more peace and ease with how things are in my life and in the world."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, and I will say that one aspect that I love and that I'm looking forward to in this year too is how it is that Buddha Dharma Sangha is cultivated, you know, spiritual friends in the path and just sharing our learnings authentically and humanly."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, we're all humans."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We all have all very common, more common experiences that we think."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, we wish you a fruitful year."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "However, you engage in it and we'll see how it evolves."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Thank you for being here, Bruni, Ying and Chris."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Really, it's quite an honor to be here with you and everyone else."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, we'll start with a guided meditation, which Ying will guide us in this morning."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Whenever you're ready, Ying."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And maybe everybody should make sure you're muted."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I know there's a few people who aren't."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, maybe I just will do mute all."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Ying, and if you're muted, just unmute yourself."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think that there are a few people in the waiting room too."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Oh, I thought I turned off the wait."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Are you able to see them? Because I don't see the wait room."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Well, for some reason, I do see them, but if they're in, they may be in already."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Can you hit admit, Bruni? Yeah, I did."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Eve Foster and Kerry Pritchett."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, it could be in between when I turned it, turned the wait room off."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There may be some lingering things."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, we'll do a short guided sit to begin with for today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so, if you are able to find a sitting posture that support you, just take a few moments to move your bodies and maybe find a particular way of sitting that brings a sense of ease and settling."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Well, begin this meditation by just kind of allow our attention to settle at the lower half of our body."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Maybe feeling the body being settled on the chairs or on the floor."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And sense of support and grounding."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then at the same time, feel some sense of energetic uplifting as well through maybe a slight straightening of your torso."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Allow both the form of settling and grounding and the form of uplifting energy to be present in you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "If a long deep breath can bring a little more intimacy to here and now, I'm afraid to take a few long deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "As you return to your normal breathing and becoming aware that you're sitting, allow mindfulness to be front and center."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And have a global awareness of the fact that there is a body sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Sometimes as we just began the sitting, there can be a sense of a bubbling energy in the body."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And they feel vibrations tingling on the legs or the torso."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Maybe movements of the breath."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Simply inviting awareness to see and feel what's happening here and now."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I'm fond of the Chinese translations of this first path factor in the right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The translation of the view is a character that is the literal direct meaning of it is seeing or seeing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the first character that is being translated in Chinese can have the sense of right or wrong kind of right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It can also have the sense of being direct and so the experiential sense of the path factor, right view, is to see directly what is happening here and now."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And letting go of the stories of your experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And drop into the direct seeing, direct sensing and feeling."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Resting your attention in the body."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "If the mind wandered away."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And simply noticing the mind has wandered away."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That's enough to be back in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It can be helpful to rest awareness in the bodily sensations or the breath."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Thank you Ling Ling, to any sense."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Thank you for watching this video."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Noticing if there is any sense of ease and quietude in your experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Noticing any struggles that you may have."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Wanting your experience to be some other way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You may have wanted to get somewhere else, somewhere else, rather than here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Without having to shift and change any of this dynamics."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Simply become aware and seeing that this is happening."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I'm going to talk about right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Chris Clifford will give us a second talk on the second part of right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That will be the bigger flow of the day."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "What does view mean? There is the scene with one's eyes, philosophy, orientation, belief system, lens."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's a way of looking, the direction we're looking or the way we're looking."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I love this combination because I think about if we climb to the top of a mountain, we can look out."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "What we'll see will depend on the direction that we're facing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Assuming we're in the mountain that's close to the coast on the west coast and we look out and we're looking for the ocean but we're facing the east, we're not going to see the ocean."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we need to reorient, redirect and a lot of Dharma practice is about reorienting."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The other part of this is this idea of a perspective."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "If we can kind of see things pretty directly without a lot of filters and opinions and sort of getting closer to what we're going for in the Dharma, the sort of connection, kind of direct experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But it's also really possible to turn in the right way and to look at the ocean, but if we're wearing pink sunglasses with pink lens, it's going to alter the perspective of view, the literal seeing that happens."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Just in the same way as a particular worldview, cultural view, philosophical view, opinion will filter or alter what we're seeing when we're looking directly at our experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it becomes really important to start to recognize these filters, these perspectives, philosophies, identities, ways of sort of seeing so that we can, you know, in the practice, let them go and come more directly into alignment with a kind of a felt sense connection, a rawness of seeing things."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So another part of the path factor name is right, right, right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And let's take a minute with that word."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And just in that word, we could have all kinds of cultural views, perspectives, associations and ideas about what right means."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that can kind of get a little bit tangled up for us sometimes for some people, maybe not for all."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But I just want to sort of, it's a great example of how, you know, if you look at right view and you bring to it like, yes, I'm right in my view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That's really different than the right that's being hinted at here, which would be more like, if I need to put a screw and a piece of wood, the right tool would be not a hammer, but a screwdriver or a drill, right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So that it's like sort of that idea of also if I'm standing at the mountaintop, and I want to see the ocean, the right direction is to look in the West."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So another translation of right is something that, you know, I feel was talking about recently is beautiful, right, something, there's something quite beautiful, wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we've got this rightness that's like what is useful, what is wholesome, what is helpful for this particular situation."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then with the wrong view, kind of the other synonyms for that might be things like, well, obviously, the hammer isn't effective at getting a screw into the board, right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It could also be considered unwholesome, harmful, you know, ill."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's unsuitable, undesirable."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the wrong view to see the ocean is to look to the East."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The right view is to look to the West."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The Eightfold Path starts with right view, because this is the way that we're seeing, the way that we're going to engage, and it requires wisdom and discernment."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's two particular frameworks that the Buddha offered that are like those orientations, maybe, to help us find right view in there, the Four Noble Truths, and the idea of cause and effect, which Chris is going to talk about in detail."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I'm going to focus on the Four Noble Truths, but in particular, I'm going to focus on the first of the four."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the Four Noble Truths are that there is dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And dukkha is a word that can mean a whole range of things from unsatisfactoriness to discontent, to stress, to suffering, right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so there is dukkha, and it is to be understood."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The second noble truth is there is the cause of dukkha, which is generally considered clinging."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The third noble truth is dukkha, the end of dukkha, so dukkha ceases."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the fourth is the path that leads to the complete cessation, eventually, of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's the Noble Eightfold Path, which is to be developed."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there is dukkha is to be seen and understood."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There is the cause of dukkha, which is to be abandoned."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There is the ending of dukkha, which is to be realized."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then there is the path leading to the ending of dukkha, which is to be developed."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's some many places you will read that essentially the purpose of the path is to bring the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's one very important aspect."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I guess what I would say, and I'll talk a little bit more about this, is the end of suffering, what's this absence? What happens? Because that too is an aspiration for me."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "What happens when we aren't suffering? I'm actually touched about giving this part of the talk today and to talk about dukkha and our relationship to it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Because for me, the absence of dukkha is beautiful, you know, and I have a reverence for that experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it can be seen, maybe reflected in an open heart, in generosity, compassion, a clear and direct connection with others, with life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it's the absence of ill will and covetousness and not being ignorant to everything that's going on."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So in my time of practice, my relationship to suffering or dukkha has changed a lot."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "What I have come to see over and over again is that when I can recognize the arising or the presence of suffering or dukkha, that it's almost like the beginning of an opportunity for freedom."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I've developed a sense of trust and faith in the arising and the recognition of suffering, that there's a path, a way to suffer less."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so sometimes when I have a clear mind, when I see suffering, I see the arising of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's this sense of possibility, of freedom, and it's a very different response than when I used to see suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "A lot of initially when I would see suffering, there was a lot of contraction, oh no, and I'm claiming and ouch, and this is no good, right? But if I see suffering and I know that this is the beginning of the path to freedom, that happiness and faith can arise."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that energy is very uplifting and supportive."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The joy can bring energy with it to kind of move forward in the releasing of the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I've come to kind of relate to dukkha as a signpost, a flashing exit this way sign."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I've described it as the rumble strips on the side of a freeway."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, a half moon bay area, there are these rumble strips, and if you're looking out at this beautiful, gorgeous view and you aren't paying attention, your car starts to move off the road, your tires hit the rumble strips, and thank goodness, right, because they wake you up."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "They keep you on the path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "They keep you on the freeway."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And to me, this is how I have come to see, you know, the arising of dukkha is like, oh, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Another way to think about it is, you know, it's a beautiful, inherent, built-in feedback system."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, you know, if we're doing something with our body, let's say our hands, we're working with something, and we get a cut, there's pain."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's the natural feedback system that we've been hurt."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it says, okay, I need to stop, right? I need to stop."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I need to look and see what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And attend to it and stop doing what I was doing that caused the harm, right? And so the idea for me is, well, this is the same."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The dukkha of, you know, our lives when it happens is feedback."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So stopping when I recognize suffering becomes really important."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Somebody once, IMC created a bunch of bumper stickers that said, I stop for suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I like this idea of having, you know, bumper sticker, I stop for suffering, right? And my suffering, and yours too, yours too, are collective suffering, the suffering of our world, not to ignore that suffering too."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I'm talking about dukkha as feedback, a guidance as consequence, a stress, a lack of ease, tension, tightness."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It can be very subtle, you know, under ordinary circumstances, unrecognizable."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's something that is, you know, almost numbing and stopping in its tracks because it can be so painful, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Resistance, discontent, irritation, dissatisfaction."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it can be helpful also, maybe not to just sort of like, oh no, there's all this dukkha and I have to stop every time it comes up, but just sort of like relax around that and just be like, okay."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then there's another teaching on dukkha, which is trying to give us some different categories."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So just start with what shows up for you in your life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But if nothing's showing up, you might try looking in these different ways."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's three types of dukkha, pain of pain, pain of change and pain of mental construction."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So pain of pain is, you know, often like feeling pain around our pain, suffering because we hurt, suffering because the cut hurts because we're, you know, clinging to something and we're not getting what we want and we have pain around that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Pain of change has to do with impermanence and unpredictability in life and sort of change in relationships in the world and family configurations in our age, all these kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And pain of mental construction is a huge source of dukkha, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And this is pretty much about how we think about things, the mental construction and mental formations, you know, that are connected to the maintenance of our bodies of things and this kind of idea that things need constant care, constant upkeep."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's the things that keep us worried about the future or being remorseful about the past."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And in rumination, kind of this chugging going over and over, which is a really significant leading cause of depression, actually."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So just to give you a few simple examples from my personal experience, what I would say, pain of pain is pretty simple."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think example for me was one time, as an adult, I went to go get an immunization."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And for whatever reason, I was like bracing and tightening my muscle at the anticipation."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so my muscles tightened when I got the immunization."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And boy, did that cause a lot of physical pain that lasted way longer than if I had just relaxed and received the injection."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Pain of constructing thoughts, you know, this is something that I see in myself, you know, and it's, you know, let's see."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I don't actually understand the example I wrote here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I'm just going to, you know, we're, we can just create all kinds of things and constructions in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it's exhausting and consuming, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then there's the pain of change or impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So a big example for me was clinging to the idea or having this idea, a fixed idea that, you know, my marriage was not vulnerable to having affairs happen in it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I just thought, no way, never happened, but it did, right? And it made it all that much more painful for me because I had this really, I was really clinging to this identity of a person who would not be in a relationship where somebody would have an affair."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Right? So it led to a lot of extreme amounts of suffering, right? Because in particular, I was like, you know, denial about it happening couldn't be happening because I didn't believe it could be happening, right? And then there can be any combination of, I mean, one or all three of these kinds of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I think I'll end just sort of referencing the Aro-Sutta, the Salatha-Sutta, Samyuta Nakaya 366."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And we've probably, many of us have heard about the Aro-Sutta, right? So the someone gets shot with an arrow."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And, you know, that's just sort of what happens in life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then we say, oh, I'm such a bad person for being here and getting shot with an arrow."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's another arrow and the ways that we can just keep adding."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the Sutta says, the blessed one said, when touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, sorrows, grieves, laments, and beats his breasts, becomes distraught."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So he feels two pains, physical and mental, just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward to shoot him with another one."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So he would feel the pain of two arrows."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "In the same way, when touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed person, you know, sorrows and grieves, laments, beats their breasts, becomes distraught."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So he feels two pains, the physical and the mental."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So just, you know, Gil has a super simple example of this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "He talks about walking down the sidewalk, stubbing his toe, hurts."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then he says, oh no, what if somebody saw me? I'm a meditation teacher."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I'm supposed to be mindful, right? I can't let anybody see me stumble."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's the second arrow, right? And so on and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We continue on this, you know, and can be many, many, many arrows coming our way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the idea is, you know, if we had this other relationship with suffering and see it as a, you know, a signpost, a flag waving guidance, maybe we can notice a little sooner that we're hurting or things are getting harder."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And we can just kind of stop and pause, take some breaths, see if we can create some space."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "See if we can look at this, see the view that we're looking at this from and shift."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we have the ocean in front of us and the big sky and lots of room."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I'm going to invite Bruni to come in and she's going to, you know, give us some information about doing breakout groups and set us up for, you know, discussion around this kind of topic."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Thank you for those reflections, some wise view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And now we're going to go into breakout sessions to have an opportunity to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, excuse me, I haven't talking in a while."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "To share some reflections to build community to settle in with, you know, what you're listening to and receiving and please note, this is an opportunity that it can be beneficial if you speak or not."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there's not like a rule that things have to be a certain way with deception of some etiquette."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So let me give you some tips in terms of how to interact within the group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're going to have Ying, we're going to have groups of five and maybe four to five."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, so, and then each person will have three minutes to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So you will come together into a break group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And as you come together, know that you're also practicing, you know, where we have an opportunity to bear witness to listen mindfully is part of the practice is practicing daily life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Listen to what people will be sharing so there's going to be person one will be sharing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then we're going to listen without crosstalk, no crosstalk, no conversation but taking in taking in this person taking in the words."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then, after the three minutes and I will send a reminder and I will ring the bell at the three minutes for the next person to go in and take the turn, then the next person will speak."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the same thing will be in silence, we will take in this person."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then speaking mindfully to being aware feeling the body as you're speaking and listening to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then the next person and then the next person and then the next person and then for the groups that have four persons."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You can continue, you can start again maybe there was something that was not said or something like that so you have three additional minutes or you can take a break."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "However you want to do it but the important thing is that each person has enough time to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, I think you said Bruni that you were going to ring the bell between questions but they won't be able to hear a bell so you could send a message through the chat chat."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yes, I will send reminders next person next person."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, so whenever we are ready, our dear IMC host, Zoom host will send you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You haven't said the question yet."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Oops, look at me talking about speaking mindfully."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You see we're all practicing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So glad I'm not doing this alone."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, so the question is how might you practice with I break for suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Again, the question is how might you practice with I break for suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Taking a break taking a stop for suffering to see it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, so we total have about 15 minutes for this whole thing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "All right, so I'm going to open the room since I hear hearing you go."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think it should be done."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yeah, okay, so we have, we have few minutes to do some harvesting here of the community and so the invitation now is to have, you know, some of you that would like to to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "What did you learn what what was talked about in your group something that you would like to share with the rest of the community."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "This is, you know, almost like, it's almost like an act of generosity just to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, what did you hear what got your attention and briefly with ease we have maybe five, seven minutes to do this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the way to do it is if you go into into the chat and if you can raise your hand."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yeah, that's in participants."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "If you want to do it that way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, yes, in participants."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So you go to participants."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I see a set of hands already."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Shall we just go with the hands raised."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "This could be a misunderstanding either of what time you were sharing or my own previous learning but I thought the Duke of that we're trying to liberate ourselves from is all mental at some level right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "My foot or break my foot and is pain there but I personally don't have that suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It has to do with my reactivity or the mental aspect of how I react to life's events."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's more of a question."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, Tanya, I can I can just respond but since he made reference to the talk that you want to respond or No, I think you're right, Jerry."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think that maybe the part that you're the pain of pain like the different kinds of Duke that maybe my definitions there were made that a little bit confusing but no, they're absolutely we can't it's unavoidable to have physical pain."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I was I was sharing that I've been doing the readings and listening to to just talk and it seems that conceptually, I do understand what I'm reading when I'm listening but it doesn't doesn't stick you know it does it's like pass through me but I don't like when I'm having an insight that I can take it in this is different and it's been like a unique thing that's happened on my past so it feels gives me the feeling I don't know if I'm doing it well you know gives me I guess but then as I was listening to the small groups sanga suddenly I had this realization because I was trying why do I why don't I understand this you know I was trying to let it go but came back and then suddenly I said well would it help if you know maybe is it clear view you could maybe it's in the words is it is the words clear view the right way of understanding this if I say I want to see something clearly like something in my experience like I was I was experiencing I was in pain and then suddenly I realized okay this is pain and that for me seeing clearly would that be something closer to right view I just want to try to know in the experience beyond listening to the talks and reading I'm kind of trying to get it yeah yeah there's you know I just want a first to say to reassure that these questions may come up over and over again in our practice through all our lives and that and that yeah when we see sometimes we notice that okay this is like like Tanya was saying when when we see that there is something going on we call it we call it but we don't we don't cling to it we don't add is we don't identify with it in a way that we say you know this is my you know we don't add the story like Tanya was saying then it could be wise view but there may be more conversation about that later but yes that's part of that understanding and but there are many different ways and as we go deeper into the practice jaisha we embody we embody the it will just trust the practice and that you know set the conditions for the learning and it will unfold in that way but yeah if I say clear view if that word works for me is that okay to call it like that well I will let you know I will let Chris to talk about that just to give an opportunity to someone else because she's going to talk about the other noble truths and why is and and then maybe we can include their like why is and right and clear seeing clean clear view can can be added in other ways."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think this is something that Tanya said in her talk was that it was such a relief to know that I'm not the only one sort of struggle but this is a challenge for me right view is a challenge for me."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I personally think that if other stuff comes in, I'm doing it wrong and I forget this is a lifelong practice and it's not something you could flunk at unless you just quit altogether."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I wish it's real and real relieved and happy to learn that we're more alike than I thought."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That's fantastic Nancy and that he just made my day just to acknowledge that because you know that's like oh thank you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I appreciate hearing about the causes of clinging, the impermanence and kind of the obsession of the bondage."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "When life, my question is that when I can understand, I don't understand the difference like let's say you're a mother and you lose your infant child, let's just say that happens."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So you are going to be suffering and there will be that clinging, you know, loss and then the upset, you know, there is that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "How does that fit in with this teaching? If you could address that or if I should just wait and listen."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I mean I'm a little unclear about that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It seems like that is an appropriate part of life, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that yes, like, like disease and then so many losses that people are going through where we are going through these days too."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, and a tiny jumping it anytime here but what I would say is like you said, you just named the first novel truth when you said, this is, this is, this is suffering, this is, this is a loss, this is, it is."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so that acknowledgement, that acknowledgement without rejecting it, that is a way, that is a way to approach wise view, this is suffering, this is a loss."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Now, when we, when we dwell, not in our struggles, when we dwell, and it's not, you know, there is, there is a place for grief."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There is a place for struggles that we have to our own lives through our lives and we, we come to a way of acceptance with it and how to relate to them in a way that doesn't add additional suffering, the optional suffering that Tanya talked about."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But yes, we acknowledge we give it respect and we give it space."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There may be more that will resonate for you, Laura, and for others throughout the program."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I had in my notes, but there's one thing I didn't say that I really find helpful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Pain, so pain happens, loss, stubber toe, times resistance equals dukkha, suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there's the pain that's unavoidable, times are, is when we resist, when we have an attitude that is against it, we don't want it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That is, you know, there's a relational correlation to how much we suffer."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, dear community, dear friends, so now we are, what are we doing now? Let me just consult here with."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yeah, five minutes, five minute break."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Okay, the 235 will be back."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we'll take five minutes stretch break by our break right now."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So come on back if you're here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So when in the teachings about right view and what you'll read in the readings and what's found in the suttas, there is this point of view that the Four Noble Truths is an essential part of right view seeing suffering and what's suffering what's not suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the other part of it is coming to understand what you might call the conditionality of experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Tanya used the phrase cause and effect, which is the everyday understanding of what that means."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Although the Buddha, it's not so direct as cause and effect."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there's, you know, it's the Buddha was quite modern and realistic in his understanding of the vast web of conditions that go into enabling anything like the condition of having eyes is a condition for seeing and then, you know, the condition of being, I don't know, able to hear the teachings as a condition of making progress on this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's all, it's all, it reminds me also a lot of the current scientific understanding of brain plasticity, you know, that things can change."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "This is the good news part of the teaching."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we talked a little bit about suffering and the cause of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the second, in a way, this relates to the third and the fourth noble truths that it's actually possible to bring an end to this particular experience of dukkha that we're calling dukkha by working on the causes and conditions, the conditions that lead to it internally in our own minds and in society and how we interact with other people and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so that's the relationship of the third and fourth noble truths to conditionality is the good news part of it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So our happiness and our well-being depends on the conditioning that habits structures and our own deep understanding how we react to things."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So of course, Laura's question about what if something truly tragic like losing a child happens, there will be grief."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I like, I think it was a very appropriate answer to that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Grief is an appropriate response to that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But we can add on lots of levels like, oh, why me, why me, you know, how did I, maybe if I had, if only I hadn't, you know, left the window open or something."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You can torture yourself a whole lot in addition to the kind of relatively deep and clean and true feeling of grief when something like that happens."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So that level of suffering is what we're looking at."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "For me, a lot of the progress in the path has been coming over 25 years, coming to really understand for myself, what is the meaning of dukkha? And what is the meaning of not dukkha? What is it that we're actually letting go of? I had a very clear experience of, it's kind of silly, but it was very clear to me on a very early retreat that I went to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I had one of these things that's called, this was 25 years ago, a vipassana romance."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "In other words, I had to sort of crush on somebody I didn't know and hadn't seen and didn't know anything about."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But I just became obsessed with, where is this person? Are they looking at me? Where are they now? What am I going to say to them at the end? And I could see that my retreat was just being frittered away with this mental obsession."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then, but I couldn't stop it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then at some point I went for a walk in the woods and I got up to this beautiful clearing, beautiful blue sky and I noticed it's gone."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it was just the feeling of freedom from that mental obsession was so clear."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then I went back down and saw the guy again and the whole thing started up."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I got this very clear vision of dukkha, no dukkha, dukkha, and how it was going on in my mind and how it wasn't so simple to just stop it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So part of understanding the web of conditions is that it's a slow process to slowly work through seeing our habits, understanding what they are, the more clearly that we can let in the fact that, wow, this is suffering rather than entirely focusing on life happily ever after with this person I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But instead I can see the suffering in the moment and then the freedom without it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Something in us is learning and not at the pace of our conscious mind that we would like to just be able to fix this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's not like you can see a habit and change it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But over and over, drop by drop, we're letting in the truth and refining and sensitizing ourselves to the truth of what is, what am I adding to this? Where is the bodily contraction? What is the mental belief that's behind this? And getting a little space around our habits and slowly they begin to transform."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Another aspect of this conditioning is to understand that we're part of the flow of nature."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It is our nature to grasp at the pleasant and push away the unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So sometimes this path is called going against the stream, you know, going upstream."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're really taking a new look at human conditioning and it takes a long time to work through this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "One of my favorite teachings from the Sutta about right view is about a seed."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The miracle really, if you plant a bitter, gourd seed in the same ground, the same water, the same sunlight, the same earth, you get a very bitter plant."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "If you plant a sugar seed in the same ground, the same earth, you get a plant, I'll just read you this section."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "When a sugar cane seed is placed in most soil, whatever nutriment it takes from the soil and water, all conduces to its sweetness and tastiness and unalloyed delectability."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "In the same way, when a person has right view, which leads on to the rest of the path, the deeds that he undertakes in line with that view, whatever intentions, whatever vows, whatever fabrications, they all lead to what's agreeable."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's like a person, so right view kind of stands for the whole configuration of this seed that we have, I'm pointing at my head, but it's our whole body, our hearts, our minds."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "This configuration that we are when we come to this practice after a lifetime of conditioning, the experience that we take in leads to certain actions of bodily speech and mind."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And over time, if we have the view, the first transformative part of the view is let me look inward instead of always blaming outward, blaming and manipulating the world."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the kind of paradigm of wrong view is let me see what else I can do to try to get the whole world to line up and be exactly the way I think it should and expect it to stay that way and blame other people when it isn't."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So that is not right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So right view is, hmm, how am I responding to this? Difficult tragic situations happen, but what's my attitude toward it? How am I relating to it? How am I tensing up unnecessarily? How am I mentally proliferating around trying to fix things that I can't fix or trying to feel that I shouldn't feel the way I feel? So all that is right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it doesn't mean that you have immediately the knowledge of what to do about any particular situation, but it means that you're starting to look at the complexity of this whole web of conditioning in words and how we interact with other people's webs of conditioning and you begin to understand, begin to see people as webs of conditioning when you see how hard it is to change your own habits, maybe you're more forgiving of other people who have a hard time changing their habits."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so gradually this whole web of conditioning becomes something that's workable."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's more workable with right view than, you know, unhelpful views are many, you know, like I have to get the whole world perfect before I can stop worrying, you know, or before I can relax or before I can allow myself to just go for a walk in the park or something."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So so many views, views of blaming yourself, blaming other people rather than looking at the conditions of nature that have unfolded over the whole history of humanity and all of our lifetimes as coming to this moment."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And in the present moment is when it's possible to inject new stuff into the web of conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So how you react has to do with what habits are you reinforcing and what what patterns are you what beliefs are you once again buying into."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "How are you filtering what you take in of what's happening by your views so that you're not letting in fresh information."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the typical ways that we do this are by not seeing the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So our minds focus on something like wouldn't that be a great relationship to have forever, ignoring the fact that, you know, it's just for so many reasons not realistic."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then you focus on that imagined happiness and you don't notice you're wasting your whole retreat, obsessing and suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So if you can turn and notice that and then appreciate the freedom of that if you get a little moment or that gradually it begins to untangle that web."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yeah, then the whole path really this fourth noble truth is about it's like eight different mirrors or eight different practices that we can use to start to see more deeply into what is this conditioning that we have."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And how can we skillfully work with dismantling it reconditioning it to be more wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So often the question that the Buddha asks is what ask us to ask is what when I do it leads to long term happiness and well being for myself and others."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So this long term short term is another interesting factor to start working with."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're very conditioned in our animal nature to go for short term gratification, right, addictions."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Anything that was pleasant before we want it again anything that was the least bit unpleasant we don't want anything to do with again."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So part of what we can start to disentangle is the difference between immediate pleasant and unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The actual non correlation between immediate pleasant and unpleasant and long term wholesome and unwholesome or skillful and unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So this this pair of words, Akusala and Akusala are important in right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "They're translated two different ways in English typically wholesome and unwholesome and skillful and unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And both of those are beautiful wholesome really calls to mind."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's good for other people."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's wholesome and then it uses all of our faculties."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're not giving up our intelligence on this path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're bringing our bodies."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're bringing all these things to play and really trying to sense into what is a wise response to this situation."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there's wholesome and of course that's also skillful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And we like skillful a lot in English because it's really different from something like sinful, you know, or stressing all that stuff."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Somebody's to blame blaming and shaming is a whole important layer of not really understanding right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Because if you're going to blame yourself for your conditioning, you know, you might as well blame the Big Bang, right? If you're going to shame yourself for not being able to change as fast as you want."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Welcome to being human, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's not skillful to do those things."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's skillful to look at, let me see what I can learn from this."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, in that moment of action or in that moment of reaction, mindfulness and maybe right speech and compassion, those qualities were just not developed enough."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The old habits were stronger and they got the upper hand that time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But what, but now you know, now the conditioning web has changed because each moment it's changing by how you act in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So each moment of wise intending in the present starts to slowly affect the whole web of conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it may go differently next time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Next time, if the stronger you remember what happened this time, the more likely you are to have a little more space around it next time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So in that way, this conditioned view of things is really important for right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The unwholesome and the unskillful is usually summarized by the three words of the three roots of greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Greed is this grasping for really more than, you know, it doesn't mean you don't hold on to your glass of water or you don't reach for food when you need it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But this kind of unrealistic grasping, that's why I call it greed, trying to get more out of something than you can, and you, it's really going to give you getting more than you need."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then hatred, you know, if it's unpleasant, boy, we, we more than just say, oh, that's unpleasant, we begin to hate it and try to plot for its extermination."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, that, that level of reactivity, it's hurting us and it's causing tremendous reactivity in other people and keeps the world spinning on in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And delusion is not seeing clearly."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So this comes back to the translation that Ying offered and one of you commented on a clear, clear seeing, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And another, that brings us in terms of what is clear seeing, that brings us to the final aspect of right view that I want to talk about here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There are three perceptions that the Buddha highlights as being those that begin to shift the more our view gets cleared up."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So the clearer and clearer view we have, we've talked a lot about one of them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "The more clearly we see suffering, the less we're fooled into thinking it's worth a lot of stress to get, you know, even more money or even more partners or whatever, you know, people accumulate."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's, it's not worth, we clearly see the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the second one is that we begin as we pay that clear and direct attention to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We see the constantly changing nature of things, you know."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we were less often fooled by thinking if only I could get that, then I'd be happy forever or that will last forever."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Or we don't take our moods so seriously because we know things are going to change."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And at some very deep level as we see into it, we really realize that it's not worth, nothing is worth clinging to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "This extra clinging, we're clinging to the unrealistic is another way of putting it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, of course, if you're hanging over a cliff, you're going to cling."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But clinging to the unrealistic expectations that you have out of things is unrealistic, mental clinging like that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's the long exploration of becoming more and more sensitive to what is meant by mental clinging."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, clinging, conceptual clinging."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, thinking you understand what those people think because you put a label on them, for example."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, and then they say something else or clinging to, I don't know, finding some way to get everybody to agree with each other, you know, may never happen."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So clinging to all kinds of unrealistic beliefs and expectations is asking for suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then the third, so that's called that we have this insight about duke, facing duke, the insight about the impermanent and kind of unreliable nature of things we try to cling to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the third thing is we begin to take experience less personally."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that totally comes out of this web of conditioning, where we're seeing that it's not me who wasn't able to do that right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's the conditions to not support being able to do that right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that does not mean they won't in the future."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It means here's an opportunity to, you know, put some good into that network and see what happens in the future, keep your eyes open, keep paying attention."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we take things less personally."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're not so oriented around judging ourselves as I'm stupid, because I can't get everything to stop."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I can't get suffering to stop."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So there's something wrong with me."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We don't do so much self image maintenance, like what does everybody else think of me."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, we're not trying to keep up our appearances under right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're trying to really figure see what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, when we're less invested in making sure that we look good, and more invested in trying to see, well, how are we."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And what does it take to really be good."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Holding on to things as mine."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, this is my success, even though probably hundreds of people contributed to it, something like that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, it's yours temporarily, even if you bought it, you're kind of renting it for a portion of your lifetime until it falls apart or goes somewhere else or something happens to it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "There's much less focus on, on that becomes natural when you see that what that does is add clinging and muck up the clarity of seeing the web of conditions and how you can work with them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I like this phrase from Ajahn Amaro he talks about a disentangled participation in life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we're not turning off life, we're not detaching, we're not, you know, just going to go sit in a cave forever."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But we're disentangling from all the ways that we're completely, you know, interwoven with what everybody else thinks and what everybody else thinks of you and what might happen and what did happen and what should have happened and all those things we do with our minds."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We're disentangling, but we're still participating."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's so much easier and refreshing to be able to participate in life without all that entanglement."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I often like to read this quote from Henry David Thoreau, who's one of my favorite people, he says, I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's something to be able to paint a particular picture or carve a statue and make a few objects beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But it's far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do to affect the quality of the day that is the highest of arts."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So this points to the fact that this is like an art form, you know, we're gradually, gradually shaping this web of conditioning that we're a part of from our own little perspective on it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I love that he says morally, morally we can do, because there is this deep relationship between what we usually consider moral or ethical intentions, intentions of non-harming, non-greed, non-hatred that are woven into the path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the beautiful thing to discover is this mutual relationship between what's good for us and what's good for other people."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So on the path we're breaking this vicious circle of reactivity in two ways."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "With respect to what you might call incoming difficulties, things that life throws at you, things other people say and do, we're learning to suffer less, to have more equanimity, to be able to take it less personally, to let it flow through us without triggering a huge reaction."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then with respect to our outgoing actions of body, speech, and mind, we're working on our conditioning and our reactivity so that what we put out into the bigger web, not only the web of our own conditioning, but the bigger web of all the interbeing of everyone, what we're putting out is less harmful and we give others the gift of space to feel a little safer and maybe they can be less reactive and in that way the whole thing has the potential to turn into a more positive cycle instead of a negative cycle."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then when we really learn what works to transform the heart and mind of one person, namely ourselves, if the more we really understand that the wiser we can be in our efforts to try to help other people change or influence what's going on in the wider world."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I hope that was a little bit clarifying about another way of understanding the right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "It's working on this conditioning, working on our conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So we have another breakout here, which, yeah, we can do."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We'll just, we'll just do it and have a little less time at the end or we'll have what time we have at the end for feedback."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, let me just send the prompt to everyone so that you see it too."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We'll go back again into groups, three minutes each, please time yourself just to make it simpler logistically."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the prompt is, can you think of a time when shifting your perspective, your thinking, or your attitude toward some situation."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, that time that you have seen that you have shifted your perception thinking or attitude to it towards a situation and has given you more ease, even with circumstances staying the same."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Can you remember of one time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so please share your insights on that experience that experience of shifting way of looking at things, even when circumstances have not changed conditions are the same but your way of relating to it has changed."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, again, three minutes each person."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "One person at a time, not cross talk, bearing witness, practicing mindful listening and mindful speaking."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, I think I'm ready to send you all to the rooms again and so just hanging there."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, dear friends, we're back."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so now we have a few minutes here to do more harvesting, you know, to report back any kind of reflections on the groups."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And any other questions, but you know if you can share first you know what what happened in your group that will be great."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And any other questions are welcome to and we have."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so we can do that with again with the blue hand."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I just wanted to share the incredibly personal stories that people shared about their change of perspective."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Their perspectives were very tender, very personal stories and it was very meaningful to me."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, that just reminds me that I don't, I don't know if we spoke about privacy, but let's keep what happens here within, you know, within the group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So just, you know, respect each other's privacy here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, even cultivating even, even the safety and, and, you know, the, the, the container for us to be as authentic as we can and be supporters on the path."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So, we also have, let's say, Christine was next."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I'm learning so much today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I feel like I don't remember enough on, you know, I'll watch it again, probably."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But it was wonderful to hear people talking about putting on the brakes, you know, for the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "For every one of us, there was a payoff for not continuing and escalating and adding the second arrow to the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I realized for myself that this didn't come right away, you know, I've been practicing this for a long time and at first you have to kind of slam on the brakes, you know, and gradually, I mean, eventually I want to get to where I just don't have to put the brakes on that things are just going smoothly."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And as soon as I feel anything, I can just slow down instead of slamming on the brakes."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I also love the word that you used harvesting, because I always think of things in terms of gardening myself."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that was a beautiful word."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "For me, the change of perspective was on this COVID-19."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We were sent to work at home."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And at the beginning, it was okay."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But now I changed the way I think about my coworkers."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I try to be more intimate, less, it just works more people."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And we've been able to share a lot of other things like family and dogs and plants."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I think that that force change, not that missing them, I was able to change that missing for what am I going to do? I'm going to try to relate more, even if by phone or computer."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "That's a change that make my life easier, because at the beginning I was just angry, because I had to be away from them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So one thing I noticed in our group was that after shifting perspective, we ended up taking things not as personally."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I think we did mention that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I also put it together that with the two questions, stop breaking for suffering and then shifting perspective."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I think it makes a lot of sense because they go together because first you need to recognize and acknowledge the suffering and then try to change your perspective."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So yeah, I just realized that and that was really nice."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "My personal example of changing perspective was my mom nagging me before it used to be a little bit annoying until I realized, well, someone helped me realize that it's an expression of love."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it went from annoying to gratitude just, you know, that perspective."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And Susan is the next on the list."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "You know, we don't need to go into this too much, but I will say I did notice that sometimes maybe in the past, it was more helpful when I use the term pleasant or unpleasant when I went through an experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But lately, I'm like, I'm having a bad thing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I've had it now, like three days."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Normally very, but I sort of made this decision to not say anything about it in my mind and to really watch that pain."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "When I'm sitting, you know, I notice when I sit back, it has a certain flavor."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "When I'm sitting in meditation, it has a certain flavor."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I want to talk a little bit, but I noticed when I label it unpleasant, a lot of judgment comes in."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that wasn't necessarily the case before, maybe that was more helpful before, but now there's lots."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So now I'm thinking maybe I just want to stay away from the whole pleasant, unpleasant, even wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I've been saying to myself, is it useful? Is whatever thought is coming up, is it useful? You know, and I thought maybe, anyway, maybe that's too big of a subject or whatever, but it sort of came up today when we were talking about wholesome and wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Pleasant, unpleasant, skillful, unskillful, that kind of thing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And yeah, as we go through practice, we learn how it is that different words resonate and, you know, trust your practice and we'll learn what arises and how it is that we can practice in a wise way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So it's great to be here and I really did get a lot from the small group sharing of examples and stuff and thank you to all those that I got to talk to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I feel like my perspective is shifting constantly and the query was for around, you know, a right view sort of positive outcome and it's just also occurring to me that my mind can shift in perspective to a negative wrong view very easily also."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But I was curious to know if the small groups were randomly put together because we had the same exact group both times and I was just wondering if that was a flu or did you try to keep the groups the same."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So that was one thing I wanted to ask."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Yeah, yeah, I was jumping and say that I tried to create a different group the second time, but I didn't find the right option."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So I tried to manually kind of shuffle some people around, but there is a lot of groups I may not have get get around to kind of shuffle enough in the groups."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But the intention is to hopefully create a different configuration and I have to look into this option next time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Thank you very for bringing it up."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then Sean and then ginger."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I wanted to be here I'm up here in Canada and our group wonderful group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We were talking about that."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But what I wanted to share as I was listening to the other people share what I found is both in the first breakout and the second."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "We all seem to come back to this examining the source of our suffering within as well as applying compassion to ourselves, being overwhelmed by the world and everything else."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And I might share that that I thought I was alone in that feeling demoralized and overwhelmed by all the suffering in the world."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so we all seem to have a similar experience."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then we have one last person and then we can move into our closing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Just because I just called in yeah."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I just want to say two things really quick."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "One is that I love the word skillful because that I mean first it implies that that you're doing things in a way that that is appropriate to the task at hand."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "But also it implies that you can learn how better to do it because you learn skills you build your skill set."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And that's the first thing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And the second thing was really quick that the rumble strip imagery was incredibly powerful for me and immediately it made."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "I was like, I've been driving on the rumble strip for two months."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Like, I need to get back in the middle of the road."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And it's just just wonderful to see, you know, all our community here and all these voices from different places, different experiences."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And now I will pass it to Ying."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "So in the spirit of today's teaching, and the whole path of practicing with a noble eightfold path, we're practicing this not only for ourselves, but also for all beings, beings that we come in contact with."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so in our meetings together, we'll have this little ritual and to allow ourselves to maybe find ways to express this inspiration."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And so if you just like to sit, take maybe a posture that feels dignified and a sense of respect of the teaching and fellow practitioners that all came together today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And if you wish to close your eyes, feel free to do so."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And if this teachings and sharing discussion touched you in some way today, touched your heart, you felt physically in the body in some way, that is nourishing, or maybe bring a sense of well-being, a sense of all."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "May that bring benefit to you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And may this benefit that through this practice today and discussions touch other people around you, maybe just this 120 or so people, 30 or so people in the Zoom room today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "May all beings in this room feel the benefit of the teachings and the practice."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And then allow this being a source of wonder to touch all beings around you, your family, friends, your neighbors."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "Allow them to carry this nourishment and allow them to benefit all people around them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "May the whole world benefit from this teaching and from your practice."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (guided Ying, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris, Breakouts Bruni)", "completion": "And we will regroup next month and take good care."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's going to be that kind of refuge from that world."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And as we have before, we start informally, which is if you have any questions about what I taught last week, about your own practice, or if you want to just simply report how it's working for you to do the meditation at home."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Any questions? It all seems crystal clear."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "This is a nice time to have a little informal beginning because people are still coming in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, I don't want to be reluctant to start with my talk."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, anything that you'd like."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Gail, I've been trying one of the forms of meditation that Buddha did not recommend, but I'd like your comment on it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I kind of call it meditation while driving, because I do that a lot."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But in trying to be in the body, which I do during other meditation, I focus on the sensation of the palms of my hand and the wheel, or the features of the other driver, or of course the other car."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Could you call me about that? I think two Buddhist teachers that I know, colleagues, have written books on mindful driving."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I think it's an important area to be mindful of."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's also very interesting to study the nature of awareness while you're driving."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because even though you might be daydreaming and thinking about the things, having a conversation with someone in the car, there is a kind of heightened awareness that has to be in the present moment when you drive, where it's usually more consequential if you're not than almost any other thing you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, it's interesting to kind of notice what kind of attention you have while you're driving that keeps you driving safe, and how that's in the present moment, and the kind of alertness that it has, and the kind of relationship it has with destructive thoughts and hindrances that might come up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because usually you stay on track well enough, usually driving, so what is that that's going on? And sometimes by studying that, you can get a sense of a heightened, kind of nice heightened awareness for meditation as well."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's many choices of what to do when you're driving for people who have a tendency of getting very concentrated, choosing one thing like the hands on the steering wheel could actually be a problem because they can get so focused on that sensation that they're not paying attention to what's going on around."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Other people will find that having some primary grounding like that keeps them in the present moment, and they're actually much more present and alert than they would be if they were not having, didn't have that anchor."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, that's possible to have that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I find that it's helpful to stay in my body and have some attention to my posture when I'm driving."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Same is true in working on a computer, that's paying attention to the posture because if the posture goes, if we become inattentive to the posture and the posture slumps or does what it does, it makes it less likely that we're going to be alert in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, take a posture that has some semblance of being alert."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "For me, the most important thing about driving and being mindful is in fact to stay in the present moment and stay open and aware of what's happening in my surroundings as I do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, to have my awareness be open and relaxed and moving so I can see the rear of your mirror, what's going on left and right, what's going on in the front, but all of the time staying in the present moment and sometimes being more than mindful, there's, in Buddhism there's a companion mental activity to mindfulness and that's in the Buddhist language is called clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, you wouldn't just simply be mindful, you'd clearly comprehend what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Like you notice it's a car coming in from the right, but you can just notice it and just keep driving and have a wonderful collision."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just notice that and, you know, or you can notice it's a car coming from the right and say, oh, this I need to pay attention to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's a stop sign there, but I notice that, but sometimes people don't stop for stop signs."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, I think this is a time to have heightened attention there and not kind of lose track of that person who's coming."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so, there's kind of a heightened kind of engagement, questioning, wondering, understanding what's going on that sometimes is really key for driving and sometimes is also key for mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There can be a kind of a clear, a clear comprehension of what's happening in present moment more than just simply being aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, I don't know if that addresses your question."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just an observation about emotions this week."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I think I never noticed the embodiment of the emotion so much."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I thought it's mostly in my head and I don't know where else, but anyway, it helps me not react so much right away as soon as I feel something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, feeling it in the body, which is a surprise for you, but if you do that, you're less likely to be reactive."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Do you have any guess why? How does that work? How does being aware of it in the body help you be less reactive? Because I was busy feeling it rather than getting back."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, you're more involved in feeling it rather than caught up in the story and the event and all that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Another thing that can happen is once we're in the body, there's a deeper understanding of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when you really feel an emotion in a body, if it's a tense motion, an emotion that's kind of afflictive or problematic or painful, it tends to soften and relax if we feel it in the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If we know we're having it and just know it mentally, it's too easy that the mental reactivity to it becomes second arrows, add to it and fuel it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It was very unfamiliar to try to feel it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the more familiar it gets, the more wonderful it is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's really nice to feel it through your body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I have actually felt two experiences."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The first one is that when I could be able to notice the body sensation more, even before coming thought or emotion, I could be able to notice how my body reacts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Before you feel the emotion? Emotion."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then I noticed that my breath is very fast or maybe I'm anxious."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "After that only I could be able to see the story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So that was kind of a little bit surprised."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And another one is that last week was kind of very stressful for me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I noticed I was trying to test that raft, whatever it was, and in one incident when I was just noticing and I was just seeing how my mind creates so many arrows, but I have kind of gone so down here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You know, maybe I got engrossed in the story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I didn't realize when I engrossed in the story versus when the body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yes, that becomes one of the things of practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the more you become familiar with what it feels like physically in the body, the less likely you are to be tripped up or influenced by the story mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if we're not grounded in the body, it's very easy to be swept away by the story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But I noticed that I could be able to understand myself better, how I react and how emotion actually affecting the body and not even mind actually the body so much."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yes, so as people become more mindful, there's a variety of connections they start seeing in their system here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And one is that the connection between thinking, stories, and the emotions and how it affects the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And sometimes it's the other direction, which I think you alluded to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Sometimes you feel what's going on in the body and then you see how that triggers an emotion or that triggers a story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so seeing the cause and effect relationship can be freeing because it starts seeing more impersonal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like, I didn't direct this, I didn't plan this out."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There was a sensation in my body and I remembered, you know, being on vacation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then I started having vacation thoughts and planning my next vacation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It all started with a sensation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or you have some thought that was unbidden comes up and it's your, you know, your high school sweetheart who you hate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so, you know, you still have resentment towards."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so suddenly you feel all this heat coming up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It was just a thought about that sweetheart."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you see that cause and effect relationship can go in different ways."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's very helpful to see that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I noticed when I went very downhill, I noticed that it was too much."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And after that, I kind of got very disappointed, like, oh my God, I notice it so early and how did I got so tripped down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But after that, when I became kind of very self-compassionate to myself, saying that, okay, fine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Then I could able to come out of fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Is there a light? Hold it this way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it's kind of more horizontal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "My question relates to pain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I've been having some neck pain the last days."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And today, it became much worse."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I was trying to use some of the Buddhist practices to deal with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I didn't know if I should focus on the pain or if I should get some distraction from it so that it wouldn't hurt that much, so that I wouldn't be so impressed."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "How should I do that? It's a good question you're asking yourself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The general approach in mindfulness is to feel physical pain, to bring your attention to it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the primary reason is not to make it go away, but so that we don't have any second arrows."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So that we don't react to it or contract around it or hate it or be upset with us or get angry."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we don't have all these secondary layers to it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it can just be kind of simple pain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And many times pain gets worse if we get complicated mental reactions to it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So sometimes by focusing on pain, you can begin teasing away the secondary reactions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it can be a lot easier then."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So that's one possibility."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The other possibility is some kinds of pain is actually useful to distract yourself from them because it lets something go or relax that can't relax if we're focusing on it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And sometimes with some neck pain, you have to be careful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I don't know what kind of pain it is because sometimes a very important option is do what you can so you don't have it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So some people like for meditation will do meditation lying down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I've known people who've had serious neck problems and they sit up with a chair against a wall and they put a cushion or pillow underneath the back of their neck like this so they're resting so their neck doesn't hurt."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because depending on the kind of pain, if you want to be careful, it's not a pain that aggravates it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yeah, I just want to share something, what happened last week."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was kind of running for a half marathon and I never run more than eight miles in my life and whatever practice I did."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was kind of completely killed that I'm not going to make it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when I was kind of running nine miles, I'm kind of complete the nine miles, I found that there is a wall in front of me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "My body is in pain and I can see myself that I have two personalities there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "One personality is telling me you can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Another personality is kind of teensy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So at that time, I was kind of doing whatever I've learned in this class."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Kind of body meditations and the mind and all those things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The good part is that I made it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I kind of like to share that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And what do you think it is about being mindfulness to your body, your mind? How did that help you? So naturally, one part was that my body was in complete pain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "My legs are paining because I've never done that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was kind of completely focused on those pain areas."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I found that, okay, the pain is going to go away."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If you focus on it? Yeah, focus on that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I still am walking, though I cannot run, but I still am walking while doing the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Other part was that because I can figure out that there is two of me, one which is saying that you are a loser, you can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I'm focusing on that part, that emotion and I figured out that that's kind of mellowed down and my positivity become more stronger and kind of give me feelings that I can do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Plus at the same time my body pain is completely gone, I can say, okay, I can move."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And actually after that, I will start running."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So which I can't believe in myself that how can I run after that big while."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And normally if you have these voices in your head that says I can't do it, I'm a loser, what would the usual effect be for that, for you? Naturally it will give me negative impact plus the pain is coming, so it will stop me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Stop you, it's going to give you, you feel more drained and more tired and more painful and just discouraged."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Excuses saying that, okay, my ligaments is not holding me or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I'll say and I'll kind of say, okay, I can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you saw it as just part of your mind that you didn't have to believe."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you didn't get pulled into it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it didn't have any much influence on you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I wanted to circle back to the first question you answered where you talked about clear comprehension in relationship to mindfulness and gave that example of you could see a car merging into your lane and respond to it or just note that it's coming and have a crash."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I'm so glad you brought that up because I've been thinking about clear comprehension in relationship to mindfulness lately."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I had a situation yesterday where I noticed myself being rather greedy about something trivial."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There was some chicken in the house in the refrigerator that I didn't want to share by roommate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I didn't even know that this discursive thought was happening until suddenly I just it became very apparent that I was thinking this thought and my relationship to the preset precepts came up not being possessive."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And as soon as I saw that next to not being possessive my ethics it was very easy to drop it to drop that thought just to let it go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I don't want to be doing that drop."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so that struck me as an example of mindfulness unifying with the teachings."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so what my question is relates to what I hear a lot of modern day mindfulness teachers saying which is that mindfulness is bare attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I think what John Kabat-Zinn says is paying attention to the present moment on purpose without judgment like just blank screen."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that doesn't have that aspect of clear comprehension in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was just wondering if you could talk about that contrast of teachings there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Well I mean if we go back to the Buddha's teachings he sometimes used the word for mindfulness which is sati and the word for clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Sampajana as a compound word so that they're really integrated together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But sometimes they're treated separately as two distinct things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I think of mindfulness in the teachings of the Buddha to be what we would nowadays call awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that sampajana that's clear comprehension is just that it's clearly recognizing and understanding what we're looking at, what we're aware of."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the two work really well together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The modern practice of mindfulness as it comes in the Buddhist tradition tends, at least what I learned in Burma, tends to emphasize clear comprehension more than the awareness part."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so when they use the word mindfulness as if it means clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But the two go hand in hand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can't get very far from one if you do the other."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "They kind of support each other, they come together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if you develop strong, stable awareness in the present moment, it's kind of natural to start having clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's just kind of what the mind does."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The cognitive functioning of emptiness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Would you say that the teaching of that bare awareness or bare attention teaching is lacking in a sense because it doesn't always include that clear comprehension aspect? Yeah, I don't know what to say."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And your questions are quite good, but this is the beginning class."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I don't want to lose everyone who's here to get into the subtleties of all this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I can always ask you later."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so, okay, so today we're going to talk about thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And to introduce this topic, I want to teach you a analogy or a little story, a teaching story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Imagine that you're out for a nice walk."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's a nice day, sunny and beautiful day out in nature and some nice forested area, meadow area."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You're walking along and enjoying it and all that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then in the distance, there's a nice river that's going down and a nice river bank and a beautiful oak tree that's up in the edge of the river."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you say, that's a good place to rest."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you go there and sit with your back against the oak tree and you bring out your lunch."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You're just watching the river go by and it's so relaxing, peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You feel like it's been a good day."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Nothing to do, nowhere to go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just be here and it's nice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you notice that coming down the river is this big New Orleans showboat with dancers and music and bands and probably casinos and great food and whatever the temptations might be."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the next thing you know, you're on the riverboat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But the next thing it means two or three days later, you realize what happened."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I was so content and happy on the river bank under the oak tree."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And now I've been like several days on this riverboat and I'm getting tired."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you finally get off the boat somewhere, managed to trek all the way back up to your oak tree and you sit there finally, oh, this is good."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "This is heaven to be here again."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then this big war boat comes down the river."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's fighting the great war, the good cause."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And guns are shooting and big banners, the cause."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And next thing you know, you're on that boat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you're on that boat for a few weeks because it's really justified."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And after a few weeks, I was there sitting so nicely on the river bank."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And what am I doing on this big war boat? So you go back up and you find your way back to the oak tree."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And next time there comes this like coming down the river is this decrepit, you know, barely held together all little kind of raft that, you know, just half under the water and just like it's, you just feel sorry just looking at it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the next thing you know, you're on that poor raft."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "This is going to be the end."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it takes you a few months to realize you're on that boat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you finally get yourself off and get back to the oak tree."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then finally sitting down the oak tree, you realize, you know, I don't have to get on any of those boats."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I can just let the boats go right by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So this is an analogy for what we can do with our thoughts and meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We can get on those thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We can get involved and ride those thoughts for a few hours or days or years or a lifetime, you know."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Some people get onto certain thoughts and they never get off."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or we can learn to get off onto the dry, secure shore where we're kind of safe and, you know, solid."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or we can learn how not to get on to begin with and be able to just watch the thoughts go by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then, you know, there's a river boat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I've been on that, but I don't need to do that today."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You wave as you go to wave as it goes by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So what mindfulness allows you to do if you're in the present moments well enough to track what's going on, to kind of notice when things happening, is you can notice a thought coming."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can notice it passing by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you can notice the tendency to want to get on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or you can notice the tendency to stay here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "No, I'm going to stay here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I'm just going to watch it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You know, and I don't have to get."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And one of the ways just to watch it is not to take it personally, which means don't, you don't judge it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't feel bad about it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't feel bad about yourself because you're having that thought."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't praise yourself for having the good thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't criticize yourself for having bad thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't even see, almost like you don't even see the thoughts as my thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "One meditation teacher I know, he made the exercise of whatever thoughts he had in his head while he was meditating, he imagined they came from the person behind him."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so then he took them much less personally and he would just, they would just, you know, let them just go right by, you know, and not get involved."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And part of the reason I'm not getting involved in thoughts is that thoughts have a huge influence on us if we're in their grip."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the shape of this thoughts, the subject of thought, the emotions connected to the thoughts can have a much bigger impact on us if we're involved in the thinking, if we've gotten into them and thinking them and all that, then if we just sit back and watch them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "In this regard, I like to distinguish between thinking and thought-ing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Thought-ing is what the mind does."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The mind kind of is a thought-ing machine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It means it just makes thoughts will bubble up and then it bubbles, it's kind of apt for, the thoughts just appear."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Thinking is when we get involved with the thoughts and we start associating, you know, one thought after the other."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So a car goes by and you think, oh, that's a car."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Then you say, that sounded like a really good car and I need a new car and I wonder what it was and probably I should get a red car next time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And there's a chain of associated thinking and you've gotten hooked in, one is hooked into the next because I'm interested in it, I'm involved in it, as opposed to just letting it be, oh, there's a car going by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's a very simple, innocent thought."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So those simple, innocent thoughts often can be what the mind does."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The thinking is when we start getting involved and the idea in mindfulness is to stay on the solid shore, relaxed, back against the oak tree, at ease and just leave it alone and let it go by, let it go by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just let it go, let it go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Almost as if this has nothing to do with me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Does that make some sense? So we're going to do a couple of meditations today."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the first will be a very simple kind of mindfulness meditation that's kind of, well, introduced mindfulness of thinking in the most simplest way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then we'll talk a little bit more and then after this I'll do another meditation which will be an exercise."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "An exercise where you explore the terrain of your thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can become much more familiar with what actually thinking is, what kind of processes it is, all the different aspects of it when it occurs."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can learn to pay attention to it without getting mesmerized by the content of the thoughts, what you're actually thinking about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So those are the kind of the plan here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we'll start with a basic meditation so you can take an upright sitting posture."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And gently close your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then take a few long, slow, deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "As you breathe in deeply, feel your chest torso expand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And long exhale in which you relax and settle into your body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then letting your breathing return to normal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And taking a minute or so to scan through your body to see if there's any obvious places that you can relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Maybe you can soften the muscles of your face."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Soften around the shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It'll be helpful to soften the belly so the belly hangs forward and down a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then see if you can find some place in your body that feels like a neutral place."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's not any particular discomfort where there's not any strong associations that make it complicated."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "One possibility is to feel your right hand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's a place that's neutral."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And let your awareness roam around in that neutral area in the hand, for example."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's no particular purpose for this exercise except to help you be in the present moment in a relaxed way, feeling something simple."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And seeing if you can let your awareness be clear, clearly aware of that part of your body, so clearly aware of the sensations of your hand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "At the same time that the awareness is not leaning into it, pushing, straining, or the awareness is not casual or indifferent or hesitant."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "A simple, direct, relaxed awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So then bring your awareness to that part of your body where you most clearly experience breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And as you feel this part of your body, see if you can have the same kind of relaxed, clear awareness as you did for the neutral place without being for or against anything, without trying to do anything except to be present and aware."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if the mind wanders off into thought and you notice that, begin again with your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Feeling equally the inhalation and the exhalation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Perhaps letting go of your thoughts as you exhale."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Adjusting your awareness so it's not pushing or straining, but also not casual or indifferent or hesitant."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Awareness which is direct and present, is clear of the breathing as the body breathes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if the mind wanders off into thought and you notice that, begin again with your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And now you can stop paying attention to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And instead, just be attentive to your mind thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You're allowed to think, but turn your attention clearly and directly to recognize that you're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That you're seeing the boats go by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If the thoughts disappear as you look at them, you can go back to your breathing until thinking begins again."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then look thinking right in the eye."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Recognizing this is a thought."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Some people think more in words, some people think in images."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Whatever it is, just know it's happening as it's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Being careful that your awareness is not straining or pushing, but also not pulled back or hesitant or too casual."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Clear awareness of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And as thinking occurs, or as thinking reappears, is there any emotion connected to your thinking? It could be quite subtle, or any mood associated with your thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if there is, be aware of that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Some river boats are emotion boats."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And now return to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And allow yourself to feel the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out as it's experienced in the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then the last couple of minutes of the sitting."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If you find yourself thinking, take a moment to clearly recognize thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Look at it directly, recognize it as thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if it feels like it's well acknowledged, maybe then you can come back to your breathing without being easily pulled into the world of thoughts again."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you can come back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you can come back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you can come back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then to end this sitting, you can take a few deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Feel yourself sitting against the chair or the floor or cushion."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when you're ready, you can open your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So the idea of mindfulness meditation is to learn how to be mindful of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Anything that's happening that's prominent in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So when we do mindfulness meditation, it's not pushing things away or ignoring things, but rather learning to turn towards what's happening so we can see it clearly rather than being pulled into its orbit or rather than resisting it or pushing it away."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we start with breathing, but we're ready to let go of the breathing if something else is more prominent, more compelling."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then in a matter of fact way, bring our attention to that thing which is a compelling event."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If it's physical sensation in the body, we bring the attention there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I don't know if it worked for you, the neutral place to feel like in your hand or something, where you can kind of be present for something without any reactivity, without being for or against it, without judging it or feeling bad."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just feel it in a very simple way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So the idea is to try to bring that kind of awareness to whatever you're feeling, whatever you're present for."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So even if you feel pain in your body, you want to see if you can bring that quality of attention to the pain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just a matter of fact, not being for or against it, just to feel it fully."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or if there's a lot of pleasure, same thing, you feel it fully but you're not for or against and you're leaning into it and say, ah, finally, now I'm really going to have a party here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If there's emotions that are compelling, then we would again let go of the breathing and turn ourselves to the emotions and do emotion mindfulness, mindfulness of the emotions, and in the way we talked about last week."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So the same is true of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That if thinking is in the background and not really disturbing anything, you can stay with your breathing in the foreground, you can just ignore your thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But when thinking comes into the foreground, becomes the predominant thing happening, or your lost in thought preoccupied with thinking, then the instructions are to let go of the breathing again and turn your attention to the thinking and be present for that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Hopefully in the same non-judgmental way or non-reactive way, not being for or against as you did for that neutral place that we felt in the beginning, the real key to mindfulness is the how you're mindful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so how you are is really important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you're not pushing, straining."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Some people have the sledgehammer approach to mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And they want to get rid of things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "They bring their mindfulness like a hammer, just kind of just bore down on it and zero in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Some people are lazy or complacent or afraid or resistant."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so they don't really think, well, I'm supposed to be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you kind of like just tap it lightly and turn the other way and kind of not really there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But the idea is to kind of bring this clear, present, relaxed awareness to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we can do that with our thinking as well."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just watch the thoughts go by, watch them there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And in this regard, it's very important not to think of the thoughts as problems, as something that's wrong or bad."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If you're a good meditator, you shouldn't be thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's very common for meditators to have those thoughts because thinking is the most common thing that distracts us from the meditation itself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if you feel like we're not succeeding at what the task at hand, what we set ourselves to do, many people have the habit of getting discouraged or disappointed or angry with themselves."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But in the mindfulness meditation, the idea is to just know what's happening in a very simple way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if what's happening is distracting, we just turn our attention to notice the distraction."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you're doing the practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So distractions are no longer the distractions as soon as you turn your attention to them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it's a wonderful piece of Aikido."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The very thing which is the problem becomes the, I don't know if we want to call it the solution, but the very things that's the challenge becomes the meditation itself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The challenge to meditation becomes the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So if there's loud sounds outside, I can't meditate because all the sound outside, my neighbor's dog is barking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we make that the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we just turn our attention to listen to barking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The barking is happening in the present moment, and we're trying to find a way to be relaxed and open with awareness, feeling that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "When these other things are no longer compelling, then the instructions are to come back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So if thoughts are compelling, you want to notice them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You want to bring your attention and look at them directly."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So what happened to some of you when we did that in this meditation? I instructed you to kind of stop focusing on the breathing and just completely look at thinking, and that's the only thing you were supposed to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "What happened to some of you? So there's a mic that we can bring to the outer hall there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yeah, so I found that naming the thoughts could help achieve that sort of detachment, remembering or judging, and the thought that really hooked me was planning, even visualizing whether I would volunteer this question or these thoughts right now and how I would go about that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I guess to make a question out of it, should I expect to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because the naming is sort of another layer of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So should I expect that in practice I might sort of stop this naming? You could."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so what he's referring to is, I think I mentioned it briefly in the earlier classes, that one of the techniques that supports mindfulness is naming the experience that you're having, so noting it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So if you're breathing, you can note in, out, in for the in breath, out for the out breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If you're having a strong sensation in your body, you can note that heat, heat, or pulling, pulling, or, you know, tight, tight, or something, itching, itching."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the idea of the noting is not so much."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The noting is not that important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's more, it does a couple of things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "One is it encourages you to stay present, stay there with that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like a little cheerleader says, stay there, stay with that, stay with the breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it also gives the thinking mind something very simple to do, because if an idle mind will get in trouble, it's so easy for it to wander off in something, you know, in more complicated thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you're giving the mind something very, very rudimentary kind of thought to keep you from drift."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's a thought that keeps you from drifting into thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it can be very helpful to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the other advantage sometimes of these mental notes is that it's also a fuller acknowledgement of what is it you're paying attention to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And there's something powerful in the mind about acknowledging something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like something settles, something gets freed up if we name it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That was a great thing that you did was with thinking you can note planning, remembering, and sometimes having that label can be freeing and help you not get onto that boat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like you step back from the shore and say remembering as opposed to getting on the boat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But you're supposed to monitor yourself, and there'll be a day you might find where it's no longer helpful to do that naming."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's the day you stop."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So I find this exercise much more difficult than in the past because I find it easier to just observe physical sensations or emotions even without getting engaged."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But to be present for thinking but not starting to engage in it, I find it very challenging."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And in a way it got me out of that kind of more relaxed, like, distance kind of space."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I think I might need a lot more practice in that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you're saying that it was too easy for you to get to thinking about thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it is a kind of a silent mind that we're watching the thinking with."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it takes a while to learn that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Someone else? Someone else? Just reacting on what you just said."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "How do you do that? Silent mind, noticing the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because for me, the awareness comes in a voice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But how do you know it comes in a voice? Because I hear it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But is the hearing silent? I don't know what to answer."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I know there are thoughts during meditation that are very much still identified with, which are the thoughts that keep me engaged in the breath, or correcting my posture."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that comes through some kind of voice that tells me to stay there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I don't have to go into that emotion point."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So there are different layers, there are different aspects of attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So some of them involve cognition, words."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And sometimes we only know something and we don't have a word for it, really."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But sometimes another layer of awareness is silent."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Where you don't have a word, you don't have a label for it at all."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You might hear a very strange sound, and you never heard it before, and you have no label for it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You might not think about what it is, it's just a sound."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or you're listening to music that's really nice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The richer the music, the quieter the mind can get."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if you start thinking about the notes, and you set the right note that the composer used, and maybe you should have been in a different beat, you kind of lose the music."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or if a wonderful car drives by here with a really good bass speaker, and our whole body begins vibrating, we can know and think about the vibration, and we can also feel it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that feeling is more silent."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so feeling is more silent than thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So there's a variety of different kind of silent awarenesses that operate that are kind of the foundation for mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That makes a lot of sense."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So for body feelings, or hearing something, or understanding this silent awareness, for thoughts, I don't know if I've ever experienced that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Have you ever listened to people speaking, speaking a language you didn't know? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you couldn't have any thoughts about what they were saying? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you might just kind of relax, you know, it can be in the background, but you're not trying to understand it, or judge it, or analyze it, it just becomes ambient sound."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can have the same relationship to your own thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There can be this images, or ideas, or words in the mind, and they can just be there, and be known in silence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So did some of you, when you turned your attention to your thinking, so in the earlier half of the meditation, you were supposed to let go of your thoughts and come back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And now in the second part, you were supposed to stop letting go, and just look at it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So now that you're allowed to think, that some of you found it hard to think, that it was like thoughts went away, but when you let go of it, they came back quickly? Isn't that interesting? That's a really important insight."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That sometimes if we're trying to get rid of thinking, and have a negative attitude towards it, it's the very thing that keeps it going."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or it can kind of create the conditions where it keeps flourishing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if you turn towards it directly, and acknowledge it, and see it for what it is, sometimes then it quiets down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Partly because seeing something doesn't fuel it, doesn't feed it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if you don't feed it, the thoughts don't continue making thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Those generate more and more thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So if you're sitting in meditation, and you start thinking, and it becomes a problem, in the sense that you have trouble being in the present moment, then you can just very relaxedly turn your attention and acknowledge thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It can be done silently if you know how to do that, if you can do that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or you can use a word, thinking, thinking, or remembering, planning, fantasy, whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that allows you to kind of be present to see it, watch the boat go by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It allows you to acknowledge it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "As I said, acknowledging is a powerful thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And you just keep in a very relaxed way, keep the noting going, the naming going, mostly for the purpose of to continue to kind of stay right there, be present for it as long as it's there strong."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then, if it stays, because it's really strong, then it's a time to investigate it, to get to know more about it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because a tendency for most people is to focus on the content of their thoughts, the story or the drama of their images, if they're thinking images."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And in mindfulness meditation, we like to say that the content is generally not very important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So we're actually going to do something different than most people habituated themselves to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We're allowing ourselves to think, but we're going to focus on other aspects of the thought besides the content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it's like listening to someone speaking a foreign language you don't know."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can't know what the content or what they're saying is, but you can pick up the tone of voice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can pick up the emotional mood that's in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can pick up how loud or soft the voices are."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can find out how fast they're speaking or how slow they're speaking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's all kinds of other aspects of the speech that you can be aware of besides the content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So the same thing is true for our thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We can become aware more than just the content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that becomes a more holistic awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's more open, taking in the full experience in a better way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's more difficult to get seduced by the content if you're able to take in the fuller experience of what's actually happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you might use very rudimentary kind of thinking and say, okay, now I know I'm thinking, let me try to feel more of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "What else is going on here? Am I thinking fast? Am I thinking slow? Is there a lot of energy in my thinking? So there might be some very, very simple thoughts that help you to connect and to see what's happening clearly."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Does that make sense? And so we make a distinction in meditation between discursive thinking and directed thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So discursive thoughts is when you tell ourselves a story, we're having a conversation, we're figuring out where you go on vacation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "A directed thinking in this regard is thinking that is directed towards being attentive to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's not like saying, oh, I'm thinking about my high school sweetheart who wasn't so sweet."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "In fact, she was kind of bitter."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And why do I keep choosing partners like that? And I must be something wrong with me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you're thinking about what's happening at present moment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You're thinking about your high school sweetheart, but you're analyzing and analyzing yourself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Whereas this directed thinking is very, very simple."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like, what does it feel like to be thinking this way? I keep thinking about certain things, but how does it feel for the body? Physically, what's it like when I keep thinking about this? Because if thinking is strong, you're going to feel it in the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "There's some place in the body where that thinking is usually as energized or it might be like people really think hard."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Their eyebrows go together and tight."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or they put their hands up in the mouth and they're thinking like, what's going on here? And there's a physical aspect that comes into play when we engage in thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so if you can feel the physicality of thinking, that gives you a way of being present for thinking without getting involved in the content, the story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Does that make sense? For me, when I really get involved in thinking a lot, I feel pressure or tension behind my forehead between my ears, kind of in my skull someplace."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And I call it my thinking muscle."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so then I'll relax that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Relax the thinking muscle."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when I relax that thinking muscle, then I'm less likely to think."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The other thing you can notice when there's a lot of thinking is incessant thinking tends to be fueled by emotions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it's almost as if emotions are the factory for persistent thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can look around and see what's the emotion that's connected to this kind of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So for example, planning, 90% of the time when people are planning a lot of meditation, they're anxious."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I like to think of the thoughts then as kind of like a flag that says, hey, you, over here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But it is not the flag you're supposed to pay attention to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you kind of drop down and feel the emotion out of which that's connected to the thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if the emotion gets taken care of and acknowledged and settled, then there's less need to think."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if you're anxious and you're planning, you can let go of your plans forever, and that anxiety is going to pump out more plans."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you have to keep letting go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if you can get to the factory and settle that, then it doesn't produce a lot more thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can feel the physicality of thinking and you can feel the emotionality of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's different than the content of what you're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so if the thinking is persistent, then you want to investigate or feel or be present for the emotion or the physical aspect of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so for the physical aspect, you're doing mindfulness of the body, which we talked about how to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just bring your attention to that part of your body and feel it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "For the emotional part of it, you're doing mindfulness of emotions and feel the emotions of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And generally, if you do that, it will settle down quickly and you can go back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Or if it continues, you're doing very worthwhile mindfulness on the realm of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It doesn't have to be a problem."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't have to judge it or feel like you're doing it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I'm not supposed to be thinking when I meditate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's fine to think when you meditate as long as you develop this clear awareness that, oh, I'm thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And one way to test yourself to see if you're really clearly aware that you're thinking is use the naming, but use the naming emphatically."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Thinking, I'm really thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's a way of kind of pulling yourself out of the world of thoughts onto that dry river bank and not be glued to the thought."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just pull back, pull back until you're free of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Is this making some sense? Now, it might sound complicated, all this, some saying."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The idea is to keep it really simple."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The idea is simply to be aware of what is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if what is is thinking, bring your attention to the thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "As you're aware of what's."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Shall thinking be aware of what's obvious around thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The physicality of it, the emotionality of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Just be there, be with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Be very attentive that you're not turning it into a problem."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I shouldn't be, it should be different or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when it finally settles or no longer compelling, no longer grabs you, then you can go back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Does that make sense? So, do you have any questions about that before we do our second meditation? Does that seem clear enough? It's kind of as it described again in the handout that's there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can read some of this again."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "What we're going to do now is not exactly a mindfulness meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's in the area of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But it's really meant to be a guided tour of what thinking is like for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "To look at thinking from many different angles."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So you can start getting a sense of the full experience you have of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And many people, you know, have never really noticed what this phenomenon of thinking is really about for them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It just kind of gets pulled into the content, the thoughts, the ideas, and get lost in them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So, take a meditation posture."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then gently close your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And take a few long, slow, deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "As you exhale, settling into your body, into your seat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then let your breathing return to normal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And take a minute or so just to hang out with your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Feeling being with your body, the breathing body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then as you're thinking, if you think, bring your awareness to it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But be mindful of the fact you're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Be aware that it's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if it goes away, just wait until it comes back."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And as you're thinking, do you tend to think more in words, or do you tend to think more in images? If you think in words, is there an inner voice that speaks them, or is there an inner book where their words are spelled out? And is there any sense of a location for where the words are spoken, or the speaker where they get projected from? It doesn't have to be, but is there a location for your thinking? Or if you think in images, is there some general or vague sense of a place or location for where those images appear? And as you think, what's the general amount of energy that you're even thinking? Is the thinking energetic and strong? Is it weak and soft? Does it feel tired? Does the thinking feel or seem alert and clear? Are there any emotions or moods or attitudes connected to your thinking? And if there is an emotion or a mood or an attitude, is there some place in your body where you tend to feel that state more than others? As you think, is there any pressure or tension or energy associated with your thinking somewhere in your body? As you're thinking, how strong is your interest in your thoughts? How strong is the attraction between you and your thoughts? Are you kind of glued to your thoughts or are the thoughts kind of in a distance? Awareness is free, it's kind of on the river bank, and you can just watch the thoughts go by."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Are there any gaps between your thoughts, any space between the end of one thought and the beginning of the next? If the next sentence makes sense for you, see if you can notice what goes on, what's present beyond the edges of your thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Do your thoughts fill the entire universe? Or are there parts of you and parts of the experience beyond the edges of what you're thinking? And then as you exhale, see if you can relax your thinking muscle."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Relax the tendency or drive to think."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And redirect your attention to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Feeling, sensing the body's experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And every time you exhale, letting go of your thoughts so you can let go into the body breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then you can take a few long, slow, deep breaths and really feel your body and feel yourself here in this room against the chair or your cushion."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And when you're ready, you can open your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So if the human body is a pyramid, then the bottom layer, bottom half, which provides stability to the pyramid, is the physical body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the next, almost the rest of the next half of the pyramid to the top, to the point, would be the emotions, the moods and attitudes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then the top little piece of the triangle, the top of the pyramid, where the dollar has a subtle eye, that would be the world of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If our being is placed with the base on the ground, solid and firm, then the whole pyramid is stable."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if you take the pyramid upside down and try to balance it on its point, the ability to keep it stable is very small and it will fall over pretty soon."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "If we lead our life with our thinking, then we have the pyramid upside down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And the world of thinking, surprisingly, is not a world of much stability."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if we lead with our body and really connect to our body, kind of live in our body, feel our body, be embodied as we go through life, then we have a stability, we have an anchor, where it's a lot more difficult to be pushed around and to fall over and lose our equanimity, lose our balance."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so to have the bodies in Buddhist meditation is really important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We're learning to be embodied as much as we're learning to be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Bodyfulness more than mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Bodyfulness means to be aware with your body and feel stable and grounded here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then the thoughts, they're just a small."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Thinking is kind of insecure, so we give it a good place in the top."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We'll take care of you, you get the good view."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But we tend to overvalue our thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Thinking is a very important part of life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it certainly deserves a lot of respect."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But the amount of time human beings tend to spend in thinking tends to be more than it deserves and more than it's helpful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And they get the right balance back of being kind of rooted in the body and then have thinking kind of supported by this firm body makes a whole different kind of life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So in that exercise we did, if I asked you the different questions about your thinking, was there anything that was useful for you to notice about yourself that you feel like you can share here? Anything that was helpful you think might have been helpful for you? I did not know that I thought in pictures."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Is it a little bit louder, please? I did not know that I thought in pictures."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Ah, so now that you know, how is that helpful, you think? I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So it's a big surprise? It was a big surprise."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So the advantage of knowing is that if you don't know, then it's kind of not really connected, not really seeing what's going on or where what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it's hard to be mindful in a clear way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But once you know you're thinking in the images, then it's easier to say, oh, there it is, I see it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I know it, I'm aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if you're clearly aware, then we tend to not be glued to it or caught entangled in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yes? I just noticed that I use both."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But with the picture, I could recognize that right away and go back to the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But the discursive thinking, I think, goes on for quite a while before I see it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Ah, so when you couldn't go back and you're talking out with it, what did you learn about it? I need to meditate more."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's just something to look at for now."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "A question which I didn't ask, which I usually do when I do this exercise, is ask people, what's the tone of the voice that's doing the inner thinking? There's a voice, what's the tone of the voice that's doing the inner thinking? Some people, like their eyes pop open and they go, I have no idea how harsh I am or how frightened it always is or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Sometimes people see in images, they have no idea that all the images were dark."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So anybody else that saw something or discovered something interesting for yourself? Yes, Kate over here on the stage."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Yeah, when you asked about where the voice or images were placed, I found it very strange that I thought about the narrator back here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "He was behind my head and then it kind of freaked me out a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Like it was God or something and it's not."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Did you ever see Wizard of Oz? You know, so it's like pulling the curtain more than seeing God."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Oh, it's a little guy back there, a little gal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And part of it, it's not so much, don't believe it's like a person there or some of your hearing voices, but rather it's by knowing a location, it's another way of kind of not being caught in its grip or being fooled by it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's like stepping, oh, there it is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I see it and then it can be there and I'm here and I'm free of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I don't have to take it so seriously, but we don't know where it is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Then it kind of has a way of meshing itself in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Then I guess they have this word, journalists who are embedded."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So then the thinking is embedded in us."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But if we can see where it is, we're no longer embedded and we're kind of a little bit distinct from it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Okay, so if some of you have this seem too complicated, all this in this exploration, just leave it here, forget about it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because it's supposed to be simple."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But it may be this kind of showed you a way to be mindful of thinking, hopefully in a simple way, that gives you a chance to connect to it, a bigger picture of what it is or more of what it is than just the content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Because that's the primary place that people tend to get entangled with their thinking or to get involved in it, get on the boat, is by paying attention to the content of what you're thinking about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And if you can see other aspects of the experience, then it's easier to be disentangled, pulled back, and let it kind of drift away or lose interest or see, this is not worth thinking about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I'm better off just being present with my breathing and I can do that later or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So next week was our last class."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "Hopefully it's to make it all simple and straightforward about how we do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "We'll do a guided meditation that covers all these different aspects."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then I'll talk about how we can bring this into our daily life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's very, very rewarding to bring what we're learning in meditation about how to be present into the rest of our life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "In fact, in some ways, that's the whole point of all this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "It's not just a sit and becomes peaceful and calm, but be able to bring some of the higher quality of how to be present into our life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "The line between meditation and not meditation is an arbitrary line."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "So at some point, it's very nice to be interested in extending this out into our life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "And then I'll also talk about how to go deeper into the practice, ways of going deeper into the mindfulness, and how the deeper realms of mindfulness gives birth to wisdom, and how wisdom becomes part of this whole mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "I hope that this whole mindfulness of thinking, with time, some of you might take a while, that in good time, you'll become friends with your thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "That they're not your enemy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But they become your good friend."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You can drop them if you don't need them, or you can let go of them if they're not being helpful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "You're kind of a mastery over them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "But really, you become a friendly relationship between you and your thoughts, and your thoughts and you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 4: Mindfulness of Thoughts", "completion": "May your thoughts become your friends."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "For this week, we'll do seven days of this 7 am  morning sitting and go through Saturday and Sunday as well because on this weekend, starting Thursday evening, we're reaching a retreat and so just fold in this 7 am  sitting into the retreat, the retreat into this sitting."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So there's a kind of a multi-faceted theme for this week."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so I'll introduce it this way, that the meditation practice that we do, the core of it is called Insight Meditation."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And that's a translation of vipassana."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And vipassana means to see clearly or to see with emphasis."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And in the ancient texts, vipassana is not a meditation practice, but rather it's a result of meditation practice in the form of insight."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "As we develop and cultivate meditation, then at some point there is a revelation that happens."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And I use the word revelation because we don't have the sense that we're probing or doing the analysis, which is just seeing what's there and allowing what's there to show itself in a deep way."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And there are three insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And those are deep insight into impermanence or inconstancy, a deep insight into suffering, a deep insight into not-self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So that's kind of one piece of a larger process of practice."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And the idea is to get there to have these deep insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "To get to those insights, meditation practice is to cultivate ourselves, develop ourselves in meditation in such a way that we can have those insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so we don't do the insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "The insights just happen as we are well stable, focused and clear."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so how do we cultivate ourselves? Well, maybe a little bit paradoxically, we cultivate the opposite of the three characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "We cultivate stability and stillness so that we can see impermanence and change and inconstancy really well."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "We cultivate happiness and well-being, as we talked about last week, so that we can have the capacity to really have deep insight, the capacity to really be able to look at suffering, be with suffering in a very deep way without it being a negative experience."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then we cultivate something that can be called in English, something like self-confidence, efficacy, and the sense of strong confidence, self-confidence, that allows us to see what is called not-self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So that's what we cultivate."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Now, why do we cultivate these days? We cultivate these to have the insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And why do we cultivate the insights? We have the insights in order to bring the mind to a place, to a time where the mind has no fixations."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "It's not fixating on wanting something or resisting anything or fixating on desires or versions, fixated on delusions and ideas and fears."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And often the mind is fixated."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "It's kind of focused about something and really is stuck there once that or is that, in ways that we don't really begin to see until we start calming and settling the mind deeper and deeper and deeper."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Then at some point we'll notice that the mind keeps being preoccupied."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "There's a tension, a momentum, a holding pattern in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And some of this is really almost below the level of thinking and the very kind of attachment or fixation to being alive or being a self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Even things like being safe or having opinions or holding onto stories."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And there's nothing necessarily wrong with those things, but there's no freedom with the mind fixated."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So the purpose of seeing these deep insights into inconstancy, suffering and not self is so the mind can release its fixations."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And to do that very deeply brings the mind to something that the Buddhist tradition calls the three doors of liberation."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And those three doors are the doors that lead to the mind letting go in a deep way, letting go of its deepest fixations, so liberation, awakening."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And those three doors are the doors, and I'll explain this, the doors of the signless, the door of the wishless and the door of emptiness."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So the signless is the door where we no longer fixate on any of the projections we have on reality around us."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And certainly the more abstract or complicated projections we have about people and bias and prejudice and judgments we have."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "But also the simplest projections, even the projection on something like a door that it's a door or a chair that it's a chair."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "In the way chairs function in our society, it's a completely appropriate and some degree accurate idea that we apply to this piece of furniture that we call a chair."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "But if you brought that to people 50,000 years ago on this planet, those people maybe wouldn't know it was a chair."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "They wouldn't be unsure of what it was."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Maybe they thought it was a stepping stool to get up to the fruit and the tree."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "They wouldn't occur to them maybe that it was a chair."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So even the simplest forms of attributing concepts to things can be a fixation."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so when the mind is no longer projecting anything, that's called the signless, and they get the mind to the point where it's relaxed and still enough, open enough, safe enough, peaceful enough, that it's not making any projections on anything at all, then something can release."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And there's something about seeing in constancy, in permanence, that we realize that the more we see things constantly changing, the more we see they don't fit."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "The projections don't quite work."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so the projecting mind can finally release or relax."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "The wishless is when we experience suffering."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "We see that the unsatisfactory nature, the degree of stress or tension that somehow inherent in so many things, even the smallest movements of the mind, surprisingly, to really see that and see that from a place of happiness, but to really see it."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Then the ways in which we get fixated on the pursuit of happiness or fixated on our suffering releases."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then something very deep can let go."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then to really see something about how things are not self, the not-self characteristic of phenomena, and I'll talk more about that later."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "But that is the, I think it's fair, and most people understand how much fixation human beings have on themselves, on self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "There starts to have a lot of self-confidence to cultivate that, so that there's enough health confidence one can begin to let go of the fixation on self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And when that is, the mind stops that fixation for some people, that's the door they step through for deeper liberation."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so that's liberation, so there's what we cultivate, there's what we see, and there's the doors to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then that's followed, but then how we live in the world."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And each of these three doors can open to a different benefit for living in a good, wonderful way in the world."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "But for now, I want to say that there are these, so there's four different kind of steps in this larger process."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And that could be summarized in a little ditty, a little kind of saying."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "First you be, then you see, next you free, finally you are we."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So first you be, you become someone who's stable, has sense of well-being, and confidence."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "First you be, then you see, you see the three insights of inconstancy, suffering, and not-self."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Then you free, you step through the doors of liberation, the mind saddles very deeply, the doors of sinless, wishless, and emptiness, and then you're we."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Then the solid barrier, solid walls between self and other dissolve, and the concern and care and love for the whole world becomes much more natural and part of an expression of that freedom that comes."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "Because how could there be freedom without that freedom opening us up to care about the world around us? So that's the kind of overarching overview of what, some of what will happen this week."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then I will, and some of this will happen at the retreat, and I'll arrange to have those talks also posted together with this series."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So that those of you who want to have easy access to the whole thing, or some of these retreat talks will happen, not during the 7 am  sitting."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And so if you want the whole package, it'll be easily accessible for you in other ways."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And I'll talk more about that later."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So I hope that this is nice for you."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And in these first days of this week, I will talk mostly about the three doors of liberation."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So in a sense, we're starting with the advanced teaching as the background, as the direction we're going in practice."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "And then for the retreat, I'm going to talk about the cultivation, the being, what we develop, and the insights."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So, oh, somebody asked a question, sinless or sightless? Sinless, no signs."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So no projections of concepts, ideas is what the sinless is."}
{"prompt": "Be, See, Free, We (1 of 10) Doors of Liberation", "completion": "So I look forward to continuing this theme over the next days."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So yesterday we started a new set of explorations, a new set of invitations to explore with respect to meta."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "We started with the eight-fold path to explore the relationship between meta and each of the factors, path factors."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "And yesterday we started with wise perspective, sometimes translated as right view, like wise perspective more."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "And the second path factor on the eight-fold noble path is wise intention, wise intention."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "And intention is the precursor to the next few factors with wise action and speech and livelihood and will be coming."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "But intention is really the seed, the root, the, as it's expressed, as is taught really fundamentally in Buddhism on our intention rests the fruit of our actions or karma, if you like to, if we want to think of it that way."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "The fruits, the results of our actions really rests on the intention, what the intention is."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So intention has a very central place in the teachings in Buddhism, what our intention is."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "And I found in my own practice checking in with my intention to be a profound practice, to be a profound daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "For example, pausing when I'm writing an email what is my intention? Especially before getting sent, what am I trying to accomplish in the world? What is my intention in doing this? And what seeds am I planting? What seeds am I planting? As I'm having thoughts or I'm having, even if I'm distracted in the narrative, I pause sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "What seeds am I planting? What is my intention here in engaging in this? Of course, not intentionally, but that really stops me in my tracks to really come back to my intention, not just in activities, in actions in the world, but also in actions of the mind, actions of the mind and heart, which are actions too, in a way, even if they're not perceived externally."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So, tonight's this morning, this moment, exploration, the invitation is to explore our relationship with our intention and metta, the practice of cultivating loving-kindness, goodwill for ourselves and others."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Many things we can notice in this journey."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "One is that as we intend, as we set the intention for goodwill for ourselves and others, how the landing, the planting of that seed of intention, how it helps metta flower, not just in our practice, but in our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "As I mentioned in the way of, in our daily lives, with a reflection, what am I planting here? What seed am I planting here? Is it a seed of metta, goodwill? Is it a seed of ill-will I'm actually planting for myself or for others? So, relating really that contemplation about the intention to the seed you're planting and the defruits, that will be resulting."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "And vice versa, as we cultivate, as we cultivate metta, goodwill, friendliness, love, we'll see that it strengthens our intentionality."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "It strengthens the sense of alignment with our true values, with our true intentions in the world."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "We can access them more easily, more readily."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "They'll become more easily available without us living too far from them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So, by cultivating goodwill and friendliness and acting out of it, we'll be closer, we'll be living closer to our true intentions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "The way we really want to live our life, even though every moment it may not show up that way, but we can become more aligned with our true intentions in the way we want to show up in this human life, in this limited, precious, impermanent gift that is our human life."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So, with that, let's embark on our journey together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "So, I'd like to invite you to the entire meditation posture, whatever might be supportive to you in this moment, sitting maybe upright a little more or relaxing the body more, maybe lying down for each and every one of us might be different in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "What is supportive? What posture? And connecting with your intention in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Let's start with the intention."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Ah! Maybe dropping in the inquiry."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "What is my intention? For this period of practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Dropping in the question into your body, not into your head."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Dropping this question, letting your body reverberate and see what answer comes up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "You might be surprised as to what comes up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Embracing, allowing whatever is arising, whatever reverberation, or maybe nothing comes up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "I just want to sit and be guided, that's fine too."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Metta and Wise Intention", "completion": "Whatever comes up or doesn't come up."}

{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So that had a formative impact on me, this possibility of nuclear holocaust in the 1960s that we had."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "My grandparents went through."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "They were young, but they went through World War II."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "My grandparents went through it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Parents-in-law went through it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Some of them are very difficult circumstances, some of them are most difficult."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I grew up with lots of stories of war."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I always felt like war was close by."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So we have not just the war in the Ukraine, but that's the most."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's always the most dramatic for us, but there are other wars in the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "People are busy and engaged or kind of overwhelmed by local wars that they probably don't even know what's going on in Ukraine, because they're just dealing with their own."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And it seems that war is a phenomenon of hatred and competition, greed, power, which doesn't bring out the best in human beings."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And the sad thing is when the war brings out the worst in human beings, people otherwise would have been nice."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And it just perpetuates awful ways in which people are together."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think coming out of these years, many years, decades now of doing Buddhist practice, I have a strong sense that the world that I live in begins with me."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't think it's a conceited sense that begins with me like that, but where else would it start? Through my experience, the way that I have contact with, through my senses with the world around me, reading and learning about things far away."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And so in my consciousness, it radiates from here that contact with the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And the way that I perceive the world is not an indifferent bystander, or innocent bystander, just seeing it as it actually is."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The way we experience and see the world is very much connected to how we, the eyes through which we see the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And if we see the world through eyes of anger, we see it one way."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If we see it through the eyes of kindness, it's another way."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If we see it through the eyes of greed, it's one way."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If we see it through the eyes of generosity, we see a different world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "We attune to different experiences, to different sights, and sights, and sounds, and different things we notice."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The studies of people who were actually encouraged to be kind, and when they were encouraged to be kind, they saw more kindness throughout the day, and more opportunities for kindness."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But when they weren't told that, the controlled group, that wasn't told anything about kindness, they noticed fewer, less kindness in the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And so if the world begins with us, then what do we offer this world? And I feel very strongly that if we want to live in the world that's peaceful, don't be expecting other people to make the peace."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If you want to live in the world where you want a peaceful world, be peaceful yourself."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Be saving the world, save the world, but begin with you."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Don't look elsewhere for it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "For one thing, that means that if you look elsewhere, someone else to do it, then you're not engaged."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And it's a kind of despairing not to engage."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It kind of makes us discouraged and gives up our agency, and then we get disappointed when other people don't behave the way they're supposed to or are not successful."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's just so good for the human heart to be active, to be engaged, making a difference."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It doesn't matter how big it is."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Chances are none of us here today are going to stop the war in Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But maybe we can help a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You probably know, but IMC this week has a fundraising drive for money to save the children and one of the highest-rated charities to help them and their work with their refugees, Ukrainian refugees."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So that's something we can do."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think this morning we've raised $43,000."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's a drop in the bucket for the billions that are needed."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And for the kids in the refugee camps who don't have water or don't have food or blankets or something, I don't know what their needs are."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "That's a pretty big deal for them."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So to do, to engage, and it's kind of one of the, it's remarkable we don't do more of it this way because it turns out it's good for the heart, it's good for us to be kind, to be generous."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "There's been studies done on kindness."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's kind of phenomenal, right? Finally, I think they did studies on anger first, but now slowly they're getting to these more positive emotions and studying them."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So one of the things people, researchers say is what many of us already know, that if you're kind, you can feel good for the other person, but it can feel good for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The other day I took a taxi."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And the taxi driver was not a good driver."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The taxi driver wasn't particularly pleasant to be with."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And at some point I was talking a lot in a way that was just not so pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Also, I didn't wear his mask, except under a chin."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I thought that's kind of strange still, it's time of day, this kind of time."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I didn't quite know where he was going exactly."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I did kind of tell him where to go."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So it was a little unusual."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But when we got to a place where I was going, I just felt delighted to be able to give him a big tip."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The big tip was not like, oh, you did a good job."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It was like, oh, you're a human, my tip was you're a human being who's struggling in life, trying to make life get by."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I felt that I got a sense from this as a man who things weren't easy."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I said, oh, you're a human being who's trying to get by and struggling."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I don't know why the pandemic's been hard for him."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I just wanted to kind of, I just felt kind of cozy and friendly and kind."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And he was quite surprised to get a nice tip."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I was, then I was happy again."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It felt nice to have that kind of instinct of generosity."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But when he reacted so like, wow, it wasn't, you know, that big."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But, you know, it wasn't putting his kids through college or anything."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But, you know, just like, oh, he felt, you know, he kind of lit up."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I just cheered him up a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Did he deserve a tip, big tip? And that was not how I was thinking."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "That kind of way of thinking was maybe if he'd done like an extra mile that did something really special, something maybe I would have done the same or more or something."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But my generosity was not contingent upon him deserving it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It was contingent upon here's a person who it can make a difference in this person's life and to care for him and express some kind of goodness and kindness and do it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I kind of felt kind of cozy in my heart."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I didn't think about it again until I was thinking about giving a talk on kindness today."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I remembered the other day."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It was a surprise the way that being kind or compassionate or caring can produce some very good feelings in the person who's kind."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't know if it's automatic, but I think that it works best to be kind if we feel confident and safe and comfortable with the situation."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And if that's the case, then I think kindness creates a kind of mood or goodness or warmth or softness in ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If we do it in a nice way, if we're kind in a kind way, that's good for us."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I remember the first time I really felt this in a strong way was I was in a kind of hike in a desert kind of area with a group of people."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think it was a lead group, but it was a little bit difficult because somebody had to climb over these little boulders and through these little valleys that had ledges yet to get up and over."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And there was a person on the hike who had trouble with that."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So I just kind of stayed behind to help this person up the ledges and over the boulders."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I didn't think much about doing it, just seemed like a thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But then after a while, I started feeling how good it felt."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I started feeling so good inside, and I couldn't wait until there was the next ledge."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And after a while, who was benefiting who here? Was I helping her? Was she helping me? Was I the one who was fortunate to be helping because it's such a good thing to me? Or was she the one who was fortunate to be helped? I don't know exactly how she felt by it, but I felt pretty cool, pretty amazing that if you want to be happy, one of the ways to be happy is to help other people, be kind to other people, generous to other people."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If you don't want to be happy, then it's recommended you don't be kind to anyone."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You'd mess up with your lack of happiness if you start being kind."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But the fact that we can be kind, and it does good things for us, and that it's self-perpetuating, once we start being kind, we start seeing the world through those eyes."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "We start seeing the world through those softness and that orientation."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And we start seeing more kindness in the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "People do a lot of good things for each other."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Small things and big things."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And so you start seeing it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "They start living in a world that's not only the horrific things we're seeing and reading about in the Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You don't want to deny it and pretend it's not there."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But that's not the whole story."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Even in the Ukraine, there is a lot of people who are trying to help."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "A lot of organizations who are rushing with their work and their money to provide for the refugees."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "A lot of people who are there going to help the people who are wounded."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You can see sometimes horrific pictures of someone being helped out of a building that's been bombed and there's blood on their face."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And it's kind of horrific to see."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But then do you notice the person who's helping them? Has their arm around their shoulders and leading them out? That's pretty phenomenal that people are doing that."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "In some ways it's more dramatic, it's probably dangerous to help in that way."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But the helpers are the people who are making the world a good place to live in."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The kind of world that we want to live in."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So one of the principles I like to live by is I want to be, live my life as if I'm living in the world I want to be in."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So what I mean by that, I want to live in a world where people are kind to each other and supportive and generous and caring."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And that world begins with me being that way, being kind and generous and supportive."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I want to live in it so much, that world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I prefer that or the value of that."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't want to live in a world of violence."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But I don't want to turn my back on the violence and pretend it's not there."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't want to be the ostrich putting my hand in the sand and ignoring it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But I don't want to succumb to that, to anger, succumb to despair, succumb to greed, succumb to violence."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't want that to come out of me into the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't want that to be the influence I have on this world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I don't want to live in a world that's like that."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I would like to suggest that that sometimes takes a tremendous amount of bravery to do that."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "People who go to war to fight are said to be brave."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Sometimes they risk it for great causes."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "What about risking our lives for the sake of kindness? What about risking our lives for the sake of peace? Is it worth? Is it appropriate? Is that worthwhile to have that kind of bravery as well? To have such a high value on love and care? That if we want to be a world like that, maybe we do have to sacrifice some things."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Is it then foolish even to put our lives in danger? Going out into the battlefield to bring back the injured? To stand in front of the tanks so that they don't bump some people? I don't think that kindness is avoiding."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "To live dedicated to kindness or love or care or generosity."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think to really do it realistically for this world that's so horrific."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "We almost need like a kindness core."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "People who are so dedicated to it that they're willing to really give themselves over to it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And perhaps even risk their lives with it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So it isn't just, well, okay, that's good."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I'll be kind to my cat now when I go home."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's nice to be kind to your cat, but I think if we want the world to start with us, and how we are is what creates the world to some degree."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Do we have the bravery to hold on to the values that we would like to have in this world? To experience this world too."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If you want to live in a world of peace, and you're contributing to it, how brave do you need to be? If society struggles with some of the difficulties, effects of the war, I mean some of the rising gas prices and energy prices, do we just complain? Do we have to be brave and wise and clever on how to not use so much gasoline rather than being complained about the gasoline prices? Do we find people to give them money so they can give them gasoline, people who need it more than we do? How do we live in a world, how do we make the world the world that we want to live in? That I think is one of the principles that I've learned from Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And one of the reasons, one of the ways that's represented in the teachings of the Buddha, is that with the word world in his language, it's L-O-K-A, Loka, has the same varied meanings as the English word world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It can mean the earth kind of, but you can also say the world of my senses, just what I'm aware of in the moment, or the world of my emotions."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And for the Buddha, the word L-O-K-A sometimes just means the direct world of your immediate experience here in this body."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But also the globe is the world as well."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And here we have the same word used for both."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I think that there's something very profound about this, that they're not so separate."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And so it is from this kind of idea that if you want to live in a kind world, a supportive world, a caring world, well, there's a world in which you can do that, which is your world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And your world is connected to that wider world, spreads from you."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Who knows who you'll touch, who knows where it'll take you."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So what I'd like to propose to you all is that if you are despairing about what's happening in the world, if you are angry with what's happening in the world, and you spend a lot of time in despair and anger, you're wasting your time."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's a kind of an indulging."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's reasonable that we feel these, that sort of stuff."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But it's also possible to act differently."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's possible to do and act, so that what the world needs, what you feel the world needs, comes from you out into the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And it makes a huge difference for your heart."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If you're only reading the news, that's all you do."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You know, that's not good for the heart."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The Buddha taught action in a way that sometimes is not so obvious when we're teaching Buddhism through a meditation tradition, where come and meditate and be quiet."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But the teaching was really about action."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "The world begins with your action."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Every day when you wake up, you create a new world for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "What's that world that you want to create? And each of us is capable of agency."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Each of us is capable, even if it's small things, saying hello to a neighbor, picking up a trash someplace where no one's picked it up for a while."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I have a friend, one of her things, she goes periodically on the weekend down around, I don't know exactly downtown River City, but somehow east of El Camino."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And she collects trash from the train tracks and other places."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "All kinds of things that are possible."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Now, if you're not despairing and not angry, maybe that's a different."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But if you are despairing and angry, I think it would probably do you a world of good if you acted in the ways that create the world that you want to live in."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "In the ways that are good for your heart."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Feed it and support it and nourish it so that you benefit from the goodness that you do."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "There's this wonderful mutuality that we do good for the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "If you do it the right way, then we benefit from it."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's almost like we should all be selfish in this kind of way because in this very particular way, to want our hearts to be radiant and glowing and warm and loving, what a great way to be."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And if you could be selfish around that, boy, would you do good in the world."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And you wouldn't be able to stay selfish for very long because selfishness limits the glow of the heart."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So you're welcome to start selfishly."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It's okay because it'll melt away if what you're doing is benefiting yourself from love with love, care, kindness."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So I would say the world needs kindness now more than any time that it's needed in my lifetime that I've known."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "This is the great need we have."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "There probably is no hope for us unless we have people who care and act on that care, who love and act on that love."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "So I hope that this practice that we do, our meditation practice or mindfulness practice, I hope that's a support for you to empower you, to cleanse you of what gets in the way of your love and empowers you to act on that, your kindness, your goodness."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And so those are my thoughts for today."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Any of you have any thoughts you want to share about this topic? Yeah, I can use the mic."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I see that something funny happened with the people on YouTube and I look like one of those mirrors in the amusement parks."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think it's a problem with our software here."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I had an occasion earlier today where I was doing something, helping the community."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And this isn't about me and like what I was doing, but there's a lot of rote doing something over and over again where my body kind of gets tired."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But there's a larger community that I can interface with and be with."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But while I was just mindfully just doing something over and over and over again to do something that was a good cause, my brain came up with a song I haven't sung in decades."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It kind of had a headache."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Rotator cuff was bugging me."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But this spontaneously song just came up that I haven't sung truly in decades."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I don't know where it came from."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But there was just this upwelling of a song."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "One of my ideas of reference points for being happy is having our heart sing."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "What makes your heart sing? And so to live that way, I guess your heart starts singing."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "Yeah, no, something different."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "It was like, wow, where did that come from? Beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "In my neighborhood, there is some very strange thing happened."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I was going for a walk and then I see the pile of flowers by the wall."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And there is a teddy bear."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "You can hold it like this."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And there is a teddy bear and I have no clue what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And then a few days later, somebody told me that it is for the homeless guy."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And I asked the lady, what's homeless? But we literally had only one homeless guy hanging around the neighborhood."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I gave him sometimes money."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But I never seen him interacting with anybody, talking with anybody."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But you see, person dies and people's hearts open to him."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "People brought him flowers."}

{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "We're harried and busy and trying to do too much."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And the question is, what's the most valuable way to be? Again, it's kind of the theme of the talk."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "I think one of the most valuable things to waste to be is to be the world that you want to live in."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "And if you want to be in a world where you're running after your to-do list, trying to do as much as you possibly can through the day and just being harried and busy, well, that's the world you want, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "There's a lot of people around here who can help you do it well."}
{"prompt": "Kindness Makes a New World", "completion": "But I don't think that's the world we want to live in."}

{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So, for many years I've been teaching an intro to mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I started in 1990 when I first started, or so, in 1991 perhaps, the first intro class in Palo Alto."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I've never taken an intro to meditation class when I gave one."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I've been introduced to vipassana meditation in Southeast Asia."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And they didn't do intro classes there."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "They just, you know, in about 20 minutes told you what the practice was and then sent you to do it for eight months in a room or something."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And you kind of learned more as you went along."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But the idea of a gradual class over five weeks as I did it was something that was, you know, I'd never experienced."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But when I started teaching here in California, my colleagues, Jack Hornfield who was training me, they had already had institutionalized the system of offering a six-week introductory course."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So I figured, well, I was supposed to be a teacher and I should do that too."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But I'd never taken one of those courses."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I thought six weeks was way too long so I made it five weeks."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I found out some years later that my other friends and colleagues, they made it up differently."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so some of you have gone to my intro class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I enjoy doing it a lot."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "My enjoyment in doing intro classes keeps growing the longer I do it and I look forward to doing it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I was a little bit reluctant to only do it twice this year."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But I wanted to also be able to teach other things."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I wanted to teach other kind of introductory classes kind of in the same spirit, in the same way in which I do the intro to meditation class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as I thought of this class, introduction to the fundamentals of Buddhist life, Buddhist spiritual life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it's meant kind of as a real basic class, a beginner's kind of class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Some of you, I wonder why you're here."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it really meant as a basic introductory class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I've never taken a class introduction to the fundamentals of Buddhist spiritual life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as far as I know, none of my colleagues ever taught this kind of class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So it's something new for me to teach."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as I thought about it, I thought of a lot of different ways to approach the fundamentals of Buddhism, the foundations of Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And sometimes in my mind, we just go in all directions and I say, well, I have a cat that teach this and that and this and that and that."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then we have a two-year class just to get through the fundamentals."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But one of the beautiful things about the Dharma is that the different elements of Dharma practice, the spiritual life, overlap, interrelate, contain each other."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But you could actually just pick up one element and many of the others would follow its way or follow in it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And some people have pointed out that just practicing ethics, the precepts, is a very powerful practice and brings along with it all kinds of wonderful qualities and develops spiritual life just in doing focusing on ethics."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It could be argued that just doing mindfulness practice is all you need to do and everything else will follow."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I think that in order for the."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Mindfulness is very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I believe everything you need will mostly follow along if you're very diligent and careful with your mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But there's much more to a Buddhist life than just being mindful."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And sometimes I feel a little bit sad when I get the impression from some of the people that I teach that all they're allowed to do in their spiritual life is be mindful, non-reactive awareness of what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And a very spiritual life is much broader than just presence, non-reactive awareness."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And in the Buddhist tradition, there's many factors which are considered to be supportive of mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so you get these foundations in place first before you do mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "A friend of mine many years ago, a woman from Taiwan who had come to America as an adult."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "He was raised as a Buddhist and was studying doctoral studies of Buddhist studies at Stanford."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And she was quite serious about Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "She had a Buddhist teacher and devoting her life to it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I asked her if she meditated."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I assumed that pretty much anybody that serious about Buddhism would meditate."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And her answer surprised me."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And she said, no, not yet."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I'm working on myself so that I'm worthy enough to meditate."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Isn't that something? So she had kind of a classic Asian idea of Buddhism that you don't just kind of put yourself into meditation cold, but you actually prepare yourself for that by doing other things first and creating a really good foundation for meditation."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So some of the other elements of Buddhism are their supports for mindfulness practice itself that makes it go become stronger, mature better in a healthier, safer way."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But a spiritual life in the Buddhist terms is much more than just being mindful."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It involves a whole orientation of how we live in the world."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that orientation then informs Buddhists in all their choices and how they live their lives, the choices of including things like what kind of work they do, how their activities in the world and their purchases perhaps, what they buy and what they don't buy, and how they relate to neighbors and community and to nature around them."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "There's a tremendous amount of, you know, Buddhist life is not just meditation."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's about how we live our life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I would suggest that since the title of this is a Buddhist life, many people are trying to look at how to put some Buddhism into their life, how to, you know, sprinkle some mindfulness practice, sprinkle some good things in Buddhism to improve their life and all that."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I'm very happy to offer Buddhist practice as a spicing in people's lives or the little medicine in their lives that helps them."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But, you know, it's kind of like adapting Buddhism for your life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And there's a whole other approach which is to adapt your life to Buddhism and live a Buddhist life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that's possible to do that."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And some people will do it to greater or lesser degrees."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I'm not here to tell you what you should be doing or I don't really have any expectation of what you're supposed to be doing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But I thought it'd be nice to offer this kind of class and give you at least my take on what I think is the foundations."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then you can pick up and do with that what you'd like."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And since you showed up, you know, it's a self-selecting audience, right? I don't have to worry about trying to, you know, I'm not propagating here or anything."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I'm just talking to people who seem to want to come to this."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So, what we'll do in these five weeks is much like the way we do for the Intro to Meditation class, Mindfulness class, is go through elements of Buddhist practice which build on each other, support each other."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And just like in Mindfulness class, if you get a good sense of how to work with a breath, it's easier to work with a body."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you have a good sense of how to work with a body, it's easier to work with emotions."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you have a good sense of how to work with emotions, it's easier to work with your mental life and thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And if you have a good sense of how to work with your thoughts and mental life, it's a lot easier to apply the practice in your daily life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So, in the same way this class is built on things that build on each other."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So, today I'm going to talk about the basic ideas of the orientation of a Buddhist life and the intention, the idea of orientation and intention."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then that will be a support for next week when we talk about some of the, what can in short time be called to the ethical issues of Buddhism, but I prefer to call them the relational, that aspect of our life where we try to live wisely in relationship to others."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that has to do with ethics and it has to do with generosity."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "The third week will build on that and it will be a little bit more that relational aspect of life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And this will be the aspect of love, the Buddhist take on love, which it has to do also with relationship with others and the world around us."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And the following week we'll talk about the idea of what's called in Buddhism, cultivation, developing oneself."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "That a Buddhist life is one that's concerned with developing oneself in various ways, improving one's, developing one's mind, one's heart."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then the final week we'll talk about, after we talk about developing, we'll talk about letting go."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And letting go is also a very important part of the path."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And letting go is that which ultimately will lead to the fruition of the Buddhist life, which is liberation."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "There are many different models or ideas of what a spiritual path is about."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You find many of them just in Buddhism itself."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And sometimes people are at odds with each other which path is better, which one is the highest truth and which one is false or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I'm actually not so interested in comparing that way, different paths."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I kind of take it as a tenant that all paths, all kind of ways of practicing are valid for different people at different times."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so they all point to something that's very important."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I'm actually more interested in how they all can be seen as being in harmony with each other rather than how they can be opposed to each other."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So if you come with your own notions and ideas of a spiritual life and a path from some other tradition or other Buddhist tradition or your own inclinations, you might carry that with you as a principle, you might explore it during these weeks, is rather than being in opposition to what I'm saying, see if you can find some way to incorporate it, to assimilate it, or use it to support maybe the way you understand things or how you'd like to understand things."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "The particular idea of a Buddhist life or spiritual life by the Buddha could be to understand as being a developmental model of the path or developmental model of life that is very much in harmony with or goes along with the idea of human development in a rough sense."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "In the sense that you look at a child and how a child grows up, many of us are concerned with how children grow and we teach them, we teach them academics, we teach them values, we teach them all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as the children grow, both because of the way they're taught and because of the environment and because of internal things, biological things that the child has themselves, they develop, they grow."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And you can see stages of children developing over time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it will be foolish to not notice and be wise about the development of children over time and somehow incorporate that into our relationship to children and support the development of children over time and how they develop."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So when a person becomes an adult in a normal healthy environment, that's kind of when the Buddhist path would begin."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then that developmental trajectory continues."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's just a normal kind of almost biological thing that happens just like biologically whatever children develop over time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So once we become an adult, we're not fixed beings anymore, you become a fixed thing, but we're still capable of continued development."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I would suggest that in a healthy environment that probably we would all develop quite beautifully through our adult years."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And probably some of you can recognize changes in yourself in your adult years."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Things that values you had or concerns you had or difficulties you had earlier in life as an adult are no longer here now."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You see things differently because of the stage of life you're in."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So the Buddha saw the spiritual life in developmental terms and that things can change and cultivate and develop with time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that that development has certain patterns, certain laws that the Buddha I think would say was universal."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so he would then lay down the spiritual life as a path of gradual cultivation and development."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "What that implies is that Buddhists are phenomenally patient."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Buddhists are not into instant gratification, but rather kind of like good adults."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "They think that if you want something, it takes a while to get it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It takes a while to develop certain skills, develop certain qualities, understandings."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And just like if you want to go and develop your body by going to a local gym, you don't expect to go to the gym and lift up a couple of barbells and then go home and that's it, instant enlightenment and instant strength and that's it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But it takes a while to develop yourself and you need to have certain attitudes and approaches and discipline to developing your body by going to the gym."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Consistency of wise approach to what you do, of patience, whole bunch of attitudes that you need to have if you're not going to suffer while you do it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So the same thing in doing a Buddhist spiritual life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It takes a wise attitude, a wise understanding, it takes patience."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it takes a sense that we're actually kind of, that there's a goal or direction, directionality in that development."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Now the Buddha said that the Dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And how I understand that is that Dharma practice, the Dharma life, is meant to be good at its inception, it's meant to be good in the middle of doing it and it's meant to be good at the fruition of it, the end of it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "That is supposed to be a good thing, it's supposed to be a beneficial thing and it's meant to be something that brings happiness."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Happiness is one of the keys to the Buddhist spiritual life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's about developing happiness of different kinds."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's about understanding the nature of happiness, understanding how to develop it, understanding how to support it and understanding how it can be a healthy goal for our lives to develop our capacity to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Happiness is a really important part of what we're going to talk about in these five weeks."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And hopefully as we talk about these different elements of the fundamentals, either through what I say, hopefully, or through your own understanding, you will be able to connect these different elements to how these things support your capacity to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that you hopefully, after five weeks, become a happier person."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "That would be great, wouldn't it? It would make me very happy."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And maybe it will just be little increments."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "We don't do instant gratification here."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But that's kind of like the name of the game."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You're not supposed to become a grim Buddhist, or bear down or go around kind of with a flag of suffering and say, I'm a Buddhist, I look at suffering and life is suffering and this isn't terrible."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And you're not supposed to be really serious about your Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "One of the things that kills the Buddhist spiritual life is excessive seriousness."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So I remember once telling my Zen teacher, you know, I'm not very serious about this Zen practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I was living in the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I'm not so serious about this Zen practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But it's what I'm most serious about in my life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So, you know, it can be for someone who wants to really adopt a life of practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It can have greater priority than just about anything else."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But even that case, don't be too serious about it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Don't be so serious that it weighs you down."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's supposed to bring happiness, delight."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's supposed to gladden the heart."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So you want to kind of take that approach as you do, as you explore all this."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Another element that I want to point out as an introduction is that it's useful to think of the Buddhist spiritual life or the Buddhist development as a pyramid, as a three-sided pyramid."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And the importance of having a pyramid as a model for the path is a pyramid has a wide, stable base."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it's a little bit hard to tip over, push over a pyramid because of that solid base."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so what's at the top of the pyramid is supported by the whole pyramid below it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so if you want to build a stable pyramid, you first kind of lay the strong, broad foundation base."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then you build something that's almost as wide above that, and then something that's almost as wide above that, until finally you get really high and you get this little point at the very top."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "The point was to get to the top point really quickly."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And you had a very straight and narrow path that didn't create the foundation."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You'd have a stick like this standing up like this, and then it would just fall over."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it just falls over all the time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I know lots of people who have taken that kind of fast route in Buddhist practice have kind of dived into the practice or be engaged in or experienced."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Some of the, I guess I should say the highest, I was going to say deepest, the highest to be consistent with the metaphor, the highest aspects of Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it's been quite rewarding in some ways, but their lives have been like this as a result."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And sometimes rightfully so, very difficult for them to come back from that kind of peak experience because they haven't integrated the rest of their life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "They've been created at broad foundation."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it's a much healthier for people to create this broad foundation first for the highest practice and the highest realization."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So you want to be a little bit careful with teachers that want to give you the highest teaching right away, like myself."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You can come into my five-week intro in mindfulness class."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It turns out that mindfulness is considered one of the highest teachings."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So be a little bit larry of people like me."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And there was a Burmese teacher up in the festival."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And she once told me that, you know, in Burma people don't teach, people are not taught mindfulness off the street like they are in America."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Vipassana is kind of like the top of the pyramid."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And you would first do a lot of other work first preparing you for that higher point."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You know, in Tibetan practice they have Nundro, which you spend all this preparation practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You do 100,000 prostrations and 100,000 mantras and 100,000 making a little Buddha statues and I don't know what the other things, 100,000 offerings."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that's a lot of things to do."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that's kind of the preparation of body, mind and speech to get you to a point where you're ready psychically and physically to receive higher and deeper teachings."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's capable of giving people higher and deeper teachings, but it's not so useful unless they have that good wide base."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So I said the triangle is a three-sided triangle because the three sides are body, speech and mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so every layer as you go up the pyramid has a physical aspect, a bodily aspect."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It has a vocal aspect and it has a heart aspect or mind aspect."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Heart and mind are the same."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So body, speech and heart or body, speech and mind, whatever you prefer."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so it's very important to understand that it has those three aspects because again, sometimes people who engage in Buddhist practice tend to focus on one more than the other."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And most commonly they tend to focus on the mind or the heart, the inner life."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "As if it's all about changing something on the inside, changing your mind or having some kind of great mental experience of bliss or oneness or whatever people think."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Or about changing the mind in some way."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's all a mental kind of thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And Buddhist practice is not meant to be just a mental thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's meant to be totally integrated with our full humanity."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And the way that's said in the tradition is practice involves body, speech and mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So three sides of the pyramid."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so each layer has those three sides."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So we look at how it affects our speech, how it affects our behavior, and also how it affects our hearts or how it relates to the heart and the mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So I'd like us to do a short meditation in a few minutes."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But as an introduction to it, I'd like to give another piece."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Having to do with the heart or the mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But it also applies to the body and speech."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And that is all aspects of our psychophysical being is understood in Buddhism to be relatively malleable."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If it's developed, if it's cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "What human being is, human being is a process, another thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you want to try to find your true self, which some people like to use that kind of language, Buddhists would say, you won't find a thing as your true self."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "There's a movement and flux changing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And because the human being is a series of processes, and because it's not fixed processes, it's possible to shape those processes."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's possible to shape the mind because the mind is a process and not a thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's possible to change how we speak, because speech is a process and not a fixed thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's possible to change our body, our bodily behavior, because it's a process and not a thing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so part of Buddhist practice then is taking some responsibility for these processes of body, speech, and mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And beginning to shape them in ways that are healthy, helpful, and healing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And so how do we shape them? What is healthy, what is healing, what is helpful for us is a big part of what we're talking about in a little while."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But you know, so for example, if you feel that it's helpful to be kinder, it might not be easy to just decide to be kind just like that."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But it's possible to cultivate and change the heart, the mind."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So that becomes a disposition or inclination of the heart to the mind to respond to situations greater kindness."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And it's possible to develop kindness over time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's possible to develop generosity."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "It's possible to develop wisdom and love, mindfulness, concentrations, a lot of capacities that can be developed."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And probably it wouldn't take a lot of reflection on any of your parts if you were honest about yourself."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "To recognize ways in which your dispositions, your inclination, the way that you tend to operate in the world, has been shaped by forces outside of you, by things like advertisement or the media or your local environment."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I was surprised when I came to Palo Alto in 1990 that I had this, you know, old beat up Toyota, which I was very happy to have."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then for many years I was very happy having it in Palo Alto."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But at some point after being there in Palo Alto, I think it might be five or six or so years, I started noticing that I think I had one of the oldest cars in Palo Alto."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And there was this kind of thing of beginning kind of sense that I was different, you know, that all these people seem to be like a lot of people in Palo Alto have newish cars."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And just feeling, oh, you know, it's not quite right for me to have this old car."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And I could feel that this kind of environment, no one was doing anything, no one was saying anything, no one was telling a gill, you know, you should think about your car."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But, you know, it was just the environment landed itself to kind of influencing the shape of my thoughts and my disposition and kind of what I thought was I needed to have."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So the mind, so I use that little story as an example of how the mind can be shaped by the environment and by media, by friends."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I've been shaped by some of my friends hanging out with them."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Sometimes not to the best."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "When I was younger, I remember hanging out with people who influenced me in ways that I felt embarrassed to say, well, some of the things, some of the ways that I was."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "When I had a leather jacket and a motorcycle, I was in a pseudo motorcycle gang."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So they have shaping and they're taking some responsibility for that shaping."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But doing it in a way that brings you happiness doesn't come as a burden or a feeling that you should be different or you better be different."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You're inadequate in some terrible way or embarrassing it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But rather to do it with a kind of sense of uplift and lightness and joy."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Oh, yeah, isn't it great that human beings are this way? We have this capacity to develop and I can engage in it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "I don't know how long it's going to take to make a change, but at least it's great to know this and to incline the heart in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So taking a stable posture, you might think again of the pyramid as you make your posture."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "For those people sitting cross-legged, you get, you know, more obviously a sense of a pyramid."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But the idea, whatever way you sit, to get a sense of a stable base, perhaps a broad base, feeling the lower part of your body, relaxing your weight downwards, letting your chair or the floor receive you, hold you."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Spending some time with your body, feeling your body become familiar with your body, body, speech, and mind, the three kind of locuses of practice."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So just now, for now, just become familiar with your body as it is right now."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Explore different parts of it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Check it out, how it feels, what's going on in it."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "My guess is that most of you, as you're sitting here, having some thoughts going through your mind, for now we can just provisionally call them, that's the vocal part, the speech part."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "You're talking to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "As you're sitting here, see if you can take a little bit of responsibility for what you're thinking about."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And think about your body in kind ways, or happy ways."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "See if you can find some thoughts or some ideas, some understandings of your body, that bring you a sense of goodwill towards your body, or a sense of happiness or delight about your body."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "This is not positive thinking, you're not trying to pretend, but can you find some sincere thoughts of goodwill or delight? And then within the body is part of the body."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Become aware of your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you've had meditation instruction before, forget it, forget your instructions, and take a few minutes just to become familiar with what it's like to be breathing at this particular time."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And letting yourself think, don't have to stop your thinking."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But see if you can discover in the realm, the world of your thoughts, your understanding, your ideas."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you have any thoughts or can have any thoughts or ideas that involve goodwill towards your breathing, or a sense of happiness or delight concerning your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And then bring your attention more carefully to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Feel your breathing in your torso, your belly or your chest."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Feel the movement there, the expansion and contraction."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Feel the rhythm of breathing in and out."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as you exhale, see if you can relax and settle into that broad base."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Feel the weight of your body sink a little bit as you exhale, the weight of your belly, your torso."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Relaxing any tension you might be carrying in your torso, your belly, your chest."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as you exhale, see if you can relax."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Letting the breath wash through you, the in-breaths and out-breaths."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Letting it wash through your mind so that every time you exhale, you let go of your thinking."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Almost as if the breath or the waves washing up and down across the shore."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as the waves go out, leave the shore."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "As you exhale, it takes away."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Your thoughts carries them out to the sea."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And as you exhale, see if you can relax."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "So we're doing something very simple, being present here for our body, our breath."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Letting our thoughts soften or float away as we breathe out."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And is there anything about doing this here and now which gives you some inkling of happiness or delight or joy or satisfaction? Is there some happiness to be found in sitting quietly? Being attentive to what is here."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "And if there is some happiness, can you let that happiness support the attention to the breathing to be part of it? Thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "Is there any sense of well-being to be had that's available as you sit here quietly being in your body? You might be feeling other things also, discomfort or many things which might be uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "But even with that, can you find some inkling of well-being? And then as part of this short sitting meditation time, I'd like to ask you some reflective questions, questions we do think about in your eyes are still closed."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "If you're uncomfortable at all at this point, you're welcome to change your posture so you're more comfortable for the reflection."}
{"prompt": "Foundations of Buddhist Spiritual Life: Right Intention (week 1 - Part 1)", "completion": "What is your relationship to happiness? Does it feel like it's okay to be happy? Is it something you'd like to experience? Does happiness appear to you to be a profound goal of life or a superficial goal? Does it seem excessively selfish to pursue happiness? What's your relationship to happiness? Is it a stranger to you? Is being happy a gift for others? Have you ever felt someone else's happiness as a gift to you? What do you know about the healthy and appropriate pursuit of happiness? What stands in the way of your happiness? What stands in the way of your happiness? What stands in the way of your happiness? What stands in the way of your happiness? What stands in the way of your happiness?."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "For just a little bit of the guided meditation, I thought I would offer something that I have found useful, just a little piece that I found useful in my own practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "And it's the use of what we could call requests to help orient the mind in a particular direction."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "This use of requests, or sometimes they're called resolves."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "In my own experience, I found that there's a lot of instruction in use of resolves in terms of developing concentration practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "As you get closer to having a really settled mind, the mind becomes very amenable to being shaped by intention or shaped by requests."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "But I found in my own experience that if I'm very intuitive or if I'm kind of aware of what the level of subtleness is in the mind, then there are certain kinds of requests that can help shape what we could call the container of the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "So I found this out on one, no, it was at the forced refuge, actually."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "It was at the forced refuge."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "I discovered that when I sat down to meditate, I was having a lot of trouble doing anything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Like the mind was very resistant to any kind of, okay, do this now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "But I did discover that I could sit down and say to myself, may the body relax? And then I wouldn't try to do it, but I would just sit with that request and then see what the result of that request was."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "And I've discovered since that retreat that often, if I do a little bit of settling at the beginning of a meditation, just even the barest bit of settling at the beginning of a meditation, then the mind can be amenable to certain simple requests that can help to settle the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "I've talked about this before, so it's not new to some of you, but that's the shape of the guided meditation that I'll offer."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "So we'll just begin with, you know, just landing here in your body, just being as aware as you can, and allowing as much relaxation as is available or as possible for you in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "We'll be consciously relaxing areas of the body where there might be tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Maybe seeing if there's a way that the inside of the body might relax, you know, maybe the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Maybe the heart can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "And then exploring this possibility that kind of a request or intention might support relaxation of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Seeing what happens if you just drop in the request, may the body relax, and then not try to do anything with that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Let's just see what the results of dropping that into your body and mind are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Sometimes, not always when I do this, so if you don't notice anything happening, that is fine."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "But sometimes I see when I drop that and may the body relax and just sit there kind of attentive and attuned to how the body and mind are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Sometimes when I drop that request in, I feel some shift, a little bit of relaxing in some part of the body that I didn't even know was tense, didn't even know that it was possible to relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Sometimes I found it helpful to try a couple of times, just see what happened if I made that request every few minutes for a little while, maybe every 30, 40 seconds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Giving yourself plenty of time to just be with yourself after making a request like that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "It's not so much about looking for anything either, just being available, being with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "With some measure of relaxation of body and mind, you could play with a couple of different approaches with these requests."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "May the body and mind receive what is already happening with ease."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Or if you're more inclined to attune to one particular area of experience such as the breath, you could explore."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "May the attention rest with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "And again, not try to do it, do it, but just see how the mind and body respond."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "May the attention rest with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "May the mind receive the experience with ease."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Letting go of any expectations that this will happen, just seeing there might be some openness to that possibility."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "And if you find this useful or supportive, you're welcome to continue playing with these simple requests, see what happens."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Again, I'd suggest not very frequently, maybe once or twice a minute, not that often."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Give yourself plenty of time to just see what happens with each request."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Using Requests", "completion": "Or if you find this not landing or resonating, just let it go and explore the practices that feel most congenial for your mind in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Connecting to your body, just as it is in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Aware of the body sitting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's often helpful to check in and see if there can be a relaxation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Especially at the beginning of a period of sitting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "First thing, just acknowledge how you are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Just really with honesty, how are you in this moment? How is the body? Is there tension in the body? Then, exploring the possibility of relaxing, physically relaxing the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Perhaps there can be a relaxation in the head and face."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Softening around the eyes, the mouth, the jaw."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "As you relax the face, in a very broad, general way, seeing if it has an effect on your system."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Relaxing the neck and shoulders, arms and hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe the muscles of the chest and upper backs can soften a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "All those muscles around the rib cage."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Can the breath be easeful? And the muscles around the rib cage allow for an easeful breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes there can be a softening inside the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe there can be a relaxation down the spine."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes we hold ourselves up with our muscles."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And exploring the possibility of letting the bones, the skeleton, support the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Allowing the muscles to relax around the bones."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Allowing the muscles to relax around the spine."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe the hips can relax, the legs, the feet."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "The mind is tight or tense, not relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's often caught in thoughts of past or future, even thoughts about now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Thoughts about the meditation, ideas about the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe there can be just a relaxing of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Maybe the brain can relax, an analogy that Gil sometimes offers."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "As the body relaxes and the mind relaxes, it's supportive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It is supportive conditions for us to be aware of just the experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "The human experience of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "We all have our own individual sensations and feelings."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And part of the perspective of being aware, being mindful, is to step aside from the personal and just explore what is it like to be a human being that's experiencing this, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "This experience of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "There's body sitting here, sensations of body, pressures, pulsing, vibration, tingling, coldness or heat."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Perhaps moisture, dryness, pushing, pulling."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "These sensations are part of being human, just opening to the physical sensation of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "That includes the experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sitting in meditation with our eyes closed in a still posture."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Often the sensations of the body are one area that are pretty obvious, can be pretty obvious, just taking in, receiving."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "This is a way to open to mindfulness, rather than thinking about mindfulness as being choosing what I pay attention to."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Rather exploring the possibility of allowing mindfulness to just receive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "You don't have to be in charge of what it receives."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "In this stillness of the body, these sensations are one of those areas that tends to be available to know."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Relax, and in this moment, what is most obvious in this field of the body? Another area in this stillness that can be obvious in our experience is the experience of hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "You're hearing the sound of my voice, come and go."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Perhaps some ambient sound where you are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "That too is just experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "The human being is designed to hear when sound waves hit the eardrum."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's a human process, not personal."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "There's also emotions, moods that might be happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes these settle when we meditate, and sometimes they become more obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "There's no one way it happens."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Different conditions result in different experiences."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "No right or wrong here, just whatever is being experienced in this moment for you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Being aware of that is the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Nothing else has to happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Starting with relaxation, we can then receive our human experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "This human being sitting, breathing, feeling."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Perhaps thinking, often thinking a place where we habitually forget to be aware, but not."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's not necessary to lose awareness with thinking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's just something that's kind of habitual."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes we can actually settle back and just receive knowing, oh, this is a thought that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "This is what it's like for a human being to be thinking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And yet often we do get caught in the content of that thought, and we lose mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "There will be a moment when you remember mindfulness again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "You remember often that comes with the recognition, oh, I've been thinking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "That moment right there, that recognition, oh, I've been thinking, or I am thinking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "That's kind of proof that you can be mindful of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "You have become aware while thinking, perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "It's not always that we wake up into thought after we've been lost, but sometimes that's what happens."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "So aware, and of whatever we are aware of as mindfulness returns, perhaps the thought might be a sound, it might be a body sensation, it might be an emotion."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "But acknowledging or recognizing, oh, awareness is back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And this is what is being received."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes when the mind wanders into thought, as the mind wanders into thought, the thinking process has an effect on us."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Sometimes that effect is one that adds tension to our system, creates different emotions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And so sometimes it's useful in the return from thinking to check in and see, how am I now? Like we did at the very beginning, just this kind of taking inventory, how am I right now? And if there is tension that has come into the system, taking some time to soften that tension, relax, there's nothing in particular we need to come back to or need to do when mindfulness returns, except to take in that we're aware again and what's here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "There's no need to rush back to any particular experience, the breath, or any particular sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Awareness, being aware, is what we're cultivating, not awareness of some particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And yet for some, it can be helpful to choose or land with a particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "And if that's helpful for you, you're welcome to do that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Explore the possibility of a relaxed, receptive awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "Whether that's moment to moment receiving whatever is obvious, perhaps a body sensation, then a sound, and then a breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "If you're feeling more comfortable landing with one particular experience, such as the breath, for instance, or maybe hearing, maybe you can explore receiving the breath instead of aiming the mind or trying to find it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "How does the breath want to show up? Let it come to you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to our Human Experience", "completion": "The stance of relaxed, receptive awareness is a condition for being able to learn about our human experience, to learn about this being human."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So really warm welcome, warm welcome to everybody."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's nice to see you all, nice to be here, practice together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And today I'd like to share a little story that's out of Bante Gunnaraptana's book, Mindfulness in Plain English."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "This might, this was one of the first Dharma books, maybe not the first one, but one of the first Dharma books that I read."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I think the other one is like eight mindful steps to happiness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And I appreciated this book very much, Mindfulness in Plain English, right? It's just as the title suggests, it's really straightforward and was a very, for me, a very nice introduction to what this whole mindfulness business was about."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Not very in Dermatox, but, you know, Dermatox, one week to the next is just what inspires the Dharma teacher."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "They're not necessarily meant to be, you know, systematically laying things out."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So it was helpful to have a book."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I mean, I'll just say one tiny thing about Bante Gunnaraptana."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So Bante, that's just a generic term that we use for monastics, for monks, for men."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Often, if you're ever practicing with somebody who's ordained and is wearing the orange robes, then that's how we would address them as Bante."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I don't know, maybe in English something would be something like brother, maybe something like that would be equivalent, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then Gunnaraptana, this is a Sri Lankan name, he's from Sri Lanka."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he came to America in the 60s, and he started teaching meditation and mindfulness and the tradition that we practice and that I practice in."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he was, I don't remember the story, I think maybe at one time I knew he was given some property in West Virginia."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So you can imagine that might have been in the 70s or the 80s, I'm not sure, but you can imagine somebody from Sri Lanka going from West Virginia, people in the West Virginia were like, what is going on here and he was moving from Metropolitan Washington, D."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "when I what's going on here so wasn't always an easy place to be and I think I have heard, but I don't know if this is like within the last 10 years or 20 years or 30 years, that there still is kind of an uneasy relationship between this property that they have in West Virginia and the neighbors, they're not necessarily so keen on this weird quote unquote Buddhist thing that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, but I don't know if that's still true."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's a bit of a little context of the story."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, he has a shaved head, wears orange robes, right, so I mean he definitely looks like he doesn't fit in."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Let's just say that doesn't fit in if you just were to see him."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "There was this monastery in this practice center in this rural West Virginia one of the first in America."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he would goes for a walk every day that's part of his practice, you know for exercise as well as part of his meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he said that there was this man who lived down the road was very unfriendly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "When he takes his walk whenever he would see this man he would wave, and the man would be like driving and would just frown and look the other way and just pass on by."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And so, Ponte describes his reaction as even so I was not fazed by his attitude."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Whenever I saw him, I'd always wave and think kindly of him and sending him loving kindness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, this is Ponte's practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then, after about a year of this happening, the man's behavior changed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Ponte thought like, okay, some progress is happening."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe just this unfriendly quote unquote person down the street is becoming a little bit more friendly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "After another year, something miraculous happened."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "This is kind of Ponte's language."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Something miraculous after two years."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "That man down the street lifted one finger off the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And Ponte thinks, this is wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Okay, so all this loving kindness that I've been sending him and, you know, always thinking good thoughts and waving when I see him is having an effect."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Another year passes and Ponte still continues to wave and smile and now this guy raises two fingers off the steering wheel, right? After all these years, right? Two fingers and you know how the story goes, right? And then another year and he lifts four fingers off the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "This is a lot of time now that has passed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then he took his hand completely off the steering wheel and stuck it out the window and waved."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Like this is like a huge progress."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then as Ponte is telling the story that he saw the man parked on the side of one of these, on one of these forced roads, he's parked on the side of the road sitting there in his truck smoking a cigarette."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So Ponte just went over to him and started talking."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I don't know if they have ever had a conversation before."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "But, and Ponte writes that the first they started talking about the weather and then little by little his story starts to unfold."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It turns out that several years ago before Ponte had started waving to him, he had been in this terrible accident."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And while he was in the truck, a truck and almost every bone in his body had been broken."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he was in a coma for a really long time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then when Ponte had first started seeing him, he was just starting to recover."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "He could drive, but he couldn't move his fingers."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So he was just holding on to the steering wheel because that was all he could do at the time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, just Ponte just, you know, had this realization like, oh, you know, these assumptions that he had been making all these years turned out to be inaccurate."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It doesn't mean that this guy was the friendliest person ever, but you know, something was happening in his life that Ponte didn't know."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "But he still continued to wave and still continue to kind of send him loving kindness as was his practice as this person went by."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So what assumptions are we making about other people and their behavior? And what would happen if we realized that we actually don't know what motivates other people? And instead we assumed the best and gave them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Like, how would things unfold? How would it affect our lives? If that our assumptions, we recognize them as assumptions and didn't hold on to them tightly thinking that, well, this person is just unfriendly and is never going to be friendly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And there's a way in which doing some loving kindness is a way that can soften our hearts so that we don't always make the worst assumptions about people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Soften our hearts so that we can give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Soften our hearts so that we can continue to wave and say hello, even if they are not giving us a response that maybe is one that we're expecting or is one that suggests that they're so keen on our showing up where we are at that time or whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Something I appreciate so much about this story is that Vante, the way he tells the story, is he's meeting this person where this person is."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "He's not going over there demanding that things be different."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "We have to talk about this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he's not, Vante is not going out of his way to make sure that he runs into this person."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "When he encounters him, he has some warm heartedness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "He waves and in his mind wishes him well."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Because I don't want us to think that loving kindness practice means that we have to convert everybody over to being super kind all the time or we have to put on rose colored glasses and pretend that everybody's, you know, everything's perfect and we have to fake being nice all the time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "That's not what this is about."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "But we can start to notice what are our assumptions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And can we just hold them lightly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And can we, is there a way in which we can give people the benefit of the town."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And recognize that we don't actually know what motivates other people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Okay, so with that as an introduction."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Let's do some some practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Taking meditation posture."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Take a posture that feels steady and upright and yet has some ease with it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And moving into the moment, bodily experience inhabiting the bodily experience."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "What does it feel like right now to be in this body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Is there a way that you know that you are in the posture you're in to sit and know you're sitting."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "The signals that indicate to us that we're sitting."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "That the body be sense of the back being uplifted straight."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "What is it that makes you know you're horizontal."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "What is it that makes you shine on."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Moving into the rhythm of the breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Breathing the inhales and exhales."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Breathing the inhales and exhales."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's easy to feel some warm heartedness, some goodwill benevolence care respect."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Perhaps visualizing this level of being."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's an individual that you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Have in your life for whether it's for a kitten's puppies babies."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And we smile when I say those words can't help it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe there's somebody who's had a big impact in your life with their writings or their teachings."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Moving into a level of being."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Breathing the inhales and exhales."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then to support our cultivating loving kindness to support our intentions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "If we find the mind wandering, some kindness and some warmth, we just begin again with their phrases with connecting with the level of being."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe connecting to a bodily sensation that's associated with warmth, spaciousness in the chest, sense of ease."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Turning into that feeling of warmheartedness, this feeling of care."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "If it's there, it might not be there."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "You don't have to manufacture, create any particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "But if it is there, to inhabit that, to feel it, tune into it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And if not, you can tune into the warmhearted wish to be warmhearted."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's not so much that we shine the beam of loving kindness a different direction."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's more that we're just expanding that bigger so that it includes ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "You don't have to be perfect."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "One day I was making assumptions about the neighbor."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It turned out to be inaccurate."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Chances are, the assumptions we have about ourselves, the stories we have about ourselves, are also inaccurate."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Sometimes our inner critic is authoritative and believable."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "We all have this beauty, this goodness inside of us."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then to expand our loving kindness to neutral people, people we don't know."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Recognizing that any assumptions we make about another person, whether we know them or not, but especially if we don't know them, is going to be inaccurate."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "What would it be like to give people the benefit of the doubt? Assume the best."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "The neutral person, may you be safe."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Some equanimity practice can help us with not making assumptions or holding on to assumptions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So for this practice, bring to mind somebody that's in your life that you care about, that sometimes is a little bit troublesome, burdensome, irksome."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Bringing this person to mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Let me say this phrase, I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So this idea, of course we make assumptions, I mean that's how we navigate the world and it's helpful and it's wise to do that."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's about what's skillful, what's wholesome, what will be supported, what will be helpful, what will not be."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "The practice here is to not mistake assumptions for the truth."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Not think that our assumptions are actually the way things are."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Assumptions are helpful for us to make some decisions maybe, but we don't have to hold on to them and think that they're the absolute truth, especially when it concerns the motivations of others, especially when it concerns the inner life of other people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "You can see the way that they act and you know, assume all kinds of things about them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe some are true, maybe some aren't, but imagine how your life would unfold differently if the assumptions you were making were about assuming the best."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe this person's having a bad day."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe this person got some terrible news, somebody from a family member and that's why they're cranky or maybe this person is troubling at work because we remind them of some childhood character in their life that maybe was troublesome for them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I don't know, right? The point is that we don't really know and our life just would be a happier life in general if we just say, okay, this person's having difficulties, but may you be happy, may you be healthy."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And that uplifts our heart so that we don't get stuck in the story making and the, you know, the incredible stories that our minds can make and start thinking that they're true."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So it can be helpful to talk to others about this idea, but what are the kind of assumptions that we make for other people? What would it be like to start making good assumptions, assuming the best, giving people the benefit of the doubt? Like how might that affect our life? How might our life unfold differently if we had that as a way that we showed up in the world? So I'm going to put you into groups of three or four."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And an opportunity to just explore this idea."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And then this connection with loving kindness, of course, is that it makes it easier for us to assume the best if we ourselves have filled up with, we're feeling nourished with loving kindness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And it's so much easier to give the benefit of the doubt to others, as well as with loving kindness practice, there's a way in which it just becomes easier and easier and maybe even more the default way, not maybe, it does become more the default way in which we just approach others and approach the world."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, and then I'll just give these instructions that I like to always give is no need to say every idea that you have on this topic, maybe just make one point, go to the next person, they make one point, go to the next person, make one point, and then have it come back around."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So in this way, everybody has the chance to learn something new, hear something new, and have some new ideas, as opposed to just informing others about what you know, instead to together create a mandala, a mosaic of understanding of this idea of assumptions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Nobody have a comment or something they'd like to share."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So, in the group I was reminded of Donald Trump as a wonderful object to send loving kindness to rather than making assumptions and that was helpful because I haven't thought of Donald Trump in such a long time so that was helpful."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "You know, these people right that we make assumptions about."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I mean, where my assumptions have been kind of a fail and surely but slowly learned me not to trust them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So much behavior, both in people and animals that I have dealt with as a paradoxical in nature right where sometimes very aggressive behavior is driven by very fearful types of motivations or coping mechanisms and so what seemed to me apparent as a way to interpret something was maybe not as thoughtful as it could have been if I think in terms of the Buddhist concept of dependent causation and so that keeping that mind has been helpful to me if with more than just people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "That we ascribe meaning to behavior."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "I was thinking about the assumptions that we made about ourselves in which way you can turn around so can you give me some hints on that same question to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Yeah, so sometimes we might have this idea, especially when we're doing like metapractice and we find our mind wandering like this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Maybe slight and in the back of mind, but this you can't meditate."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Look, everybody else is meditating and they all have our filled with compassion and love but you can."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So I don't know what it is the exact words are but it's not uncommon for people to have this kind of inner critic that shows up and then we start to believe it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's like, oh, we can meditate or we're terrible meditators were losers."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "We shouldn't even come or, you know, I don't know what the story is."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "It's just habits that we have that we fall into that about are the way that we are and it's natural to protest and say but I have lots of data to support this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "These assumptions that we're making but there's other ways in which we can interpret some of these things and one of them is on pointing to is the power of habit, the power of the way we've been socialized the power of maybe there's some underlying fear or something that's wants to keep things a certain way and so there isn't a flexibility and seeing things differently."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "So this them kind of stores oneself helps create the conditions in which when the inner critic arises that we see like, oh, okay, thank you for your opinion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "May I live with these are you know, something like that was that is that helpful."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "This story about waving at the sour looking man who didn't wave back reminded me of Mr."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Charles, the guy who lived in Berkeley, and for 30 years, every single morning he stood on the same corner on Ashby Avenue and wave that the cars driving by."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And, and he took to wearing yellow gloves so that people could see his hands waving more easily."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he quit doing it in 1992."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And, and still on his birthday people put on yellow gloves and stand on the same corner and wave."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "And he's still waving actually too because there's a big mural of him right on that corner."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "Okay, so we're two minutes after the hour so I respect your time, but what a pleasure it is to practice together you know to share this practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Assumptions We Make", "completion": "If you like you can unmute and we'll say goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "To all of you, my goodness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I understand there's some sort of meetup tonight, so it's great that you decided to meet up here, and I hope you have a good time tonight."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "As Maureen said, I'm going to be here for the next three weeks, counting tonight, to offer a series of teachings from the Buddha's voluminous teachings on how to deal with conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "As you may have noticed, we don't have a lot of conflict in the world right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Things seem to be quiet and peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "People are getting along remarkably well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Our Congress is functioning at a high level, making decisions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I don't know about you, but I certainly have plenty of conflict in my life."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I have conflict most of the day between Daniel and Daniel."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then there are the people that I talk with."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Some of them are imaginary, but others are real."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And as a mediator, I deal with people caught in conflict all the time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "From my perspective, the Buddha is best known, or most accurately known, as the very first psychologist, not as the founder of a religion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Religions, and I have a lot of experience with them since I come from roughly nine generations of Southern Baptist ministers, including my father."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I had skipped a generation with me, maybe several."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Religions come from belief."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "They invite us to believe some aspect of teachings or a lot of aspects of teachings."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha explicitly said, do not believe what I say."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm not here to teach you to believe something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And if it turns out to be true for you, then continue to practice it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Belief and the difficulty we have with belief is one of the strongest forces of conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Because as the Buddha taught, we're obsessively attached to certain things that we like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We resist things that we don't like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He called that greed, the things we want, we're attached to, desire, or greed, aversion, or hatred, or anger, the things we push away, and delusion, or numbing out, or zoning out, or twittering away, unmindful of what's going on around us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Greed, hatred, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He said that untrained minds are the source of all of our conflict and all of our suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Our minds are like dogs running around, tied on a leash to a post, and they're running around the post, and around the post, and getting all tangled up in the leash, and in themselves."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the purpose of his teachings was to help us train our minds so that we could speak and see clearly who we and others are."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He taught, speak or act with a corrupted mind, and suffering follows as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows, like a never departing shadow."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Seems a pretty clear distinction."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But of course that begs the question of how we get there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Because if your mind is like my mind, it's far from peaceful most of the time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And in that lack of peacefulness, I come into contact with you, and I misperceive what you've said."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I mishear what you're wanting me to hear."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I get attached to something you say that I like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I get angry at something you say that I don't like."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I blank out a lot, because you say something, and it causes me to think of something, and I'm thinking of what I'm going to say in response to what you're going to say while you're talking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm listening to myself, and I'm preparing to speak as soon as you will just hush up, so that I can hop right in, and tell you what's really true."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I don't know if that sounds familiar to you, but it's the way my mind works."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So to train our minds is the focus of all of the Buddha's teachings."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I had a particularly humbling example of my untrained mind recently with a lawyer who practices frequently in the federal court up in San Francisco, where I'm one of the staff mediators, who is my chief teacher, I believe."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He trains me constantly in humility, and patience, and perseverance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And we had a mediation scheduled, and routinely the day before mediation, I call the lawyers separately on each side of the case to find out what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And he said the defense lawyer had filed what's called a motion to dismiss his case, and so they weren't really ready to go to mediation the next day."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that made sense to me, because when lawyers are not ready to mediate, it's not going to work out so well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I said, well, it sounds like we should postpone Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James, I'll call him, but I need to call Ms."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Waters, I'll call her, the defense lawyer, and see if she agrees, because, you know, I can't just cancel it because you won't do, we have to get agreement."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "After all, it's a mediation, and I'm not the judge."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Waters and I'll get back to you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I had a call scheduled with Ms."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Waters a few hours later, I called her, had a talk with her, and she didn't want the mediation postponed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "She had agreed with her client that they would offer the plaintiff a loan modification, it was a foreclosure case, and that was exactly the relief the plaintiff was seeking from the defendant, her client, but she didn't want Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James to know that in advance of the mediation, she just wanted to go forward."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I said, well, he wants to postpone, so I'll see if I can get him on the call, and I'll call you back and we'll work it out."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James' office and his secretary said, he's gone for the day, and he can't be reached."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I had no reaction at that point much."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I wondered if I was being played, and I said, well, it's very important, I have a call set up to talk about the mediation in the morning at 10 o'clock, so please have him call me right away."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "45 minutes or so went by, and no call, so I called again."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "This time I was pretty reactive, and I said, where is Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James? He hadn't called me back."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "She said, he's gone for the day, but he left you a message, and I thought, oh, he left me a message with her, but he didn't return my call."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the message was the mediation is canceled, neither my client nor I are coming."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could probably see steam coming out of my ears because I don't like being disrespected in that way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the rules, after all, the court rules require lawyers to cooperate with a mediator, and he was far from cooperating."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So my voice raised a little bit, and I spoke very clearly and firmly, get in touch with Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James and have him call me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I called back the third time I spoke with the office manager, I was unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James calling me back? He's left another message."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He says the mediation is canceled, and in the midst of this, not very proud of it, am I conversation, in walks my colleague, who runs the mediation program, and he said, you should come down to my office and hear a voicemail that Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Oh, he called Howard, he didn't call me, but he's unavailable and not playing me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I went down the voicemail, as you can imagine was awful, it was all about how I had agreed to cancel the mediation, and I was inappropriate with his staff."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I imagine you've never experienced anything like that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha taught that there are six roots of conflict, six spaces that we get into that create all conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Anger, I was certainly caught in anger."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Arrogance or contempt or insolence, I was definitely feeling that he was being that way, and I was unmindful of how I was being that way, because after all, I was the mediator for the court."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Envy or avariciousness, I felt like he was playing me, and I didn't like it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I was acting in a way that was not appropriate for me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I thought the fourth one is deceitfulness, he was clearly being deceitful and not telling the truth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He didn't want the mediation to happen for some reason, and he was playing me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Five is evil wishes are wrong view."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I certainly had evil wishes for him, and he for me, and I had a wrong view, and the wrong view we'll talk about a little bit more."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It's my view that it was about me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I was taking what he was doing personally, and he had wrong view also."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He was taking what I was doing personally."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And last, we cling to our views, we cling to our anger, we cling to our arrogance or contempt, we cling to our envy, we cling to our deceit, and we cling to our evil wishes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We get caught in that way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha offered a framework for all of his teachings in his very first sutta or sermon, known as the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm going to reword them just a little bit about conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The first one is no conflict as dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The word dukkha is a Pali word that is often translated as suffering, not very accurately or dissatisfactoriness, a little more accurately."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The etymological root of the word is an axle wheel that's out of balance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If you can imagine the hub of a wheel and the axle, the wheel goes around the axle, if the axle hub is not true, you're going to have a very bumpy ride."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So dukkha is the bumpy dissatisfactory ride we have in life because our minds are out of balance and not true."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Knowing conflict as dukkha is not an intellectual matter."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It is an experiential knowing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "As I guided our meditation, I suggested that you note, inhale and exhale or note thinking or note sounds, note or label it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So if I had been mindful with Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James, I would have been labeling or noting, ah, conflict is arising."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I would know it in that moment as an experiential knowing rather than intellectually understanding it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I would have access to that knowing in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "That's knowing the first noble truth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "In the moment of my experience of it, this is the dukkha of conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Conflict is like this, knowing the first noble truth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The second one is knowing that clinging is the source of dukkha or suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So that's how I got hooked because I was clinging to my anger."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If you are an angry type, like I am, getting angry feels good."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It feels not so good afterwards when I realize I've been angry."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But in the moment, there's a shot of adrenaline and my mind is trained in that way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I have over years of habitual patterning and grooved my mind to slip right into a place of anger, of envy, of arrogance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I don't recognize that when it's arising most of the time and I certainly didn't then that day with Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So knowing the second noble truth experientially, not intellectually, is in the moment being able to say, I'm clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "This is clinging to my view."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "This clinging feels like this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I know the feeling of anger and I recognize it in the moment, not later but then."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Knowing the second noble truth is knowing that clinging is dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I want to be respected as a mediator."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I want to be appreciated for my work."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I have a self that can be pushed and hurt and hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Wanting that respect that causes me to cling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Now, if I just knew that conflict was dukkha and I knew the conflict in the moment and I then knew and recognized in the moment that I was clinging to that suffering, clinging to that unskillful way of relating to life, it could be very depressing because that's a pretty constant experience that we all have."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But the Buddha was a brilliant psychologist."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He named our disease dukkha, the dissatisfactoriness of the way we live our life and he named the cause of the disease which is clinging and not recognizing our clinging and then he named the cure for the disease."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The cure is knowing that dukkha, knowing the cessation of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So had I known I was creating conflict in that moment, not intellectually but experientially, and recognized my clinging, I would also recognize when it ceased because we have moments of peace in our mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We have moments when we're in touch with our heart, when we're in touch with being connected to one another and those moments are the cessation of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But we go right by those too on automatic."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We're not conscious of them."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We're with our friends and we're having a beautiful walk and talk and we're connecting with them and we're off in our head somewhere, planning what we're going to say, thinking about something that's going on in our life, not being aware of that precious moment of cessation of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So we know the conflict in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We know the clinging, the stickiness of that experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then we know we experience the moments when it passes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The whole of life is in those three steps."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then the fourth noble truth is the path by which we practice to be able to be mindful of those three steps, knowing the place we're caught, knowing that we're caught, the stickiness and knowing the cessation, the wise view, the wise intention, the wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, and the wise effort, wise mindfulness and concentration, the eightfold path, their specific practices that the Buddha gave us to train our minds."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He also gave us some specific teachings around conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And there are three of them that I want to talk about tonight."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "One, I imagine you're not very familiar with being the son of a Southern Baptist minister."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm very familiar with this one."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It's called the entanglement of I'm right and you're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The second one is reflecting on truthfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Actually, there are four that I'll talk about tonight."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The third one is recognizing when we're hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And off I went, running down a neuroscientific groove in my mind, what yoga would call a samskara."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If you took a sled up to the top of a new snowed hill with no marks in that hill and you went down the snow and then dragged the sled right back up that same path and went down again and dragged it right back up the same path over and over."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "That's what we do with our minds."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And we create that groove that our mind hops into."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And we think that we're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So knowing when we're hooked and then finally developing wise view."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So the I'm right, you're wrong teaching comes from a time when the Buddha was talking to some Brahmins scholars who taught the ancient Vedas that went back way into time and were the foundation of all the Hindu teachings that were in the Indus Valley when the Buddha was teaching."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And this young Brahmin master who was only 16 years old named Kapithika said master Gotama in regard to the ancient Brahmic hymns that have come down."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Brahmins come to the definite conclusion only this is true."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "What does master Gotama have to say about this? So Kapithika was challenging the Buddha about his teachings and saying the Brahmins say that the Vedic scriptures are the only truth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "That's exactly what my father taught me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And as far as I can tell, that's what most religions teach that my way is the only true way and everything else is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that distinction is inscribed in our human DNA as far as I can tell because almost everyone who comes into mediation with me believes firmly that they are right and the other party is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And they have a whole long brief and lots of evidence to prove that they're right and you're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It's such a fundamental human trap."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the Buddha taught Kapithika he said do any of these great Brahmin teachers who wrote the Vedas, could they say of their own personal experience that what they wrote was true? And Kapithika had to acknowledge they could not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And so it is with all belief based teachings."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The believer cannot say of her own personal experience this is true."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It's based on approval from those we respect."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Reasoning sometime or some reflective practice."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So for example, I could believe that Toyotas are the best cars."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I would either be right or wrong, but I could believe it based on my faith."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'd still be right or wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could believe it because people I respect told me they were good."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'd still be either right or wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could believe it by tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "My family always had Toyotas."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could study the repair records of all the Toyotas cars and all the other cars and I would still just be right or wrong or I could reflect on my own driving experience with Toyotas."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Mostly we're not that detailed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If we reason in this way, the Buddha said, we see that a wise person recognizes that no matter the basis for our belief, unless it's our own personal experience, like we know we're here right now in this room of our own personal experience, that kind of knowing, unless it's that kind of knowing, we're either right or wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So approaching conversations, approaching conflict with humility is required."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha specifically said, a wise person who desires to honor the truth says, my faith is thus, but I cannot come to a definite conclusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Mindfulness carries us this way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He then taught his son, Rahula, about truthfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We think of truthfulness, he said, in a very narrow way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We think of it in the way we speak."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But he asked Rahula, what is a mirror for? And the Rahula said, it's for looking at your reflection."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And truthfulness is a way to reflect on who we're being in a moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Am I truthful, not just with my words, but with the way I'm seeing you and me, with my body, with the thoughts that are running through my head, are they in synchrony with the words that I'm speaking? Is my body language, my energy, the way I'm acting around you, is that being truthful? How many times have we said to someone, oh, you look great, and we're thinking something very different, and our body betrays us, but we have this wonderful human agreement."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I won't call you on it if you won't call me on it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We have a degree of social politeness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But in terms of opening our hearts and clarifying our minds, reflecting on truthfulness in this way is an important aspect of dealing with conflict more skillfully."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If I recognize the humility of letting go of I'm right and you're wrong, and then I reflect on being with you in a fully synchronous, truthful way, I've taken two big steps towards resolving any conflict with you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then I have to see when I get hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There was a big argument among the Kosambians who were students of the monks of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I love this description."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "They were in hostile factions, and they were stabbing each other with verbal daggers."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James and I were stabbing each other with verbal daggers."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha said that there are eight ways we get hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And they're very helpful because the teachings were handed down in an oral tradition for 500 years."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So the list were mnemonic devices for remembering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And these eight obsessions are the first five are the five hindrances that you may have heard about."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I get hooked when I want something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I get hooked when I don't want something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I get hooked in that state."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The anxiety of modern living."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "That restlessness and worry hooks us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm really unsure about what you're saying."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm unsure about how I'm feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm unsure about the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm speculating about what's going on with you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm speculating about what went on in the past between us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha's words where I'm speculating about this world and I'm speculating about the other world."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then finally we get caught by obsessions when we're quarreling and brawling and we're caught we're stabbing with verbal daggers."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James by my aversion to his disrespect."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I was hooked by my desire for wanting his respect and wanting him to treat me respectfully."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I was completely oblivious to how I was not paying attention and being unmindful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then the fourth of these specific teachings is how do we develop wise view when we're caught in the midst of conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "In the effacement sutta the Buddha responded to a practice to a question about how to practice mindfulness when we're caught in wrong views."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And he encouraged us to say this is not mine."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So he gave us a specific note to apply."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James was acting the way he was acting."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could have said this is not me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Can you feel the letting go that's available there when I get into it with my right wing fundamentalist sister."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I get into it a lot less these days because when I'm with her I do say this is not mine and it's not her."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It's what her mind is hooked and I'm not going to get hooked by her hook."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm not going to be obsessed by the five hindrances or speculating about her world or my world or getting caught in brawling with her."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'm going to reflect on being truthful and synchronous with my speech and my thoughts and my body when I'm with her because I know that it's a powerful ancient battle that we're fighting with each other."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There's no permanent Daniel about which it could be."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Have you noticed how much you change? Have you noticed how during the course of the day you're different? Have you noticed that when you get up in the morning and you decide that it's going to be a bad day sometimes it is because you hold on to that thought as if it were permanent and have you noticed sometimes that you get up and you think it's going to be a bad day and something happens that surprises you and suddenly it all shifts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We suffer because we think it's about us and we hold on to those thoughts as if they were permanent and fixed and that creates our suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And those are the three what the Buddha called the calaisis."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The self, the attachment to the self, not recognizing everything changes all the time creating suffering or dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that's exactly what I did with Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Fortunately when I call Ms."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Waters back to let her know about all the difficulty I was having getting in touch with Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James to my surprise he had called her."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So he had called his office, he had called my colleague Howard and he had called Ms."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Waters but he hadn't called me back."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Now that I'm here in my role of teacher of course it wasn't about me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "She agreed to postpone the mediation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But the voicemail that he left for Howard was not only was I such a terrible person and I had lied and promised to cancel and then reneged but he was not going to mediate this case with me and he was not going to mediate any other case with me ever."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that would make things difficult."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Given the nature of our work and given the fact that he files many lawsuits in our court."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So that required a cleaning up of that incident."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Which required a lot of practice for me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Over a good period of time before Howard convened a mediation between me and Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And he was a former pugilist in college."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So he's that kind of body type."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But I had done a lot of meta practice for him and myself a lot hours."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I was in a good place about him."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I was really practicing noticing where I had been hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Being consistently truthful in my words and my body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Being aware of how I was holding that I was right and he was wrong."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And being aware of it wasn't mine."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I was practicing these four specific teachings of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the conversation went well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There was no deep heart connection."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But he was okay with going forward with mediation with me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And reflecting on truthfulness I took a very courageous step."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I knew that I had to stand with him in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I said after everything was all nice and smooth and Howard was very pleased that we had managed to get through it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I said why didn't you just pick up the phone and call me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He brought both hands down on the table."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I knew I had to do that to maintain some relationship with him of some equality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I had to stand for the self that I am not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It is a paradoxical thing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I could not completely collapse and neither can you when you're in a conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "We have to stand for ourselves while we acknowledge that it's not about myself."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The explosion passed and I knew that I had gotten through to him that I would not simply roll over every time he wanted something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "That was an important balance place to be."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha also taught that at the time we have concluded a conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "People from each faction, a leader from each faction, should stand up, arrange their clothing, fold their hands and confess."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I have said some unskillful things and I ask that you cover them over with grass."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Not the kind they grow up in Arcata, but the green grass."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I ask that you cover them over with grass."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So there's a time for having peace and letting go and moving on."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So the Four Noble Truths, no conflict as dukkha, know that clinging is the source of my conflict, clinging to my view, clinging to my view of myself, clinging to being right or wrong, and know that that conflict can cease, that every conflict can cease internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If I practice the Eightfold Path to train my mind and become more awake, to see the trap of right and wrong, to see the trap of not being aware of consistent truthfulness in my body, speech, and actions, to see where I'm obsessed and hooked, and to see where I'm caught in it being about Daniel."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Next week, I will talk about the source of our conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "What is it that we all carry and we all have inside us that is the source of every conflict we have? And two weeks from now, I haven't decided what I'm going to talk about, but I'll talk about something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So we've got time for just a few questions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Thank you very much for the great talk."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I guess I'm going to just buy into the question of the night is, what did Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "James say to answer your question? You know, I don't even remember because it was just this explosion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He never answered the question."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "He railed for a while and I sat and truly, I was ready."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I just was going, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And he calmed down and sort of got over his embarrassment, but I believe and it's been reflected."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "In fact, I didn't laugh because he was sincere."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "In a recent mediation, he'd exploded like that again with the other parties in the room and I said, Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And later he came up to me and he said, you know, I'm really impressed that you are able to deal with my upset without getting hooked."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And he said, I've tried that meditation stuff."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So there's even hope for the Mr."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "What was also very fascinating was to follow one comment about why you threw the bomb."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The need to establish, even though you didn't, even though we don't have a true fixed self, but you still had to play the paradox or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Be yourself, although not having one."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Because if I don't, I am not truly present with you and I am not being truthful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I am allowing myself to be so not self that I don't even show up with you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that's not serving you and it's definitely not serving me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Thank you very much for being here tonight and thank you everyone else."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Maybe talk a little more on the acceptance of like our suffering and being able to accept all of the, that path of being able to try to move forward."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I find that there are times when I am not accepting of the suffering that I'm experiencing and I'm in those times I see when I wake up, it's like I'm caught in a fog and I believe that that suffering is permanent."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I've gotten caught by a Nietzsche impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There are places in my life where I have a blindness and believe that the suffering that I experience is my karma."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I just, it's never ending."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And those are the places I really have to work."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And the key for me always is recognizing, ah, this is the cessation of that dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Maybe it's just a couple of minutes in the midst of a time of deep suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Maybe it's a whole afternoon or maybe it's like just this Tuesday night when I had dinner with a good friend and was able to share with him in a deep personal way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And that suffering for that moment ceased."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So I could come back to the recognition that indeed that fundamental teaching of the Buddha of impermanence is the key to dealing with the deep, difficult suffering that hooks me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Someone else? Yes, over here."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "How long were you meditating before you realized that it was an easy practice? I have meditated and I have a little difficulty because I'm not, well, I was good."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Sometimes you don't feel inspired."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I was wondering if you had any advice for uninspiration to meditate because I like it and it's fun and I was good at it, but it's hard now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I've been meditating for since 1976, so what's that, about 30-something years."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I still haven't experienced that it's not hard."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Yeah, is that the dukkha that you were talking about? Yeah, that's good."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Yeah, I was having trouble with that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I noticed that you had your eyes closed throughout the whole meditation and I was like, I've never done that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If I close my eyes, it might be a more powerful meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Yeah, and a place to find that is find a place in your body that you can focus your attention on."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It might be your belly, it might be the tip of your nostrils or the rising and falling of your chest and just bring your attention there and soften your body, relax your body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And it starts to get easier."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But it is a hard and challenging practice."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "If mindfulness were easy, we would all be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And there are moments when the mind lets go and the feeling of ease arises."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Yeah, because I've done some powerful meditation before and I'm here because I think it would be a good place to meditate again, but I've been having difficulty and I guess that's the dukkha that you've talked about."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Lots of different things to learn about, like the eight-fold path."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I think Buddha's biggest teaching was on the act of self-love."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Other questions? One more."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Right here on the yellow shirt."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I'll say thank you again that this made a really great meet-up event because I'm the one who asked my members to come."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "In the topic of conflict, if I had a conflict with someone in the past and we couldn't reach a mutual agreement, so we didn't talk to each other anymore."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "But I do see his point and I know where I come from."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So do we just let it go or what do we do? So you clearly haven't let it go."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "Or meditate some more and let it go."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "It would be nice, but I often find that my meditations are a conversation with the person that I'm in conflict with, that I'm incomplete with, and they say all the right things then because I'm having both sides of the conversation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And instead of being present, I'm back in that conflict."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So you will know what's the right move for you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There are places in my life where I've had difficult conflict with people close to me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I've tried to resolve it with them and I've not been successful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "So when they arise for me, I do loving kindness practice for me and for them."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And I notice that dukkha has arisen."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I know the dukkha of the conflict with, for example, my stepson."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I know that I'm clinging to my view of how it should be."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then I know when he's gone and when that conflict is not present, it's ceased."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And then it will come back and that's the way life moves."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "There will be a moment, there may be a time when that person will come back to you in your life and there they will be."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And if you have practiced in the meantime and have done loving kindness practice for you and for them, when that moment comes, the whole thing may unravel and fall away and be complete."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I've had that happen many times and it's very joyful."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "What we need will come and when you're ready, that will happen."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "The thing for you to do in the meantime is practice to train your mind to be ready when it comes."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And most profoundly, be grateful for yourself, for coming, for being here and for taking away something of value for all the conflicts that will arise for you in the future."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "And may the merit of our practice go out into the world, especially and touch all of those we love and all of those in our relationships."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 1)", "completion": "I hope to see many of you next week."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So continuing this topic of exploring the teaching of not-self primarily through looking at what we take to be self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I just thought I'd recap a little bit what we've explored in the last few weeks around this, the last sessions around this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "You know, basically starting with the teaching of not-self itself, what is that teaching? You know, what is it? What does it mean? How is it expressed? And I guess I would say in a nutshell, we could say that, well, two pieces."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "One is that it seems like there's a self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It feels like there's a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But what we, when we, when we don't look at that carefully, we will assume it's something that it's not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so essentially, our sense of self, what we take to be I, me, is a misunderstanding."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "We are attributing a kind of a permanence or a kind of a traveling through time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Often this is the way it comes about."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "The sense of self feels like it's like traveling through time, that there is some thing or entity or being that is stable and traveling through time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But what the teachings of the Buddha point to is that this experience is simply a conditioned changing experience and that actually what that, that the experience of the sense of self is an arising experience that is kind of an ideal or a concept."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "One way to put it might be from the teaching of dependent origination, which talks about both how suffering comes to be and how a sense of self comes to be, that the sense of self is a response to wanting things to be a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that when we kind of out of out of a misunderstanding that having what I want will make me happy or having getting rid of what I don't want will make me happy out of a kind of a misunderstanding of that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "When we get something that we want, then a sense of self springs into being in an attempt to or in a kind of a way to, in the service of that wanting to control or to manipulate or to continue that that direction."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So the sense of self can be understood kind of as a set of patterns that are in the service of clinging and craving."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So the teaching of not self is important in a way because it is through this misunderstanding that a lot of suffering is perpetuated."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And this is really the key."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's not to understand not self just because it's a teaching of the Buddha, but it is to understand how what we take to be self contributes to suffering in our own experience and in the world."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so that's part of the investigation, part of the curiosity, and in exploring what we take to be self, often we do find, and I certainly found for myself, I had strong identifications around particular mental habits that were deeply tied to suffering, a strong habit of identification around self-hatred, a deep suffering pattern, other patterns of identification, a kind of an opposite pattern to that of I can do things really well."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And in a paradoxical way, I found, you know, that those two patterns were dependent on each other."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That the sense that I could do things really well was kind of holding a standard and ideal in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And when I couldn't do everything really well, it was proven that I couldn't do everything really well, I would flip into the pattern of self-hatred."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I'm a failure, I'm no good."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so both sides of that, I thought, I thought when I first started observing this, I thought I was supposed to get rid of the hatred side and just feel good about myself, you know, that I'm a good person, that I can do things well."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But that identity itself was also suffering in that it was a setup or a kind of an ideal that I had to always achieve."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so this, as we start to look at these identities, as we start to get familiar with what we take to be self, we begin to see how they play into our patterns and habits of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And this is really the key to this whole topic."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's not trying to come to some kind of abstract understanding of not self just for its own sake, but to understand what we take to be self and how we, how that is participating in how we are suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That it is a construction of mind, that it is conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That sense of being the one, you know, the one who felt like they were a failure, that was a conditioned arising."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "The one who felt like she knew what she was doing, that was a conditioned arising."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so the understanding of that, what we take to be self, is this conditioned tumbling on essentially."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then last time, at a certain point, we also explored a piece of this, a piece of the identity, one major way in which we tend to construct a sense of self is around this area of control, of wanting to control, to fix, to hold onto."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And that fits in very much, the Buddha actually highlights the sense of control as a key place where we identify."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And he kind of component of the construction of the sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so, and that fits in very well with this sense of the sense of self being the arising in the service of craving and clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "To control that I still, you know, that I can keep things that I have, that I can control my environment to be the way I would like it to be."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then last time we talked about studying possibly or recognizing a kind of identity connected to more relational exploration, like the kind of identities that we have, or that we put on other people, that we talked about selfing and othering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And the, you know, the othering piece, we can, we can other other people, and we can other ourselves, and we can be othered by other people."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that the the identities around other, or we could also, I talked about a little bit that there, that we can other in terms of individual, you know, particular people, but often the othering happens in terms of group identities, collective identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And we create a sense of us versus them."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And, you know, so that exploration not explicitly talked about as far as I know in the in the suttas, although there are places that the Buddha does speak about the conventional understanding of discriminations between people, just being conventions in the mind, that they're just ideas, they're just concepts, there's one particular sutta where the Buddha points to the number of ways that we often discriminated or kind of discern differences between people."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And he lists the whole host of things, you know, the kind of hair you have, the kind of skin you have, the height, your height, your body, your gender, the way you make love, all kinds, he mentions all of these things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And he says, these are just conventions, you know, these just these, these are not inherent differences in human beings, it's just conventions that make these seem like differences between people."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So he did speak to that, that that it is just concept essentially, these differences that we we have between people."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But I think, you know, it is a place that's worth our exploration, especially in our culture, you know, this seems to be a major area of suffering, this othering, this discrimination, these identities, these us versus them, you know, it comes in political identities, in gender identities, in identities around race and religion and all kinds of differences that we kind of we delineate between people and decide who we like, who we don't like, we have ideas and views that we attach to groups based on those identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then we we tend to relate to individuals through our views about a group, rather than directly with an individual."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And again, this is this is important to understand that this is large, this is, you know, this is conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's when I when we talked about it last time, I pointed to this being a very kind of natural process that unfolds in in our, you know, the way that we're brought up, we tend to gravitate to the people who look like us, who act like us, who do the things that we do."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So there's a kind of a comfort in that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then we tend to gravitate towards that comfort."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then if there's other other people doing different things or looking in a different way, it may create some discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so we we we feel a little bit of discomfort and we pull away."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that, you know, it's it's a natural part of our system that we tend to gravitate towards the comfortable, the familiar."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But it is just conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so it doesn't have to be forever encoded this way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So we can, through awareness, through mindfulness, begin to notice when these these views and these ideas are influencing how we relate to each other."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So there were a couple questions and I wanted to get to some questions this time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That's what I promised last time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "There's one one question from the question submitted in advance."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And I'll read this and just speak to it lightly."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then we'll see if there's any comments or questions in in the group about anything we've talked about in the last few weeks."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So the the question is about collective identity."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I'm curious about not self in the context of a collective identity, seeing self as separate or part of a whole, and how the self-group relationship affects the different decision-making models consensus top down or a combination."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So I would say, you know, we all do, I think, have some collective identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I mean, it's very natural, again, you know, that we would identify with, you know, for me, I identify as a female cisgendered."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So I have a female sexual identity at birth and I feel like a female, although that was a process, I would say, and heterosexual middle-class, maybe upper middle-class from from my childhood well educated."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So there's a whole bunch of different kind of groups or identities that white, you know, that that I have kind of a sense of of an association with."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Now some of those are identities that kind of were given to me were put on me or kind of conditioned into me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "The the the socio-economic class, that was conditioned into me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I mean, the the sense of of, you know, experience I have around financial security, you know, we had no financial insecurity when I was a child, and so that kind of was part of my experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so that's a part of my experience now."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that was just conditioned into me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so some of these some of these identities are conditioned into us in that way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Some of them are ones that we pick up as we go through our lives, ones that we choose to bring to into our experience, and some of them are ones that are put on us."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "There are definitely times when I felt like when I was in the computer programming field, for example, you know, that I felt like I had the identity of female put on me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "You know, that you know, the female engineer was not very common, you know, in in my when I was a computer programmer."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "There were some of us, but you know, so the identity of female wasn't one that I was particularly identified with in being a programmer, but it was one that was put on me and one that I felt some rub against, you know."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So sometimes these these collective identities are put on us, and sometimes they are taken up by us, and sometimes they're just naturally conditioned into us."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "What I think is most important here, the question here about how does this affect different decision-making models, well I would say that the most important part of in terms of what we're exploring here in terms of the Buddhist understanding, the most important part is how do these identities affect choices that relate to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "When we make choices out of these identities, when we make choices othering other people, you know, if we're if if the choices that we're making are creating suffering in the world, then and those those are connected with the particular identities, those we need to really see."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So it's this is all our own exploration."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "These identities, the collective identities very much are not our own doing, you know, they are cultural doings in a way, but they're not they're not just one individual creating it, creating these collective identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "These are these are identities that are that come through kind of a group conditioning in a way, and so the the way that we are conditioned into these all of our identities is it's not just what's happening to us, it's this kind of interweaving between what what happens in the world, how other people relate to us, how how the how we are related to in the world, how we relate to the world."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So there's this interweaving in terms of choice and decisions and and that those choices and decisions we affect each other, and so there's this very much this looping or this interaction that happens in the choices that we make based of on our identities, those choices don't just end at our skin, they go out into the world, and so we need to be very aware of our choices and how they affect not only our experience, but how they affect others."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Now the Buddha definitely talked about this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "The the the teaching often that's that we talk about here in the West is very often focused on what's happening in this being, you know, looking here and seeing as they're suffering here, but the the Buddha really spoke over and over again around noticing not only how your your actions, your choices affect yourself, but how they affect others."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "He frequently said notice how it affects yourself and others and both."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Is it causing affliction in self or other or both? He frequently talked about this and so this is this is the place this is the terrain to look with identities and suffering and choices are our choices based in particular identities or group identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Are they creating suffering in the world? Now there are some times I think that that certain identities what I think is important is that we understand when identity that I what identities are."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "They are an agreement with oneself and one's others."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's not something inherent in who we are."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's a concept that we have adopted and those concepts can sometimes be useful and sometimes be harmful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so sometimes, you know, for instance, you know, this is a this is a kind of a simple example in a way, but there was a period of time where I adopted the identity of being a meditator and that helped me to, you know, kind of support my ability and my interest in connecting with the practice really supported a letting go of some of that self-hatred, a lot of that self-hatred."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then there was a particular point where the identity of being the the meditator began to be suffering in itself."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "There was that, you know, that holding it up and then there's the success and failing around that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "You know, I'm a good meditator."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I'm failing at meditation and and so at that point, that identity then became something else to look at as a source of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But it was useful for a time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "For a long time, actually, it was really useful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so, you know, it supported me in being able to navigate some of the really like wildly unhelpful mind states that the mind was in."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so there are times when identities, whether they're personal identities or collective identities, can be supportive."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Just, it's important to understand that they are something that we're adopting for a period of time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "They're useful or not useful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, just like mind states, can be skillful or not skillful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Identities can be skillful or not skillful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But still, it's helpful to understand that they are a conditioned, not a thing, not who I am, but just a frame that is supporting me in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, yeah, other other questions or comments that was that's so what I wanted to say about that that topic."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Anything about the teaching or comment about this and you're let me just make sure you can unmute yourselves."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Yes, you can unmute yourselves if you have a question."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And I do want to continue recording this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, if you prefer not to have your voice recorded, you can type in the chat."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, the question is it okay where you are? Are you safe from the fires and that to everyone? I am safe from the fires on the peninsula here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "There were fires within 12 miles of me at one point, but at this point on the peninsula, in the last two days, the air has radically cleared and we can breathe again, which is wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, yeah, I know others others in various places are not so fortunate."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, yeah, it looks like Olga, you're still in some smoke, huh? Ali."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, the couple of things that came to me all speak fast so I can get to both of them."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "One is with my own, you know, identity as you were speaking with."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's just like I am of a, you know, Middle Eastern background male and then, you know, it just portrays us especially in the, you know, in the past, in the near future, near years as a certain type and then in order to, in some groups, I have had to probably drop the eye and go with the owl, you know, just to fit in with that group."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "No, I didn't quite understand you."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Drop the eye and go with the."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Yeah, the eye of the alley and then just I call myself like owl."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Just a no, no, no, no, not the eye itself, but the eye of my name."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And just to fit in because of the basically economic reasons and then my projection of how am I seen or whatnot, spoken or not spoken."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that, that created and I have like, you know, cringed a bit inside as I have done that, but I have done it and then, but, you know, in these circles."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I know in that circumstance what it sounds like there was a little bit of protection."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so it was a little bit of protection from that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then so, yeah, that's, I guess, that part of it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I continue to investigate, but thank you, you know, in this, in this, in this circles and many other circles and I have, as I have aged, I'm way more, I don't really care, but that might be some of it is my own projection outward."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I'm not sure it exists in every group or, I mean, in every encounter or not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That's first part of the question."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And then the second part that I was going to also ask you to see if there has been studies of individual cultures versus the collective, how the self arises here is individualistic, more individualistic society."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So just see me, I'm doing this, this and this and then some of the maybe Asian cultures are, I mean, there are more collective society, whereas the self is not really portrayed as an importance there, but the group identity is more emphasized."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So both of those are kind of, I know it's like a long, long but."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I mean, that's the second piece, you know, that's a really interesting thing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I don't know a lot about studies in that realm, but I think there probably are some studies in that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It does seem that there are different, you know, different cultures have different kind of norms around that and certainly in the United States we have this incredible individualistic mentality that I think in some ways is playing out around masks, you know."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "That's what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "We've got this real individual mentality that the individual trumps the, you know, the good."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "The individual is more higher than the good, than the good of the collective."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so that, you know, that's that and I think in some other cultures that's not necessarily the case."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so, you know, I think we do see that playing out and so it's useful again to reflect on and see where is there suffering created by these identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "These, you know, I think that the tools the Buddha offered us are very general, you know, that the tools of looking at how are you identifying, what are you taking to be self, where are you identifying, you know, that and then and then to notice how that's connected with suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So that, you know, that I think that the tools are very general and we we don't and there's some certainly some help I think in in in various cultures in understanding something about, you know, the conditioning of that culture."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's useful to understand what the conditioning of a particular culture is so that we have some understanding about why or how, you know, things have come to be the way they are."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But the key here again is around the suffering, you know, this like is this contributing to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And certain times it might and certain times it might not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And the other piece, yeah, the piece you asked about uncertainty of whether the, you know, that whether it was projection around the being othered or not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "I think that was the question."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Is it, am I really being othered? Or is it my idea of being othered? And I think that's worth being curious about."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "You know, I think, I think it's it's hard, it's hard to know."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But it's, there definitely are, I have definitely seen situations that, you know, somebody somebody would love to not have a particular identity."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "It's just it's being forced on them essentially, you know, so so that it happens that we are othered and we the the example of George Floyd being othered as a black man by the the police officer, you know, that seems seems a very powerful instance of the the othering that the, you know, the the sensing of of danger in the situation or, I don't know, it didn't look dangerous for the police officer, but you know, just something that there is this idea, you know, that that that was a clear sense of danger, you know, and so that there can be, I think, with certain certain situations and identities that that it feels like, well, this is dangerous."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And it's worth honoring that because, you know, in in history or historically, there has been danger in that in that situation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so they're taking care with that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But it is, you know, worth, especially if it's in a situation, maybe where it feels a little bit safer, you know, then it might be it might be worth exploring a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "What if I don't drop the eye on the end of my name? What happens, you know? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "So, you know, I think it is mostly it comes back to exploration and curiosity."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And yet take care of yourself, you know, do do take care to, you know, because some of these patterns around safety are there for a reason, you know, they're there because there has been danger in the past, or danger for for, you know, historically with your community, danger for others who look like you, or who have a name like yours, or for me, danger for a small elderly woman, you know, walking at dark after night, you know, in a particular neighborhood or not, you know, it's like, you know, that I have never had that danger myself."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Personally, I've never been in that situation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "But there's some way in which the collective understanding that there are women of my age of my weight, etc, who have been attacked, that affects me, you know, so it like comes, it comes in through, you know, the conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so there is a way in which I take care that, you know, so that so that that it's not, it's not just imagination, I think."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Yeah, yeah, so it's time to stop."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So, this week we're reviewing again, or going through again, these five qualities of dharma."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "In part, the teachings of the Buddha, the famous saying that we're kind of relying on, is the dharma is well spoken by the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So, something well spoken, beneficial, helpful."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And the dharma, as a teaching, points to something here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And the teaching and what we awaken to are inseparable, what we enter into in this practice is inseparable."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And kind of a simplistic way of saying these five qualities is the first is about the dharma is here, unequivocally here."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "It is, and today, the second one, it is now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The third one is that it's dharma instructs us to look."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The fourth one is flow along."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And the third one is, the fifth one is feel the flowing along, feel the freedom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Know the freedom in this being of flowing along with here and now in the presence."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So, here, now, look, flow along, feel freedom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So, today is now a kaliko."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And it's what's immediate, what's present for us in this present moment, forever long, it lasts for us, the now that we can live in."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And one of the ways to appreciate the value of it is how easy it is to lose touch with it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And meditation is one of the benefits and one of the things to celebrate about meditation is how it shows us how we don't meditate very well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Rather than seeing our ability to not be present as a problem for meditation, meditation is to highlight for us how the mind works and we get to see how much the mind departs the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "One of the ways to do it to see is, you know, the thinking mind."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So, for example, there's a retrospective thinking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "It's hard to think about the past."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "There's anticipatory thinking, thinking about the future."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And you can feel ourselves leaning into those or being, I like to think of them as we're lingering in our thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And as we linger in these thoughts, there's a way in which we no longer linger in the present."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We no longer present for now as it unfolds, as it's present."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so something as simple as being with your breathing, breathing in and breathing out, breathing is always in the present."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And then you can find yourself thinking about something and no longer in touch with the breathing or hardly in touch with it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And you can actually feel the quality of losing touch, of lingering in those thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And those thoughts might feel rich and valuable and important and substantial, but they aren't."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "They are ephemeral, impermanent, changing, fickle."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And it's possible to be so centered in the present together with our thinking that we don't linger in them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "They just feel like loose and light and soft and kind of coterminous with space."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Just thoughts of floating through now, here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We're now tricked into them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We know them as present moment things."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And one of the really wonderful aspects of meditation, as well as mindful meditation, is when there's really a clear, grounding, clear sense that when I'm thinking about the past, the thinking is happening in the present."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "When I'm thinking about the future, the thinking is a present moment phenomenon."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "When I'm involved in fantasy, the fantasy is a present moment phenomenon."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So the repetition of the word now in meditation, just now, or the sense of now, here, now, not to dismiss or deny anything, but to wake up to, oh, this is what the present moment experience is."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We don't have to be at war with our thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We don't have to be at war with thinking about the past and the future."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "But at least in meditation, to discover how much thinking takes us away from the flow, the connection to here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And then learning to wake up to, oh, this is the flavor of now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And the thinking in seeing it this way is now we're not tricked into the living in the past, living in the future and our thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We just see, oh, I'm thinking about it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And maybe we begin feeling the insubstantial nature of thoughts, the lightness of thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Thoughts can feel very heavy and they can feel very light."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "They're not heavy by themselves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "They're heavy by our involvement with them, our lingering in them, our leaning into them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "By themselves, thoughts are very light."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Thoughts are coterminous with space."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "They have as much substance as the sky."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So to come here and be now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And here and now, this is where then we can start recognizing how we obscure or dim or narrow the open sensitivity of our love, of our delight, our appreciation, our friendliness, our love, our care."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And we have such potential now for the beautiful qualities to come out."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And as I said last night in a talk, we get caught up in so many different things in our life that seem so important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And we lose touch so easily with what is most important to be present here for this life with a full attention."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "It might not seem important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "It might seem dull and boring from the point of view of the mind that's spinning and chasing and wanting things and not wanting things and protecting the self."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "It might seem that way, that just being present is not much of interest."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "But to do the thought experiment, that if you know that you have only one hour to live, you're dying."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And maybe you'll be fortunate to die consciously and without any pain."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "But clearly you know you're dying."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And at that time, would you suddenly realize how important it is to go back to your 2009 tax returns because you think you pay too much and you need to fill out paperwork in order to get the $350 back that is yours after all? The last hour of your life, that's not what's the most important thing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The last hour of your life, probably not the most important thing is to start planning vacations."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Planning for the future in some way and anticipating things."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "You realize it's not happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "To that last hour, what's important? And I'd like to propose that to really find the wealth of life, the potential beauty of life, at that time to really know how to be present, to be here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "There's a way in which that hour becomes timeless, that hour is not part of time."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The idea that an hour away you will be dead doesn't have to have any relevance in the fullness of just now, this moment, where love can flow, where delight, where freedom can be, where the heart is not dimmed, where the heart is not obscured, where these thoughts that are heavy don't get in the way, don't interfere."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "But where simply looking out the window and seeing the leaves and the trees blow in the wind can seem like looking at paradise, at jewels."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Not because it is, you've seen it many times before, but the quality of now and presence is so rich and so unobscured and so unencumbered by the things that dim it, that keep it from seeing the sparkle."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So now a kaliko, immediate here, to be seen in this life, to be seen here, to be seen now, this is the Dharma of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so I'd like to recommend that for this day that you carry with you the English word now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And if you want to do some, I like to play word games, letter games, and if you take the first two words of now, no, and think of the W as being the first letter of another word."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So now would stand for no waiting, no waiting, just now, and no wishing, just now, now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So to carry that with you, and not that you're able to stay in the now, but as I said at the beginning of this little talk, this mindful meditation is not so much about being successful and being mindful in the way we might think of being now, but in saying now, seeing more clearly what you are doing now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We're so much an automatic pilot, so much carried away by our thoughts and involved in things."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "We don't really see in some higher quality way what we're actually doing now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So this word now, show up for yourself, see what's happening here."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Don't be an automatic pilot."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And when you're now, what is the most important thing? What would be the most important thing if you had only one more hour to live? And I hope you can do this exercise for many hours."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And I want to make one announcement."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And I'll make it again, but I want to make sure that a number of you can hear it in case you don't come, you're not here when I announce it again."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So for the next three weeks after this week, starting on Sunday, I will be on retreat teaching three week retreat."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so I won't be able to do the 7am."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The last week that I'm away, Matthew Brensilver will come back and teach."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "I wasn't able to find someone for the next two weeks."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "The people are on retreat doing all kinds of things that I normally would invite."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so what we're going to do is to replay the two weeks of these sittings and Dharma talks that I did in December of 2020, a week on loving kindness and a week on compassion."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And I think these are quite important topics."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so I think that the topics are still fresh, even though the talks are almost two years old."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "And so you won't, some of you might not even notice that I'm not here because I think it'll be to be played in a way that looks like it's fresh."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "Though you'll see that I'm younger, maybe longer here or something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (2 of 5) Now is the Most Important Time", "completion": "So thank you and I look forward to tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So this morning will be a little bit more talking than we'll have at, probably we'll have at this time, but just provide a little bit of foundation for our loving-kindness practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But maybe before I jump into that, just a warm-hearted wish today is St."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Meta Day, so wishing all of you, happy Meta Day, and not only all of you, but you know ourselves too."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So Meta, to distinguish it from just maybe this usual word of love that we use so often has two qualities that distinguish it from love, and one is boundlessness, this sense of knowing no boundaries, just being infinite."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And if we're honest, we'll say that well actually our care, our love is usually bounded to our loved ones, or for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Or not, maybe not even including ourselves, and we'll talk about that a little bit as this retreat unfolds, but it's very human that there are some boundaries for our well-wishing, our warm-heartedness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So loving-kindness, Meta has this quality of this immeasurability, infinite, and it certainly is a lofty ideal."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It is possible, but Meta practice is going in that direction, towards me like expanding out, out towards that infinity."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So towards less boundedness, so that's one quality that Meta has that will be cultivating."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And the second is this idea of unconditionality."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Also, if we're honest with ourselves, that we'll notice that very often there are some conditions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I'll love you if you change a little bit, or I'll love myself if I change a little bit, or I can't quite love you the way you are, or something like this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So Meta is also moving towards this quality of unconditionality."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Boundlessness, unconditionality."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So we're moving in that direction, and we move in that direction by cultivating this boundlessness and condition, unconditionality, and we'll be unfolding techniques, instructions that are intended to help cultivate this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Actually, I find it really empowering and beautiful that these can be cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We don't have to wait for just the perfect conditions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We don't have to wait for until we are a certain way, until other people are a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But what the Buddha is pointing to, and these Buddhist teachings are pointing to, is that we can cultivate and develop this so it's available to us now."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And not only that, but this activity of cultivating, until we have completely unconditional and boundless loving-kindness, and we're still of this human tendency to have some conditions or boundaries on our loving-kindness, our well-wishing, our love."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But the activity of cultivating is nourishing for us."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It somehow like feeds our inner life in a way that can be transformative."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Just imagine, what would it be like to be in the world when you feel that you're completely nourished in some kind of way? Of course with food too, we want to be nourished, but just to feel filled up inside, like there isn't a sense of lack."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So this activity of cultivating helps us to feel more settled, more harmonized, more happy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And from this place of happiness, maybe that's not the best word, this sense of contentment, this sense of being filled up, of having enough, transforms the way that we see the world, transforms the way we act in the world."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If we feel like we have enough, then we don't have to get it from elsewhere."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then we can allow others to be how they are, and we can allow things to unfold in a particular way, which allows the goodness to shine through, allows things to unfold in a way that is supportive and honoring others, honoring ourselves, respecting others, respecting ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then our lives unfold in a beautiful way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So we're doing loving kindness practice, met the practice to extend the range of our care, extend the range of our well-wishing, extend the range of our warm-heartedness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And one of the ways that we do this is we start with a narrow place where it's easy, where it's uncomplicated."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And we stay there, really familiarizing ourselves with it, filling ourselves up with it, nourishing ourselves with it as best we can, as best we can."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then we move out from there, and then we move out from there, and move out from there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And every time that we expand this range, Nikki and I will be giving instructions on a particular schedule or, you know, just for teaching purposes, for pedagogical purposes, it may not match."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "In fact, it's likely it won't match exactly what's perfect for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So to honor and respect what's happening for you, let the same time acknowledge that, you know, the instructions come at a particular time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "45 am in the morning, this one's perfect time for you that day to hear new instructions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So to have some flexibility, some malleability, and recognition that all of us will be going at our own pace."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So today, we'll start with the classically is called the benefactor."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We've kind of expanded that to mean that easy being or the lovable being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So this idea of benefactor is some not, you know, maybe it's not so common in our English vocabulary, but it's someone for whom you feel a great amount of gratitude."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And you have an uncomplicated relationship with maybe a heroic figure in your life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Very simple relationship with and you just have this care and love."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Often, this is somebody who really supported us when we were young."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Not always, but it's the easiest person to send well wishing to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's not so uncommon for somebody to say, well, I'm actually sure if I had somebody like that in my life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're going to start where it's easy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "That's the guiding factor here, uncomplicated, simple and easy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Maybe it's even imaginary kittens, puppies, babies."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Sometimes I start there, honestly, with I just feel like, okay, doing that time, but I'm feeling a little bit dry or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I don't, I just have this thing for kittens."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So just starting with you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And sometimes there is an individual where it just feels really easy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So it doesn't have to be the same person every time you're working with the easy being, but the guiding principle here is simple and uncomplicated."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And if it feels like it's too complicated, then choose another being, but not to jump around all the time also, right? That's, we want to be able to settle in, but allow yourself to be maybe playful, lighthearted, maybe a little bit experimental, again, without just jumping all around trying to find the perfect sense, perfect being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "One way to think about it is it says if we were going to build like a campfire, a cozy campfire, and when we're first getting the fire going, we don't bring in a big wet log and plump it down in the middle."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Instead, we start with kindling."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So that's one way to think about this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And there are a whole number of ways in which we can cultivate love and kindness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "There's a whole range and they all have these beautiful qualities to them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But Nikki and I, on this retreat, will be emphasizing three particular aspects, kind of the use of the phrases, visualization, and a sense of the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And for all of us, there'll be maybe one or two of those three that we feel have easier access, is more supportive, perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "You don't have to have all three of these aspects all of the time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then I'll, and then as the days go, we'll be refining and expanding these instructions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But right now, I'm just giving some of the basics to help us get going."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And I'll start with saying a few things about the phrases."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So we're offering phrases that embody this directionality, this intention, this feeling of friendliness, well-wishing, warm-heartedness, metta."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And there are many possibilities for these phrases."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We'll be using specific ones."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "You don't have to use these specific ones if they don't resonate with you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But this is about listening into and tuning into or having sensitivity with these phrases and experiencing the body and see how they resonate or feel."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So what we'll be using is, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, and may you live with ease."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Again, if it doesn't feel meaningful or connected or it's instead of even triggering, then you can modify them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But maybe here's some guidelines."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Keep the phrases general so that 20 years from now, this phrase will still make sense."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And don't, like, unintentionally embed some, like, some amount of fixing, like, may you get a job? I guess that has this kind of implicit something has to get fixed or may your hair grow back or something like that, right? It's more just very general ideas."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And with a sense of spaciousness, with some lightness, gentle, patient, not demanding or insisting."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And here's the last thing I'll say before we'll actually do some meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And that is, have you noticed all emotions, all experiences are impermanent? Of course they are."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's impossible for you to be feeling loving kindness all the time, all during this retreat, all during the meditation period maybe."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So we don't have to get hung up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We don't have to say, oh, this isn't working."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're just creating the conditions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And we don't know which it might arise."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're just planting the seeds, which it might arise, might arise during that meditation period, and might arise later."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It might arise one week from today, one month from today, one year from today."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We are planting seeds with this practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And even if we don't immediately see the sprouts, it's enormously supportive and helpful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And just the activity of cultivating is enormously supportive."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And when it is there, when we do feel this warmheartedness to open to it, allow ourselves to experience it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Okay, so with that as an introduction, we'll do another guided meditation now."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So finding your way into a cluster of ease."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I'm bringing a little blanket around me just to, I don't know, I like kind of the sense of coziness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So there's no reason to sit with that pain or if it's avoidable."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So allowing yourself to use cushions, blankets, shawls."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We'll talk about alternative postures a little bit later this morning."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But right now, taking a posture that's comfortable for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And establishing a sense of the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Like to sit and know you're sitting sensitive to the whole body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Inhabiting the body with awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Keeping the awareness, the attention light will have been sensitive."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Just to see the bodily experience right now."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And when the mind wanders, we just very simply, gently with kindness, bring it back to the experience of having a body at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "At this moment, there's nowhere else to be."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're just here, present for our experience, our bodily experience."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If we notice areas of tightness or tension, is there a way that bringing some awareness to those areas allows them to soften, allows them to release some of their tightness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If the tension or some discomfort is persistent, is there a way in which we can gaze upon it kindly, with some warmth and care."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Being sensitive to the whole body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And maybe having the center of the awareness be in the center of the heart in the middle of the chest, the heart center."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "and then when you feel ready, bringing to mind the lovable being and effect or easy being, staying sensitive to the field of the body, but pulling into the heart and mind, the image, or the sense of the lovable being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Perhaps remembering their goodness or kindness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And begin offering them warmth, kindness, care, and we can use these phrases as a support for that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Practicing in such a way that it encourages a harmonizing, a collecting of this whole being behind the well-wishing, with a sense of lightness, a sense of openness, a sense of ease."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So this idea of being sensitive to the body, visualizing the lovable being in a way that doesn't feel like you have to strain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It doesn't feel like you have to work."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "For some people, it's the easiest."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Just however you are is perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I don't feel like you have to get high definition digital, you know, quality in your visualization, but."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And for today, we're going to work with the lovable being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And we're just going to hang out there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We don't have to get anywhere else."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're just going to do this practice today."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And every relaxed, easy way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "There's a German teacher that she was talking about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "She was talking about mental practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "She used this expression, explore and enjoy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So this idea that we're going for ease and some harmonizing with this well being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But also recognize that we're not just chasing our preferences also."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "We're not just doing whatever."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's not today isn't all about bubble baths and things like this."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But it's, you know, staying with our practice and seeing what resonates how it feels."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And maybe tweaking the phrases if that feels like the right thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And I always start this way with really getting grounded in the body first."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And there will be times in which it feels a little bit dry or maybe I shouldn't say there will be, there might be."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And we just keep with it with the rhythm."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Recognizing that we're planting seeds."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It may not all sprout right then."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then have one announcement."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "That is that tonight at some 15 will be a drop in practice discussion group."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Optional if you feel like it to show up and it'll be an opportunity to ask some questions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And after a day of practice and that you might have some like some questions or some comments you might have."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then tomorrow we'll start the small group practice discussions in the morning."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But today is a day of practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And with that I'll turn it over to Nikki who has some more to say."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Thank you and good day to you all."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I was just reflecting today being Saint Meta Day."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's so auspicious to start a Meta retreat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And also for us to start with the category of dear being, easy being, someone we care about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I mean, it's so sweet to start there in the sense of, I wish you well, I care for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So I love the juxtaposition."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So I'd like to add a few words about walking meditation and also potentially lying down meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "The other postures and standing meditation too."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Many practitioners often think that sitting is where it's at and walking meditation, that's just recess."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "That's what I thought when I was a new meditator at the very beginning."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And actually when I really gave my heart to walking meditation and really connected with it, I fell in love with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I'm still in love with walking meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I see Diana nodding too, yes, thumbs up, yes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And my sitting practice really deepened, really deepened when I connected with walking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And see for yourself actually, see for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "First, you could observe if you don't walk, if you just kind of puddle around your place and then come and sit, how different the quality of mind would be compared to if you actually do a formal meditation, a formal walking practice and then you come sit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "See how different the quality of your mind is, be a scientist of your own mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And the invitation is just to give your heart to walking practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "In fact, one thing that I've shared with a practitioner is before who didn't connect with walking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If that is you, self-identified, not connecting with walking practice, you know who you are."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "There is this idea of arranged marriages and love marriages in some cultures."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And the research actually suggesting that arranged marriages, one gets to love, one gets to really love and explore and appreciate, not in every case, but again, research is looking at percentages and generalities."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So what if instead of you falling in love with walking meditation, what if you consider that for this practice period, for this retreat, you have an arranged marriage with walking practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So you're just going to explore this beloved, this amazing walking practice thing that you have the privilege to just, you know, I've tied the knot for you this morning, yay, the nobcholes of you in walking practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And you're going to explore, you're going to explore just all the beauties, all the goodness, all the characteristics of walking meditation you hadn't quite known before."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So you can be playful about it that way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And I trust that if you do give your heart to it, just like Diana and I have fallen in love with it and many, many other practitioners, you will to find how powerful it is in your practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So in terms of metta and walking, metta and walking practice, you will do the practice of metta, the phrases, the embodiment, bringing the visualization of your whatever category you're working with."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So for today, as you do walking meditation, and you can do walking meditation in the formal and the informal way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And let me talk about both slightly."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "The formal is when you take it about a 10 steps, 10, 20 paces, be indoors in your living space or outdoors, and you walk back and forth, just walk back and forth, which is wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "You can really deepen and connect with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And whenever you turn around, say, at the end of the 10 steps, you stop and turn around, you reconnect with your intention, and that can be really powerful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Say, you start practicing, may you be well, may you be happy, walking with your dear being alongside you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Yeah, you're taking a walk with them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then, oh, you get distracted like, oh, yeah, I haven't talked to them for a while."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "You get to the end of the 10 steps like, wow, I was gone for the past five steps."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's time to reconnect with my intention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Yay, no problem, no judgment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Turn around, reconnect, and then another 10 steps."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So go back and forth, taking a walk with your dear being."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "This is really wonderful to really connect with the practice and for the mind and heart to really settle."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It can also serve as a concentration practice, which we'll say more about later."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Metta also being a Samatha practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Also, it is helpful to take care of your bodies and go for an informal walking meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Please, please do that throughout this retreat, especially if you're being metta."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Go for a walk with your imaginary kittens or imaginary dog."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I love Diana's imaginary kittens."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Or your dear being, imaginary dear being, I remember on a retreat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I was doing a month long dedicated to Brahma Viharas to metta practice and others."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And it was raining outside and I had an umbrella and I was actually doing formal practice at that point."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I was walking back and forth, imagining that I was holding the umbrella for my teacher and benefactor, Venerable Paak Syeda."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So we were walking together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "I was wishing him well, protecting him from the rain."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Still have the felt sense memory of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So see how it works for you to bring your dear being and wish them well, protect them perhaps from the elements if it's raining or chilly where you are."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then if you walk outside again, feel free to take a walk, but keep the phrases, keep the dear being with you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And also if you are aware, you know, you can have your gaze down, you could have your gaze up, it's okay, see what is needed."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If your mind is really distracted, you can have your gaze down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And if there's a sense of stability, stability, then you can actually, your eyes can be open."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If there are passerbys, you can share your meta with a smile."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's quite lovely to do that actually on a meta retreat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And then in a couple of minutes remaining, I wanted to also talk about standing practice, which please feel free when it says sitting, meditation, the sit period."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "If you're back, your body needs it, you can also stand and practice in standing position."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "The Buddha taught four postures, sitting, standing, walking, and lying down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And now it's to lying down, which doesn't get much attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But on a meta retreat, especially if your body needs care, if your back needs care, and it's a time when you're not feeling very sleepy, please feel free to explore lying meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "In fact, I've had so many body issues that I've done a lot of practice in my life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "My deepest practice I've done lying down and my mind has learned not to fall asleep."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "It's actually a very supportive state where the mind body can relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "But if you realize, wow, hypnagogic state images are coming, kind of getting foggy, then open your eyes or get up so that more energy comes in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "You have to be more aware, your awareness has to be sharpened."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Some people also like to have their hand, their arm at a 90-degree angle when they're lying down so that if they get sleepy, it falls on them or just straight up so that it falls down if they get sleepy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And again, take care, take care."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "And taking care again isn't always saying bubble bath all day, but it's take care of wisdom with compassion."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Wisdom with compassion and with awareness, not tuning out, but with awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "How can you balance your body, your mind, your heart, your cultivation? And as today is a day of practice, for the couple of sessions this morning, the practice sessions, and also this afternoon too, myself and Tanya will offer some very light guidance, some very light guidance today to offer just a little more support."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Not too much talking so there's plenty of silence, but it's the first day just to kind of bring us back together, bring us back together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "So with that, I wish you a wonderful 45 minutes of walking period."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to metta meditation", "completion": "Yay, go enjoy exploring and see you soon."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "If the bell doesn't go, it means the practice hasn't ended, right? In this same spirit I've been talking about during this couple of days, as this time of our little community winds down at last time together, we'd encourage everyone to be considering things in this way."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Just because the bell rings doesn't mean that we stop practicing, doesn't mean that anything has changed in terms of the attention that we pay to each moment, but rather it's just a change of mode."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We're in retreat, we're not in retreat, informal practice, formal practice."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Things change their modes, they change their style, their form, but the dharma remains the same and the importance of paying attention remains the same."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Many years ago I had planned to walk the length of England from Chidhurst Monastery down in the south, Sussex, all the way up to a new branch monastery in Northumberland, far north on the Scottish border."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "There's a journey with a winding route and about 800 or so miles."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "I've been planning for many months, built my own sandals, made many training walks and preparations, and then the morning that myself and my walking companion, Nick Scott, leaving from Chidhurst Monastery, I just made a very simple and potent reflection."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "He said, actually there's nobody going anywhere, there are just conditions of mind that are changing."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "This was a very helpful, beautiful reflection of the mind so fixed on me going somewhere, but we've got 830 miles ahead of us."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "All these places, all these people, all this time, but in that simple phrase he pointed out people, time, places, these are all mental constructs, location, selfhood, time, these are all conditioned patterns of perception, they arise and pass away within our awareness."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "It takes shape, different patterns of consciousness, it is all, and they all happen here."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "There's nobody going anywhere, there are just conditions of mind that are changing."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Regardless of whether the location says IRC outside of Santa Cruz, San Francisco Airport, PDX Airport, Portland, where I'm due to fly to today."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The perception of PDX, feelings, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, arising and passing away, IRC, sound, feeling, sight, arising and passing away, they all happen here."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "As the time proceeds and midday comes and all the cleaning tasks are finished, you say all your goodbyes, have a closing circle, reconnecting with Gil and each other, vehicles go in all sorts of different directions, down to Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Los Angeles, Reno, San Francisco, Berkeley, Mendocino, wherever the vehicles go, they're known within consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Patterns of perception coming and going, changing, Reno is a perception in the mind, Watsonville is a perception in the mind, a Byagiri monastery, Aranya Bodhi Hermitage, perceptions arise and pass away, they all happen here, they're known here and when we see the world happens in our mind, the heart attunes itself to Dhamma, it attunes itself to that fundamental timeless still, spacious, natural, non-personal quality, being that very knowing, that Vijaya, that awakened awareness, the stillness that knows the flowing of the water, the ending of becoming, but by stopping the flow, but by attuning to that dimension, which is free from time, free from place, free from individuality, from separateness, from birth and death, unborn, and dying, unlimited."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "One time a devatar came to the Buddha and said, when I was a human being, in my last life, I was a yogi, and I made the vow to spend my life giving value to the journey to the end of the world, even to the extent of developing psychic powers so I could fly through the air, I was a skywalker, as it says in the scripture, but no matter how far I journeyed, I couldn't come to the end of the world, I never reached the end of the world."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The Buddha responded by saying, it's true, you can never reach the end of the world by walking, but I tell you, until you reach the end of the world, you'll never reach the end of dukkha, of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The end of the world is not a big precipice, it's not the destruction of the planet, the end of the world is the realisation of that timeless, unlimited, unborn, undying, completely liberated aspect of our own being, which is already here, has never been anywhere else than right at the very centre of our life, but we miss it, because we're so busy with time, things, our to-do list, our successes, our failures, our gains, our losses, praise, criticism, so busy that we miss what's already here, we forget."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "This little time of retreat is also a big time, we call it little, small, brief, just a couple of days, but we can also see it as being vast, huge, two and a half days, nearly three whole days, or those opportunities to look into our own heart, to find what's here, all this time, so awakened to the timeless."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Buddha Dhamma is a teaching of personal responsibility, it's not a teaching based on getting zapped by a guru from outside, receiving grace from the divine up above, it's a teaching of personal responsibility, personal effort, you have to do the rescuing, someone who's in the role of teaching or guiding can point out the way, but each one of us has to listen, to internalise those instructions, to learn the map, just like I now can find my way from the shrine room back to my room without getting lost, I feel a great sense of achievement."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "There's the twists and turns of the way through the building, up to us to learn, it's not going to just be done to us, we might dream of having an implant that can just slot in behind your ear and then all your troubles fall away and enlightenment arrives, but I don't think it'll be this year, it's a teaching of personal responsibility, personal effort, so even if the teacher is not around, the formal retreat is over, back on the freeway, the retreat doesn't have to be over, the jitviveka, the internal seclusion can still carry on, I have to catch a plane today, so I have to step down in a few minutes time and Gil will step up, the mind might say oh well it's all over now, might as well just get in the car and go, everybody else can look after the wrap-up, the tidy-up, Ajahnamma is gone, yeah not really worth bothering with the rest, Gil, Shmilp, this is called wrong view, and with extremely nasty karmic consequences I'm sure, like Ajahn Chow would often say, don't just be a well-behaved monk when the Ajahn's around and when the Ajahn's not there, don't think that nobody's watching, because you are watching, you know what you're doing, you know where the mind is going, you know what the mind dwells upon, you know, it's our mind, our life, it's for us, we're not doing this to be serving an institution, to be paying obeisance to a method, out of obligation, or compulsion, or superstition, it's for us, it's for you, so just because the voice changes, the practice continues, it's because the venue changes, the practice continues, formal informal, the practice continues, quiet and serene, well-protected, safe, fragrance-free, or unprotected, stinky, agitated, rude, freeway behaviors that we have to deal with from others who are not keeping the precepts, cutting us off, giving us the finger, the practice continues."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The world is not polite, Lumpur Cha would say, sickness and death have no manners, they just show up and kick the door in and they never even waited for an invitation, life is rude, things happen, we get injuries, people insult us, our projects fall apart, illnesses arrive, people that we love turn away from us, the practice continues, things all come together, our stock goes through the ceiling, suddenly everything is easy, beautiful, we can move to that perfect place we've always wanted, help fund the retreat centre, send Gil on holiday to England, the practice continues."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "If we're wise, whether things are bitter or sweet, delightful or difficult, the practice continues, whether you're on the retreat and the Ajahn is watching you, Gil is giving you personal advice, or whether you're back home in your sitting room, all by yourself in your little meditation room, bored out of your mind after seven minutes on the cushion, practice continues, this is how we really develop, this is how we make the most of our opportunity as a human being, this precious, beautiful human life of ours."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "If we bring that inquiring mind, that inquisitive, reflective attitude, then everything will teach us, out on the freeway being insulted, serene in the shrine room, home with our cat sitting on our lap, everything will teach us, bitter loneliness left by yourself on a cold wet winter day, beautiful serene time, there's dear companions, everything will teach us if we let it, if we bring that inquisitive, reflective mind, ask what is this teaching me, what can I learn from this, what blessings does this bring, and it's right there, the teaching, the dumbest, right there, right here, without fail."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "And when we consider the quality of 90% of the non-attachment or non-entanglement, I encourage everyone to recollect that non-attachment also involves participation."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Vijja and Charana go together, awareness and activity."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "They go together, they're a pair."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So when we're endeavoring to practice non-attachment, see how that manifests in terms of fulfilling our responsibilities."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Rather than, it's all empty, I'm practicing non-attachment, I'm going to go home and leave you to do the cleaning."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "I'm practicing non-attachment, therefore, how can I help with the cleaning? Our non-attachment or non-entanglement, non-grasping of life manifests as a attentive, unselfish, mindful participating."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Duty not as a sense of pressurized obligation, but just serving the moment."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "What's needed? How can I help? If something needs to be done, and with a heart of non-attachment, non-entanglement, we step forward to join in to help out."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "If there's nothing to be done, then we leave it alone."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Not trying to make ourselves busy as some sort of misguided attempt at virtue."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We're developing a naturally responsive heart."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Sometimes it's even more difficult to leave things alone, to not be busy, than to join in and help out."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "But responsibility involves both of those."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "When there's something to do, to join, to engage with a good heart, there's nothing to do."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We can leave the moment undefined."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We can leave our sense of being undefined."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "In terms of helping to sustain this attitude of citta viveika, internal seclusion, non-entanglement, the structure of the precepts, the five precepts, is a very clear and helpful framework for living."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "When the retreat finishes, midday to day, I suspect Gil will give the opportunity for people to determine the five precepts as a way of carrying this same spirit forth."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "As the vehicles start rolling, we separate and this little community comes to its natural conclusion."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The precepts are your own portable retreat."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "They are what you can take with you."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "They create an environment of spiritual engagement."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "They support the attitude of wakefulness, the attitude of friendliness, compassion, harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Even if others are behaving disrespectfully towards you or dishonestly towards you, aggressively towards you, there's nothing in the universe that compels us to act in the same way."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The framework of the five precepts helps us to sustain an environment of security, to protect our own heart and also it offers a standard to others."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "You're not supporting those destructive and foolish behaviors."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "That's a beautiful and helpful example for those around us."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "How much peace we feel, how much more easeful life is when we haven't got to protect a lie, to sustain an untruth."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "During these few days, I've spoken a lot about letting go of feelings of self, self-centered thinking, attitudes, and the natural counterpart to that self-use, self-centered thinking, Sakaya Diti."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "As that falls away, what rises up in its place is a sense of gratitude, gratefulness for those around us."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "As we stop fixating, obsessing about me, my life, my feelings, my practice, my preferences, my space, as that I and me and mine is seen as transparent, void of substance, the heart broadens and opens."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We begin to appreciate what we are receiving and those around us, the world around us, the living environment, the people who help us along the way."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So as self-concern diminishes and falls away, what rises up is gratefulness."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So, at the end of a retreat time like this, it's very appropriate that that's gratefulness blossom, that it be conscious."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Grateful to Gil and all those who gathered together and had the vision to create this space, gratefulness for the people who've been putting their efforts into creating all the delicious foods, those amongst us who've been looking after the registrations, administration, caring for people's ailments."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So rather than just fixating on what I've got out of this retreat or what more I could get out of the retreat, what I like, what I don't like, we take these last few hours that we have together to let that gratefulness be conscious and then to let it bear fruit to blossom in terms of offering your own assistance, helping to tidy up, to help out, to express appreciation, to lend a hand so that your practice of realization of not-self, non-attachment manifests in the most practical and helpful, as beautiful ways, as an expression of sangha."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "When the Buddha mind sees the way things are, when the Buddha sees the dhamma, what results is sangha."}

{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So if we really want our wisdom, the wisdom and clarity of mind that's been developed in these few days, for that to be fulfilled, then let it manifest as sangha."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "The Buddha awakened to the dhamma and what arose was the sangha."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "When the Buddha wisdom of your own mind sees the way things are in your life, let that also manifest in the same way as unselfish activity."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Love of good company rejoicing in the presence of like-minded spiritual companions."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Harmony in the sangha, Buddha pointed out, is most precious, beautiful, important of qualities."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Let's rejoice in that, celebrate that."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So in a moment I'm going to ring the bell."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "Please don't think, now the practice is finished."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "You can think that, but no, just as a thought and just to see the mode of our practice together is just changing, taking a different shape."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "So myself and other monastics will chant some blessings as a way of saying farewell and then we'll get up and depart."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We need to be getting in our van and rolling by 9."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "30 so we need to confine all the farewells to the minimum."}
{"prompt": "Closing Talk: We Leave, but the Practice Remains", "completion": "We'll offer some blessings and share the goodness of this time with each other."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And today, continuing this thread of the exploration of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the instructions basically that the Buddha offered, some of the key meditation instructions that the Buddha offered to cultivate mindfulness are collected in this Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's not quite clear whether the Buddha actually gave this Sutta as one discourse or not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There are different views on that, different perspectives on that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But they are collected in the Sutta in the middle-length discourses."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The instructions of mindfulness are collected."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And I'm just going to offer a little bit of, today I want to just mostly offer kind of an overview of the Third Foundation, my kind of takeaways on the Third Foundation, and then in the next few weeks offering a little more diving into particular aspects of it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But first, I want to just speak kind of more generally about how we can see the Satipatana Sutta as a whole, the Buddha's instructions on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "For establishments of mindfulness, another way to translate that word Satipatana, Sati meaning mindfulness, and the Patana part having various kind of translations, let's say, that sometimes means foundation or something you stand on."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Standing with is another way to translate it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So mindfulness standing with is another way to look at it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the establishing or kind of setting up a setting that it can be not so much the foundation itself, but the setting up of so the establishing of the state of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so there's a lot of exercises in the Satipatana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "One of the foundations has different instructions, the foundation of mindfulness of the body has a number of different ways in to exploring present a moment awareness with the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness of feeling, instructions on how to be aware of that simple aspect of experience, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness of mind is more this one way to look at it is this kind of looking at the quality or the flavor of the mind that is observing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That I kind of pointed to in the guided meditation that as we observe something, something's arising here, a sound, a sight, a body sensation, and then there's there can be a flavor in the mind that likes it that doesn't like it that's at ease with it that's confused about it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So there's, there's that quality in the mind in relationship to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is kind of one way to understand the foundation, different aspects of exploring that and the fourth foundation, having, I think it's seven different areas of exploration around different teachings that the Buddha offered, kind of understanding our experience through a Dharma framework, we could say that fourth foundation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And all of these different exercises, each exercise actually each mindfulness exercise can kind of be understood from different ways."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It might be understood as a kind of a kind of an instruction, okay, pay attention to this now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And some people look at the Satipatanasuta as a whole as a kind of a staged deepening of exploration in different areas of experience starting with the body, the body being the most obvious kind of experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So an easy way into connecting with experience and then feeling tone, kind of being a bridge between body and mind, because there's feeling tone associated with physical experience and with mental experience, feeling tone itself being a mental experience but we have connection with the sense of feeling tone being that there is a feeling associated with our physical experience as well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the feeling tone kind of being a little bit of a subtler exploration, we might start with body and then kind of a tune to the feeling of the feeling tone in the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And that being a bridge into noticing that there are feeling tones in the mind as well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's kind of a deepening of that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the third foundation looking at the quality of the mind, how the mind is in relationship to experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the whole of the four foundations of mindfulness can be looked at as kind of start with the body, then once you've got that kind of settled then you can attune to the feeling tones of experience and then get a little bit more interested in how the mind is, etc."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So it can kind of be looked at in that way of a deepening set of practices."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It can also be looked at as a whole, in terms of different ways to establish mindfulness, you could establish mindfulness through being connected with body, or for some people it might be easier to establish mindfulness being connected to mental experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So one might be looked at as disparate kind of exercises, where you can direct attention to various areas of experience, depending on what is more natural for you perhaps so body perhaps maybe an easy place to kind of land starting there directing attention to the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Or for some, I know, you know, some people found it much easier in their early practice to be aware of what was going on in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so, you know, not having to start with the body necessarily but just establishing mindfulness with what was going on in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so the they could be looked at not necessarily as okay first having to do the body and then move on to the next one but just looking kind of more at well what where is it easy for you to connect and connect there and giving a little bit of instruction on how to connect in that that sphere."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Another way, though, to look at the the instructions in the Satipa Tanasuta is not so much as direct your attention to this area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There, there are, you know, instructions that say, you know, in the foundation of feeling, for instance, the instructions are are more kind of receptive in a way they say when one is experiencing a pleasant feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "One knows one is experiencing a pleasant feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's the kind of instruction there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't say look for experience that's pleasant and then be aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And this kind of says, notice what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And, and recognize it from this perspective."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, what's happening right now there's pleasant there's unpleasant there's neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "What's happening right now is it pleasant know that it's pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Is it unpleasant know that it's unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And the foundation of the mind is very similar to that the language there is when you read a section of it, one understands a mind affected by greed is a mind affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And one understands a mind unaffected by greed is a mind unaffected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So again, it's got that flavor of just what's happening and knowing that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So these instructions in the Satipa Tana can be looked at as you know you might you might kind of explore for a time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay, I'm going to choose to kind of attune to an area like I'm going to attune to the area of feeling and just not pay attention to physical sensation and per se right now but just more what the feeling tone is."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So not so much attending to the bodily experience but more the feeling tone which may be associated with bodily sensation but may also be associated with mental sensation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the the exercises in the Satipa Tana Sutra can be looked at another kind of way to kind of talk about them is either as kind of instructions of pay attention to this now, or as more descriptions of what things you might notice when you open to your experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So I don't think we have to look at one or the other of these perspectives as being right."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But just that I really feel that these instructions offer a variety of ways for people to attune to being present."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And in some ways the ambiguity there can be supportive for us because all minds, every mind is different in terms of how it relates to experience and for some minds it's easier to choose to pick something to be attentive to."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And for some minds that's a kind of a way in and for other minds it's much easier to kind of settle back and and not have to kind of hold the attention on a particular area."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So often in in meditation practice when I'm speaking to people about their practice I will say with meditation go with what's easiest and most natural for you start with with your easy doorway in that that is the place to begin to cultivate mindfulness for you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So if it's easier for you to be with one experience like the breath to start start there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "If it's easier and easier doesn't necessarily mean always more continuous but but kind of more that the mind is more relaxed and available to know what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, so I think these instructions can be really tuned in a way to each person individually."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's really up to us to understand and to know what is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This third foundation that I want to speak to today a little bit more, I think really does help us to kind of home hone in on that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "What is helpful, because it does point to this kind of how are we in relationship to experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The third foundation is looking at is greed aversion delusion delusion present or absent in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so that kind of beginning to become aware and talked a little bit about greed aversion and delusion last week, just in a very kind of over overall way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That that kind of familiarity of how the mind whether the mind has kind of that kind of contracted or kind of that tight quality of wanting something a reactive quality to what's happening I need to hold on to this I need to push this away."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The wanting to hold on being the greed the wanting to push it away being aversion, or some idea or belief around what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It should be this way it shouldn't be this way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know those kinds of ideas or views, not necessarily that the ideas or views are are unhelpful sometimes views can be very helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But when we don't know their views."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's the place where it begins to slip into delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so the, the kind of being aware of the quality in the mind helps us to begin to understand so that you know this kind of difference in the mind when the mind is affected by greed aversion delusion when it's not affected by greed aversion delusion beginning to get familiar with that difference."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We begin to understand when the mind is kind of more trustable."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When the mind is more able to meet experience without reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There's no that that the teachings point us to that being the way towards freedom from suffering to ease of heart and mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's very clear when we notice that difference when we begin to recognize the difference between a mind that's affected by greed and the mind that's not affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The mind affected by aversion the mind not affected by aversion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's really clear when we notice that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That the mind affected by greed and aversion is a mind that is experiencing suffering right then and there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And the mind that is not affected by not by greed and not affected by aversion that mind is."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There is an ease and a piece there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There's a kind of a space there's space to reflect on what's happening from a perspective of wisdom from a perspective of compassion from a perspective of connection rather than rejection."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the this this third foundation and it begins to point us to this understanding what's helpful and what's not helpful in terms of the mind moving in the direction of ease and peace."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's it's that lens that the Buddha really that was his own question really is what is it possible for us to be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And the suffering when he looked into his own mind and explored this what what does it mean for a mind to suffer he found these qualities of greed aversion and delusion to be completely tied up connected with that experience of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "He he pointed to that in and in some places he said, pleasant experience unpleasant experience, those are going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We often think of pleasant experiences not suffering and unpleasant experiences suffering, but the Buddha created a distinction there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "He said pleasant unpleasant, those can happen we do not have to suffer."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "If pleasant experience is slipping away."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We do not have to suffer if unpleasant experience is arising the relationship in the mind how the mind is in relationship to that experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's where we will suffer or not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so this third foundation kind of points us to begin to understand what is it in the mind what does it feel like when the mind has more space what does it feel like when the mind is not contracted around wanting things to be a different way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And what does it feel like when it is contracted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So this this third foundation has two kind of sections to it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This first section talking about the presence and absence of greed aversion delusion just just really simply one understands a mind affected by greed is a mind affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "One understands a mind affected by aversion is a mind affected by aversion in this suit actually largely in the in the teaching of the four foundations of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It is appointing to just noticing what's happening rather than trying to change what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So there's not an instruction in here for instance it says when greed is arising we understand that greed is arising."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't offer in this suit and other places in the in the text it does offer other things you might do if the mind is kind of being pulled into to its reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This suit it just simply points to awareness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't give antidotes in the suit."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So it doesn't say when the mind is affected by greed here's what you do to get rid of it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It says when the mind is affected by greed you understand that it's affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "What's a little doing there you know it's a little doing that understanding is a different way of meeting greed arising in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Normally when something like greed is arising in the mind that greed is motivating us to take action based on what it desires."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So there's something happening some experience or some sensation or some something happening in the world that we like that we want that we want to hold on to that we want to continue."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And that that's often what the motivation of greed happens."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Usually or before we get this kind of teaching what our mind does when it's affected by greed is it follows the beliefs of greed which is I need to get that thing in order to be okay."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I need to have that thing in order to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so that's our habitual response to greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so understanding that the mind is affected by greed is simply is not is not following that movement."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But the awareness of greed is arising right now this is what it feels like to be a human being experiencing wanting this to be mine."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's a different perspective."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Another piece about that that's important to highlight here is that it is possible for us to be aware of a mind affected by these reactive tendencies."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That is that the mind can know without following it, it can be aware of that experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is what it's like to feel like I'm being pulled towards something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is what it's like to have this resistance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the experience of resistance often, you know, felt physically can be felt physically we feel that kind of pulling back or retreating from something when there's a version."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so that that the mind can understand that can know that sometimes sometimes people their teachings are understood."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There's a there's a kind of a teaching in in the Buddhist psychology that in a moment when mindfulness is present."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Why is mindfulness is present there will not be greed aversion or delusion present."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so sometimes that is that is taught from the perspective of Buddhist psychology."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And but what you need to understand in that in the Buddhist psychology teaching is that moment a moment of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's arising that does not contain a moment of aversion, you know that understanding they can't simultaneously exist."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That mind moment is so vanishingly small."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It said there are something like 17 trillion in the blink of an eye."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so in one blink of an eye, 17 trillion mind moments, maybe half of them are mindful and half of them have a version."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The experience there is it feels like we know it together."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so we don't have to try to separate all those mind moments out."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The Buddha didn't actually speak about mind moments in this way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "He talked about understand a mind affected by greed is a mind affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So in the Sutta realm and the teachings that the Buddha offered, he speaks about being able to be aware of these reactive states of mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's not being pulled into the reactive states of mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's knowing them and knowing how they affect us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And that effect, you know, kind of, I think I said this a few minutes ago, that when we feel, I did."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When we feel greed aversion arising in the mind and understand it as greed arising in the mind, we understand it as painful in that moment, as suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We feel the constriction around it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We feel the rub with reality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, so we feel that kind of kind of rub and that kind of denial of that's what's happening in experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So it's like, what's arising right now is what's arising right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And the mind that comes into alignment with that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's like, yep, this is what's arising right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That mind can have more of the sense of ease of non greed, non aversion, non delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "In the first half of the suit, there's another pair."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It speaks about the, there's four pairs of kind of contrasting qualities, let's say in the first half of this section of the suit and contemplation of mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "How does one abide contemplating mind as mind when understands a mind affected by lust or greed as affected by greed as unaffected by greed is unaffected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And then affected by aversion, not affected by aversion affected by a delusion, not affected by delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The fourth pair in this first section is understands contracted mind as contracted mind and distracted mind as distracted mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Now this one is interesting because the first three kind of point to opposites, you know, there, there, there's a whole, an unwholesome and wholesome quality affected by greed, not affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Not affected by greed, kind of being moving in the direction of the wholesomeness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So we might understand the absence of greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's an important thing to notice in this first section that we're noticing the presence or absence of unwholesome qualities in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And in noticing the presence of unwholesome qualities, we feel the pain of that in noticing the absence of unwholesome qualities."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "We feel the kind of spaciousness of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This fourth pair contracted and distracted doesn't seem to have this kind of wholesome unwholesome quality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The commentaries say these are both in the unwholesome realm."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "They're connected, the commentaries connect them to the hindrances of sloth and torpor for contracted mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The mind that just kind of sinks in and the distracted mind to the restless mind, the mind that kind of has trouble in the landing on things."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There are different perspectives on that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But, but I think Biquinaleo is the main one who points out that perhaps those could be understood as contrasting opposites that maybe contracted mind actually refers to concentration and distracted mind refers to not concentration."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Maybe, you know, concentrated and not concentrated or discussed later in the sutta."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, but in any case, what I have found personally is this pair of contracted and distracted is a really useful kind of simple way to touch into how the mind is in relationship to something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Is it kind of wrapped internally when it's when it's in relationship in a way that's that's kind of a struggle."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, sometimes we might know that the mind is kind of wrapped internally but not be so clear whether it's aversion or greed or delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Just that's kind of sense of, you know, pulled in or sometimes we have a sense of the mind jumping all over the place like trying to organize the world that kind of distracted quality that the quality of the mind being very jumpy and that restless quality basically."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know that that for me that kind of noticing of those is a very simple way to kind of remember oh yeah the mind is in this kind of is in a kind of a reactive state it's either kind of pulled inward so contracted or it's kind of scattered outwardly distracted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That has been a really helpful tool in my own practice, and I add for myself I add the kind of the opposite it's like well it's not contracted right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Is it not contracted meaning it's scattered well no it's maybe it's neither contracted or scattered."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And there is that spaciousness that landing with experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's a that I find that one to be an interesting one experientially to explore you know what does it mean for you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "If the mind feels contracted or in that quality of being pulled inward and putting up the wall of the barrier between yourself and the world."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Or is it kind of like out there trying to arrange the world so that it's okay you know to be me and this body right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know that kind of jumping so those are those are some really useful tools to explore."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So I'll just mention a little bit about the second half and we'll go into that a little bit more detail, some weeks from now it may be you know."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The second part of the suit that really kind of talks about a being aware more of wholesome qualities and the absence of some wholesome qualities and the lens is more focused on concentration and insight in my understanding."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The language is a little different the language is is unfamiliar to us perhaps the pairs of opposites that are used, except for perhaps concentration."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The translation says one understands exalted mind is exalted mind and unexalted mind is unexalted mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay, you know it's like when I first read this like got no clue you know what does that mean surpassed mind is surpassed mind and unsurpassed mind is unsurpassed mind concentrated mind is concentrated unconcentrated is unconcentrated and liberated mind is liberated mind and unliberated mind is unliberated mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the commentaries give us a little bit of help here and we'll go into this a little more in in a few weeks, but that the first couple of or the first three."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The first one in particular I think is is kind of referring to a states different different states of concentration exalted mind perhaps being the mind that's a that is in that state of jhana, you know that state of deep concentration."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So kind of a movement into that area that the mind is really secluded from reactivity, not forever, but for the moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So understanding that the mind is in that place surpassed mind and unsurpassed mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That one to me you know that one."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes they speak about that being sense fear consciousness or formless consciousness you know that's one way that the suit to speak of the commentary speak about it that are we in a kind of a normal everyday ordinary sense of awareness of awareness in our sense sense body, or is the mind in a state of the what are called sometimes the formless states the states of mind where the mind is absorbed into states of awareness solely of space or consciousness or vast vastness without being connected to the sense fear so there's a those are sometimes called the formless Janas that I've not experienced those except in you know brief moments."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes the mind can drop into those through mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's how I've experienced them occasionally."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that but they can be cultivated through deep concentration practice and kind of entered into more reliably for people who have that facility."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But they are some of these these formless states are are simply states of mind that can be known and occasionally through continuity of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So one can kind of notice them for moments at a time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's been my experience in those in that in that realm."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so these these the second set is kind of we could say the takeaway maybe is noticing that the mind has entered into wholesome states and then noticing the absence of them noticing when the mind is in a state of insight, the, the liberated mind and the unliberated mind is said to be not not full liberation but just the mind absent of the mind in a space of freedom for a moment, either through concentration or insight."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So these these last four are again a kind of about noticing whether the mind is in a space of more freedom concentration seclusion from reactivity, or not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And now we can go into this in more depth in in in a few weeks this is kind of a complex section of the suit."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I thought of bringing in, but it's fallen out of my mind right now, it'll come back sometime."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the the last piece is that, as with all the instructions, every single meditation instruction in this suit has a section on kind of pointing to that this contemplation can be done in our own experience or in kind of contemplating others."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So we might also, you know, the internal external contemplation can be interesting."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so I'm going to start with this now it does have to be inferential in the in the realm of of awareness of mind, we can't directly know what somebody else's mind is doing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's a way that there may be I mean, when somebody is yelling us and their faces contorted in anger, often we feel that you know there's a kind of a resonance."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that that that we can be aware that anger is arising externally the anger is arising in that being."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes and you may have noticed this sometimes I find this happens for me on retreat, where I may be, you know, be doing some walking meditation and I see somebody else doing walking meditation and it's like I feel their mind state, the kind of the quality of continuity of mindfulness that's apparent in, or seems to be apparent, you know, I don't know, you know, but there is a way in which not only our states of greed, you know, an anger kind of contagious, but states of continuity of mindfulness can also be contagious and we can be aware of, of how somebody how somebody else seems to be."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So the the internal and external contemplation encourages us to not only be aware of our own experience, but aware of the experience of others."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And we're also encouraged to be aware of how these states arise and pass away the impermanent nature of them that it's not that when the state of aversion is arising, it's not forever."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's something that arises independence on condition and passes independence conditions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so there's this encouragement to kind of be curious about a broader range of things happening around these qualities in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, yeah, there's a little bit of time for questions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I'll just say that I think that the area, the first area, the, you know, the first half that mind affected by greed aversion delusion or not, and the contracted distracted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I do want to go into that more in the coming weeks so there'll be we'll have more time to discuss that in the coming weeks."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I'll just let's open it up for for comments or questions or clarifications or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And you're welcome to unmute yourself."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You've been talking about this being aware."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Are we in a state of greed or aversion or delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And how would we practice that on an ongoing basis in our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "One, I mean, I've been asking this as I've been listening to you and the only thing that came to me today."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "I hadn't thought of anything prior was just, if there's any time I'm suffering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Do you have any other suggestions because you know, life just kind of goes by and we go through the day and then when I'm sitting yes I can notice, especially if I have body paints that there's a version going on."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And I can notice if I'm clinging to mind states right, but otherwise I'm mostly focusing on letting go right and just being being an awareness so any suggestions for daily life."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And outside of formal sitting you mean right."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So a couple one is that this practice it does take a little bit of kind of doing to remember."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "How am I in relationship to experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so, you know, just whenever you remind think about it and, and sometimes having some cues is useful so you know, sufferings happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "That's how the mind is in relationship."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "If there's suffering happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "There is greed aversion or delusion going on in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, so, you know, so or contraction distraction, you know, and again that contraction distraction piece I found an easy one in in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, it's a sign of suffering too."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, it's simpler in some way than is this great as a subversion it's like wrapped in crazy trying to figure things out."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, so sometimes I find that one easier in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Oh contracted or distracted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And again remembering when you notice it is just like oh yeah contracted is happening or, or, or scattered is happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You don't have to try to fix it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But you know just that awareness can create a bigger space in which perhaps you're not being driven by that mind state."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And to do what it's asking us to do or to do what it's demanding us to do you know they have a kind of urgency to us those reactive mind states."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so, you know, when we can see them sometimes that urgent feeling maybe gets a little bit of space it's like oh yeah that's what's going on as the mind's kind of crazily trying to figure something out."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, so, so having having some cues you know yes I'm suffering and then keeping it simple I think can be helpful in that time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's like okay well you know what is what is what is happening here how is the mind in relationship to this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And then, I think to another piece of it is the more you kind of orient in that way, the more natural it becomes, you know, so at first it does take a little bit of remembering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know like oh what is my relationship you know I have to step back and that is a feeling often it's like often our minds is focused on something, you know the object, and the feeling of checking the relationship is kind of a feeling of stepping back and how am I not focused on the object and how is the mind with this so so it's a kind of an opening quality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so it, it, it, as we get used to that as we kind of get familiar with that experience of stepping back and noticing it can become almost second nature."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So in time it gets much easier."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And like that now I don't have to think about it as much anymore."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's it's almost like it's it's second nature as suffering arises you and often it is with suffering as suffering arises like oh yeah."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So, you know having those cues is a great way to begin to make it more natural."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So at first we do have to do it, but it does become easier over time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So there's a couple more places or cues that I find useful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When I teach this on retreat I often say there's three good times to check you know it's like from time to time it's useful to check the attitude, but there's three kind of really useful times."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When you're suffering is the first one."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When you think it's going really well you know if you notice that there's a lot of happiness going on if you notice that the mind is just like floating through life you know, check the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And it might be that there's some subtle greed there, you know that there's some subtle like oh yeah I want to make this continue or oh I'm doing it right or figured it out or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So there could be some greed or delusion embedded in that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Or and we could say and also a possibility is that there isn't some reactivity there's some subtle greed there and what's being missed is the recognition."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the experience of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the experience of non greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the experience of non delusion you know that so so you know so when it's going well is actually an opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And you know plenty of times when I've noticed that it's going well I've seen that subtle kind of holding on or fear that it's going to go away if I just become mindful of it or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But many times as I become aware of this is like oh yeah, the mind is at ease right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So it opens us to that part to so noticing the attitude of mind is not just about noticing the greed aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's also about noticing the non greed the non aversion the non delusion the state of of ease of peace of of spaciousness of non contractedness of non scattered."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's another one is that that kind of notice when it feels like it's going well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know sometimes that one is actually harder to remember to check in with because we get hooked into that you know or or it's like the mind just thinks don't need to worry about this you know it's like it doesn't really think about connecting with."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Can I be aware of this state."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "It's kind of floating in it and that's a subtle kind of delusion in a way that it's a subtle non awareness of even the wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "The third one and this maybe is more is easier in sitting meditation but can be used in daily life practice at times."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When you return from being lost in thought when the mind comes back from having been absent from mindfulness can be a really useful place to check in."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay how is the mind right now in relationship to what's happening because there's a lot that goes on when the mind wanders."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know if the mind wanders off into some you know reactive pattern or you know some thinking about the past you know it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Remembering some conversation we had with somebody where there was some tension in that conversation you know whatever's happening there as the mind is lost."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Those that those thoughts are active constructors of what we are experiencing while we're lost."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And it doesn't just disappear when the mindfulness returns you know so as the mind lost in that argument or that tension with that person as it comes back that tension is likely to be there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so to as we return from being lost in thought to be kind of curious."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And I'm going to step back for a second you know so and often when we when one of those kind of thoughts kind of construct something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "When we return from mindfulness if we're like letting go of that thought we be we're not necessarily aware that it has shaped this attitude in the back of the mind of tension or or reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And then that gets applied to whatever we're experiencing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "So so that's another time that can be really useful to to check in."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "But mostly I'd say it is something that you have to work with it, you know, consciously work with it at first and then it does begin to get more more natural and doing it in the sitting practice."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And in the sitting practice I'd say the same things apply, you know, when you're suffering, when it's going well, when the mindfulness returns when the mind returns from wandering."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "Those are three great times to use this tool to check the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You can also just occasionally check."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, like if and at the beginning at the beginning that that can be useful to just occasionally like I don't know every every few minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "And this may be a little bit of an intention at the beginning of a sitting."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Mind: The Third Foundation of Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, may I remember every few minutes to check how I am in relationship, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I'm very pleased to be here this morning."}

{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Sometimes people might wonder why Buddha has given so many discourses on the same subject."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why didn't he stick with the Mahasatifarthana Sutra which encompasses everything? Why did he break them into groups or separate classes, sections? Well, the answer is very simple."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Buddha lived for 45 years to teach Dhamma and he met thousands of people with different background, different mentality, different state of spiritual growth and different attitude."}

{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Who cannot stay without getting angry? Anybody can practice that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And who cannot give? You don't have to be a Buddhist to give."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If you practice these three things, you can go to heaven."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Practicing this meditation is."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "One of the five purposes of practicing meditation is not going to heaven."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is not included in these five purposes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So don't meditate to go to heaven."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "There is a way to go to heaven and there is a way to go to Nibbana."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "To go to Nibbana, there is only one direct method."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "To overcome sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, there is only one method."}

{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The second liberation, total liberation, without any residues left behind, is meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That's what Buddha did, and that's what he achieved."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So without any hesitation, reservation, Buddha mentioned at the very outset, this is the only direct method, other methods are indirect, you can, perhaps, through samsaric lot of practice, you may, but this is the direct method."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And in this direct method, Buddha mentioned many things."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "One is to practice, become mindful of the four foundations."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "They are called four foundations."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And in the Buddha's discourse, I lie also to mention the reason why it is called sutra."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why they are called sutras? Sutra is like a sutra that you stick, you use sutra to stick."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is called sutra because it has the thread going from the beginning to the end, one message."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Just like sutra has the beginning, middle and end."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Buddha's discourses have these three segments, three points, beginning, middle and end."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "At the beginning, Buddha was so, so profound and enlightened that he gives the summary at the beginning."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When you write good articles, paper, book, dissertation and so forth, at the very beginning you give the summary, introduction."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You can get the rough idea of what is going to discuss."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So he gave the, at the very beginning he gave the summary."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In the summary he mentioned what is going to happen in the discourse."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And he said there is only one direct method to achieve these five purposes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And then he outlined this five, this method in four steps."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "He said, let me translate that into English."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Be mindful of the mind in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Be mindful of the body in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "With diligence to overcome, with intention of reducing greed and hatred."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And satima vinayya, satima with mindfulness, vinayya having discipline, having restrain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Abhidhya domanastam loki, the covetousness and grief in the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is, be mindful of the body with the intention of overcoming covetousness and anger or disappointment in the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Now this is really very important sentence."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is what I call loaded with meaning and given in compressed form."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we have to decompress it to understand the meaning of this sentence."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "First he said, khaya anupasivirati, be mindful of the body in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Now here we hear the word body twice."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Be mindful of the body in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What does it mean? And to make it more meaningful, this particular section is divided into six categories."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So each part is a body in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "For example, he began with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We will explain all these things in detail later on at this introductory talk."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I want to give this as an example."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It started with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is called breath body according to anapa and sati sutta, mindfulness of breathing discourse."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And according to chula vedala sutta, chula vedala is a discourse delivered by a bhikkhuni dhammadhina to her ex-husband, hisakha."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And in these places the breath is explained as a body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So breath body is in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So be mindful of this breath body which is in the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is why the word be mindful of the body in the body is mentioned."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Similarly, be mindful of the feelings in feelings."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Be mindful of the feelings in the feelings one is plural, one is singular."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why is that? Because we pick one feeling at a time among many feelings."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We don't deliberately pick."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When feeling arises, if one feeling is more strong, stronger, more powerful, that naturally drags our mind into that feeling."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And then become mindful of that feeling."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We cannot be mindful of all the feelings."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "One feeling at a time becomes more conspicuous than other feelings."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When it is more conspicuous, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, mind naturally is attracted to it, dragged into it, goes there, and be mindful of that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then chitta, chitta-anupase vairati, be mindful of the mind in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Similarly, we cannot become mindful of the mind, but we can be mindful of the mind when we notice contents of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And there are various things happening in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When one particular contents, one particular thing arises in the mind, then we become mindful of that in that mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That also we will explain if we have time today."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the fourth is to be mindful of the dhammas, mindful of dhamma, in the dhammas."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When one particular dhamma arises, be mindful of that dhamma at that time."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "For this reason, Buddha used this particular sentence in each foundation of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That sounds very difficult one, but also people say, when we say this thing, people say it is easier said than done."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But from my experience, I say, is this easier done than said? If you do it, if you don't do it, you simply say, you simply brush it aside, shine it aside and say, well, who cares? We can do it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is just like you try to teach me how to swim, and see how long you take to tell me how to teach."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But for you, it is easy to swim and show me how to swim."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So it is easier for you to swim than telling me how to swim."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why? Because you have been swimming."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Similarly, if you do it every single day, every waking moment, all your life, it becomes just like breathing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You don't learn how to breathe."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So the practice also becomes so natural to our life if we do it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And then all this becomes crystal clear in our mind when we practice."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So at the very beginning, he mentioned these four statements."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then he said, ātāpi, why we want to do this? Why we want to become mindful of the mind? ātāpi, meaning with the intention of overcoming, with the intention we make effort to overcome our various mental impurities to fulfill those five purposes, at least to begin with one."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then the next word he used, sampa-jāna."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is the only place the word is given."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In this way, in the detailed explanation, the word sampa-jāna is not used."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But this is the place where sampa-jāna is used."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Sampa-jāna means clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In the commentaries, clear comprehension is explained in four ways, four fold, four different types of clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is another confused area, area where not too many of us get very clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Although we talk about clear comprehension, we don't get clear comprehension in most of the time."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Therefore, let us spend a few minutes on that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But it is very important to mention it here."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Clear comprehension is also four types, clear comprehension of the purpose, clear comprehension of the domain, clear comprehension of the suitability, and clear comprehension of non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Now, let us take each of them in turn and try to understand them."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is the clear comprehension of the purpose? These are the five-fold purpose that we already had mentioned."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We already mentioned the five-fold purpose."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to have a clear understanding of these five purposes while we meditate."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is to cleanse our mind, to overcome sorrow and lamentation, to overcome suffering and disappointment, and to follow the five-path, the noble eight-fold path, and to attain liberation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Attaining liberation is the tastiest things in all tasteful things."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And Buddha said it in the Angutnika Ayah, the highest taste of all the practice, all the dhammas, is the taste of liberation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So that is what we want to attain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We want to taste liberation, freedom, not with the tongue, but with the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, these are the five purposes we have to keep in mind, that the understanding, clear comprehension of the purpose."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then, when we practice this, we must ask the question, I practice this part of meditation, I practice mindfulness of the body, does this practice of mindfulness of the body help me to purify my mind? Ask the question, the purpose, the first of the clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The first is to have good understanding, clear understanding of the purpose."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And for this reason, we mentioned the purpose at the very beginning."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We said the purpose is to purify the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When we practice mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of the rest of the body, we must ask, does this practice purify my mind? Keep ask this question."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Second, when we practice mindfulness of the feelings, does it help me to purify my mind? Ask this question each time you practice any part of the four foundations of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "As the second question, does this help me to overcome sorrow and lamentation? That is the second purpose."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we have to have a clear understanding of the purpose, why we do what we do."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the third question, does this help me to overcome pain and suffering? You may inflict pain and suffering when you meditate."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Most meditators experience that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then they ask the question, I am supposed to practice meditation to overcome pain and suffering, but I am suffering now."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The purpose of meditation is not to inflict pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "At the very beginning, Buddha said, purpose of meditation is to get rid of pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Instead of getting rid of pain, we experience pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is one experience that everybody complains against."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Some people even given up meditation, give up meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "They say they go to for weekend meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Weekend meditation is actually one-day meditation just like this one."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "All they get during that week is pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then they leave the meditation center, meditation place, saying that, all I got this meditation is pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I don't want to meditate to get pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But the purpose of meditation is mentioned at the very outset, is to get rid of pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we have to understand the real purpose of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You cannot have pain, or you cannot have pleasure without pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "A pleasure always comes with pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The purpose of practice meditation is not to increase pain, but to overcome pain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And then we gain pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We work very hard to gain pleasure, mundane, ordinary pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But this pleasure we work very hard to gain, and we gain this pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is not mundane pleasure, not ordinary, carnal pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Pleasure with greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is the pleasure, spiritual pleasure, pleasure of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we go through little difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then we ask the fourth question, does this practice fulfill the fourth purpose? What is the fourth purpose? Following the right path."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Does this practice put me on the right path? What is the right path? Path to liberation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the fifth question we must ask, does this practice help me to liberate my suffering, liberate my defilement, liberate myself from all kinds of defilements? So we have to have a full, clear comprehension, understanding of the purpose."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is the number one of the four purposes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The four clear comprehensions."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Second clear comprehension is even more important."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is that? The domain, the field, the scope of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is the domain? The domain of meditation is nothing but our own five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Or sometimes we can put them into the four foundations of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Four foundations of mindfulness is nothing but the mindfulness of the form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Whether we say it four foundations of mindfulness or five aggregates, we say the same thing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Words are different, meaning is the same."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We use, this is our laboratory."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Everything we need to attain the goal is in this laboratory."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In this world, and that is why Abhijja, Domananda, Sangh, Vinayaya, Loke, the Buddha used the word Loke, this is my world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Each and every one of us is living in our own world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Five aggregates are our world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In Sangyuta Nikaya Buddha defined the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "World is with this one-fathomed body with this consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "One-fathomed body with this consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is the one-fathomed? Fathomed means six feet."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In that definition, I am not one-fathomed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So the fathomed is elastic, flexible fathomed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That means when you stretch our hands from middle fingertip to the other middle fingertip, that distance is one-fathomed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So each one of us is one-fathomed in our own measurement."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So within that, Buddha said, is the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why Buddha said, Buddha was so intelligent, not intelligent wise."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "There is a big difference between intelligence and wisdom anyway."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The Buddha was so wise, he gave the world in a nutshell and the whole world is here."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What you find in outside world is here."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So covetousness and grief in the world means we are not going to remove the covetousness of other people."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Reduce greed in the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Many a time people say, I want to get involved in what you call."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What you call active Buddhism, engage Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I want to engage in Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What do you want to do? Go out and tell people to reduce their greed, hatred, delusion and keep going out, doing that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And they say, reducing greed, hatred and delusion in the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So that I can live peacefully."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If there is no greed, hatred and delusion in the world, I can live peacefully."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Therefore let me go out and reduce greed, hatred and delusion in the world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And it is like somebody who wants to walk on the earth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Where to say, let me cover the entire world with leather, so that I can walk without getting my feet hurt."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "On rocks, thorns, rough areas, getting without getting burned and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So let me cover the whole world with leather."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And somebody would say, mister, it's not going to work."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "On the one hand you cannot collect enough leather to do that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "On the other hand, before you collect enough leather, you will die."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Because you don't live that long."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Thirdly, you have to kill so many animals."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "There may not be that many animals that has that thick leather."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And therefore what you should do is to cut piece of leather and make a pair of shoes and then walk."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is the Buddha's method."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That means reduce greed and hatred in the world, in our world."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When I reduce my greed and hatred and delusion, I can move among people who have greed, hatred and delusion without being affected by their greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And that's what the Buddha did."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So the second clear comprehension should be the domain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The domain is not in the world, outside."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And this is, as I said, our own laboratory where we have to work."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Normally people don't like to use their own laboratories."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "They want to borrow others' laboratories and work there and let their own laboratory get rusty, collect dust and collect garbage, dirt and use others when they turn back and they see their laboratories are filled with dirt."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And in this meditation, the Buddha said, therefore, have a clear comprehension of the domain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is your domain? There's a very beautiful story in Samyutini Gaya."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I think most of you might have heard, since some of you are Dharma teachers, some of you have listened to many Dharma talks by giving very beautiful Dharma teachers."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This story you might have heard thousands of times."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But I like to present it myself again so that you may remember it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If you have memorized it, you will hear different version of it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Anyway, this is the little story that Buddha gave to illustrate the meaning of domain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "He said there was a little quail and one day a big hawk came and grabbed this quail because the quail was, you know, walking around and, you know, basking in the sun and relaxing and going away and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So the hawk came and grabbed him and took him away."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then he was being taken away."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The quail said to himself, today is my bad unlucky day and this fellow is going to kill me."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Had I been in my own domain, this quail would not be a match in fight."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I could have defeated him very easily had I been in my own domain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then the hawk, without getting upset, you know, listening to this little quail's challenge, hawk did not get upset."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "He asked the quail, what is a domain by the way? He said that newly cloud field where there are big clouds of mud, that is my field, domain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Or is it so? I can take you there and leave there."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So he took him and left there and by leaving him there, he said, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow I come and get you."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Is it okay? So he dropped him and flew away."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Next day he came and quail was sitting on a big cloud of mud and he saw the hawk sweeping, you know, stooping down, coming down as he was approaching the quail very quickly, rushed under huge cloud of mud."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the hawk came and looked around, he could not see him."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "From the distance he saw the quail."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Now when he came close, he could not see him."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And he got very angry and bit, bit, bit his breast and flew away."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And Buddha said, similarly, if you stay in your own domain, Mahara will not come and get you."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You will be trapped by the Mahara if you leave your domain and try to borrow others' domains."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to always remember our domain is our own five aggregates, body, feeling, perception, thoughts, and volition, and volitional formations and consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we have to clearly understand these five aggregates, this body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is another subject I talk, like all this we find in the discourse."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the third clear comprehension is also very important."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is the third? That is the suitability."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And people say, sometimes suitability is, this place is suitable for meditation, near supermarket, near casino, or in the casino, or the public well, or swimming pool, and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "No, no, no, they are not suitable."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So they look for suitable, clear comprehension of suitability, something like this."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Suitability is always referring to this practice, asking ourselves, is this practice suitable for attaining that goal, five-four goals? Is this practice of mindfulness or breathing suitable for purifying the mind? That is the suitability."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The subject, the practice must match the goal."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And ask, is this suitable for, if it is not suitable for gaining that purpose, I should not practice it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If it is suitable for this time, for this mentality, for this state, and this is what I should practice."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Suppose you practice mindfulness of the body, focus in mind on the parts of the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is another big subject of meditation, parts of the body."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When you practice the meditation on the parts of the body, all of a sudden, instead of reducing to a lust, lust can increase."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "At that time, you should be able to ask yourself, is this practice suitable for me at this time? Then you will realize, no, the more you meditate on this, the more lust increases in me, therefore I must abandon this and choose another subject from the same, the sutta, and you practice that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Why you want to, your purpose is to overcome greed, covetousness and hatred."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When you practice the part of meditation on the various parts of the body, if hatred arises, you abandon it and choose another part because your purpose is to overcome your hatred."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, suitability also must match the purpose and the subject."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is suitable, not the place."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It is, some people say, when you go to the kitchen, you have a purpose of going to the kitchen."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When you go to the bedroom, you have a purpose in going to the bedroom and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "These are not the purposes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The real purpose is, the suitability means that you have to have a clear understanding."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Is this suitable for gaining this goal? And the fourth clear comprehension is non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is even more difficult and very deep subject."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to have a clear comprehension, clear understanding of the clarity, non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That means, when you practice meditation, this one of the four foundations of mindfulness, whichever it is, if we begin to relapse into the belief that there must be something permanent, something solid, you are deluded, and you should be able to penetrate that solidity, that permanency, to see the impermanence and non-solid state."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That means the practice is to penetrate the ways and the blocks going through into the reality."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, these are the four clear comprehensions."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The word sati is used for several meanings."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "One meaning, I have given some explanation in my mindfulness in plain English."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In Chapter 13, I have spent a lot of time in explaining it."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I advise people to read that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Among many meanings, one meaning is non-conceptual or pre-conceptual awareness."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "To see things exactly as they are without distortion."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What do we mean by seeing things as they really are? That also is a heavily loaded phrase."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "See means, how can we see? We always see when we open our eyes, we see."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Do we see things exactly as they are when we open our eyes? Superficially, yes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When we open our eyes, look at things."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We see they are color, shape, size, height, shades and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "These are not the reality."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "These are the superficial appearance of the object."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The word vipassana also has a very special meaning."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That means seeing things as they really are."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Seeing here is not with eyes open, but with eyes closed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This must be a very special seeing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Seeing things with eyes closed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We see when we close our eyes and open our wisdom eye, like platypus."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You know platypus living in Tasmania."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This animal looks like a beaver."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It's a mammal, breastfeeding babies."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And this animal, when he approaches a prey, at the accessible distance, he closes his eyes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When he closes his eyes, there is a device right in the middle of his forehead, above his nose, and that device opens and sends electric current to stun the animal."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Then he opens his eyes and catches the prey."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "But he has to close the eyes when he approaches the prey to open this device to stun the animal."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Similarly, when we close our eyes, close our ears, close our nose, close our mouth, close our body, and focus on what really is happening in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We cannot close, we cannot plug our ears, we can hear sound."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And they convert inside and something is happening inside."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When we pay this undivided, nonverbal, preconceptual attention to the sound we hear, we hear the change."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We experience impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When we open our eyes, our eyes go here and there and bring a lot of information from outside and distort our awareness of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When we close our eyes and just pay attention, nonverbal, nonlabelling, nonconceptual attention, we can exactly experience the changes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Just like when you listen to music, if you want to enjoy music, don't criticize."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You can really enjoy music."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If you start commenting, verbalizing, conceptualizing, criticizing, commenting, you never enjoy."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is much deeper than that."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "To understand the true nature of something, something here means not outside, something in this body and mind, just pay attention."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is called sati, one meaning of sati."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In vipassana, there is another word to understand, to make mindfulness or vipassana more meaningful."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is why the Buddha used the word kaya-kaya-anupasna-virati."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So we combine these two words, kaya-anupasana-virati, vedana-anupasana-virati, kitta-anupasana-virati, dhamma-anupasana-virati."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And even to make it even brief, we said kaya-anupasana, vedana-anupasana, sitta-anupasana, dhamma-anupasana."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "In all these, we have the word anupasana."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What is anupasana? We have to understand the meaning of anupasana to understand the meaning of vipasana."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Vipasana means seeing in a very special way."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Anupasana is seeing it as it is happening, no before, no after."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Simultaneously with the happening, the mind must be able to register what is happening, not before, no after."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And sometimes this is explained in being aware of the present, present moment."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Present moment is not the past, no in the future, but in the present."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And this is what anupasana means, seeing certain things happening in the body and mind as they are happening."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And when these two combine together, we can gain vipasana."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is vipasana with anupasana, seeing them happening as they are happening."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "By paying total, pure, clean, undivided attention without words, concepts, ideas, labors, only then we can see what is happening."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "With, as I said, with eyes open, we cannot see our body, even if we look in the mirror to see our body, how much we can see? Only the front, we cannot see the back, we cannot see the top of our head, we can see the right eye on the left."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You know, we move the right hand and we see in the mirror, we are moving left hand."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You write M, A, Y and hold against the mirror, you can see YAM."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "If you see, write T, K, E, Y and hold against the mirror, you can see YAK."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So even if you look in the mirror, with eyes open, you cannot see the object exactly as it is."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So you cannot trust our eyes."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "What people call seeing is believing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You cannot believe what you see."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So this is a very, very special way of seeing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And the pure seeing, wonderful seeing, no prejudice, no biases."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It's a clear, pure seeing."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, kaya kaya nupasana kaya nupaswita atata api sampa jhanu satima vinaya loke abhijya domanastang."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This phrase also is important to remember."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Vinaya means restraining, disciplining."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "It's also heavily loaded because there are five kinds of disciplining."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Sangvara means restraining."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to restrain our senses with effort, with patience, with mindfulness, with wisdom, and with effort."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "All these things must involve in our mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to have a lot of patience."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "People always ask, Bhante, is there any shortcut? This seems to be very, very long."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We don't have that much time."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "When I was in Washington, a woman came working in the World Bank at lunchtime."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "She came and said, Bhante, I have one hour."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I have to go back to work."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Teach me meditation so that I attain enlightenment and go back to work."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I said, I'm sorry, I don't have what you call this quick pill, you know, to boost your attainment of enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Very quickly they want to attain."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "The quicker you want to attain, the longer you will take."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So you have to have a lot of patience."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Just be fully aware of what is happening bit by bit."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And if you're trying to grab everything, you are just like trying to grab the whole heap of orange."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That is called discipline."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We have to do it with patience, with effort, with mindfulness, with wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "They are called Seela Sanghara, Virya Sanghara, Kanti Sanghara, Sati Sanghara, and Jnana Sanghara."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Abhija Domanastham, Vinaya Vinaya means discipline."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And having overcome greed, covetousness, and anger."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Covetousness is translated as excessive greed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "That implies that there is certain amount of greed, and over and above that is excessive."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So you can have certain amount of greed, and over and above is excessive."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Actually, it simply means gross greed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "He cannot eliminate greed all of a sudden, but at least try to overcome this oozing, very gross type of greed."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Other greed will slowly vanish eventually when you overcome the very gross part."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, I think I am supposed to stop the talk now, this morning."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "This is the introduction to the Mahasattipatthana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "And then we go, you know, we are supposed to do some meditation also."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Morning is the best time to meditate."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Artificial meditation will be difficult."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "Therefore, I have a plan for afternoon meditation to make it easy."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "We do little walking meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I give you some instructions on walking meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "You might have heard people giving instructions, you might have learned how to do walking meditation and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "I also like to introduce my version of walking meditation for you to either clarify or get more confused."}
{"prompt": "Four Foundations of Mindfulness (1 of 4)", "completion": "So, let us see afterwards."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Arriving in your physical experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And just checking in, how are you in this moment? How we are in this moment is conditioned based on what's happened to us in the day, how we're relating to it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And so we could also say that in mindfulness practice and coming into this present moment experience, we're getting to see conditioning playing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Actually, that's a very powerful function of mindfulness to begin to understand the conditioned nature of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And so how you are right now, it's not a mistake and it's not an accident."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "It is conditions unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And can your mind be receptive at ease with these conditions unfolding? And as we explore being receptive and at ease with the conditions unfolding, we also can acknowledge that there is this capacity we have to influence the conditions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Being aware of the conditions is one way that that influence unfolds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And as we become aware of our experience, there can be a kind of a movement towards relaxation if there's any tension in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And that relaxation can in turn support this capacity to be aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "If there are places of tension of holding in your body, if it's accessible to relax or release that tension, it's fine to do that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "I'm going to notice what effect that has on your experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And as there is some relaxation of body, maybe some release of perhaps there can even be some relaxation of holding in the mind of worries, concerns, memories of the past or future thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "As the body and mind relax, perhaps there can be another checking in with how is the experience in the present moment? What is the experience in the body? Can you connect with this physical present moment experience? No."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Perhaps a little more fully."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Maybe connecting to this breath in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Aware of the breath in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "One of the simplest instructions the Buddha offered for meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Breathing in, know that you're breathing in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Breathing out, know that you're breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "In that instruction, that simple instruction, the emphasis is on the knowing, not on the details of what the breath feels like, but just aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "For example, whatever is obvious in that in-breath and out-breath, you can receive the in-breath and out-breath rather than having the mind dive into or look at or try to search out the in-breath and the out-breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "So this is an in-breath and this is an out-breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And while connecting with that experience, it's probably going to happen that the attention gets pulled to something else at times."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Something else becomes obvious and that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "You don't have to try to hold on to the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "What we're exploring is staying connected with awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "So if while you're noticing the in-breath and out-breath, there's a recognition that the attention shifts to hearing or another body sensation or an emotion or a mood."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Just stay connected with the awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "We can be aware of breathing in and breathing out and aware of hearing and aware of feeling just moment after moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And the habit of the mind to get lost in thought will happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "The habit very natural for this to happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Equally natural at some point, the mindfulness will return."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "There's not much we can do while the mind is not mindful."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "But that moment when mindfulness returns our relationship to that moment, that's a really helpful moment to be appreciative of."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Mindfulness came back of its own accord effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Can you attune to that? Awareness is back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And what is awareness knowing in that moment? What is it already receiving? Can there be some curiosity about that? Allow yourself to connect to that moment of mindfulness of awareness as it returns."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Acknowledging what is there."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And then if it's supportive, if it feels helpful for your staying connected and staying aware, it's fine to allow the breath to come back in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "But remembering we don't have to hold on to the breath either."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "We're cultivating this capacity to be aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Aware of breathing, sensing, hearing, feeling."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "And if it's supportive for you, you're welcome to use the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "It's kind of a grounding or landing place to help you remember."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "What is it like to know experience? Breathing in knowing that you're breathing in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Breathing out knowing that you're breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Arriving in this moment, in this place where you're physically located."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "In this time, opening to how you are right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "However you are, can your heart open to that? Allow how you are to be so that it can be received in awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Receiving your experience as it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "This can take some trust at times to open to just how you are in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Trusting the value of that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Trusting the value of opening to what is here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "When we open to our experience, from a particular perspective, a perspective of curiosity and openness and allowing, what is this experience as a human experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "That perspective begins to let wisdom grow, begins to let the possibility of transformation happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily happen quickly."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "And yet the power of mindfulness and wisdom to transform our hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "It's one of the strongest powers or potencies there is in terms of transformation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "When we can rest with just what is here, if that's confusion or anger or fear or love or compassion."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Wisdom and awareness help us to understand and feel the difference between more wholesome responses, helpful responses to the world and less helpful, unskillful responses to the world and to our experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "At some point the Buddha called our experience and said, what I call the world is this experience of the sadhana body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "The internal and the external coming together in our experience in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Well, sometimes this exploration of being with, of allowing what's here, sometimes can feel passive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "The power of wisdom and awareness together is not passive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "It works, those forces work on our hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "Begin to support this transformation of letting go a release of those energies that create struggle, distress, suffering, both internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "So can you for this time, sitting together, explore this possibility of cultivating this perspective of curiosity of what is this experience? What is this human experience that's arising right now, here and now? Can the heart hold it, be open to it, feel the suffering or the joy of what is here? Whatever is happening for you, whatever is unfolding, it's allowed in this field of awareness and wisdom, even anger, to be allowed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "This transformation and joy are allowed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "This activity of allowing and receiving isn't the only way to engage with experience, but it is a crucial support of helping us to understand what the skillful and the unskillful are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "When reactivity, when states based in greed, aversion, delusion are arising."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "The holding of them with compassion and love and allowing is possible."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness and Wisdom as Action", "completion": "And that place can lead to transformation both internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So some of you may have wondered when Gil talked yesterday about clear comprehension of domain, why we didn't do suitability."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And today I'm also not going to talk about suitability."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I'm planning to, in our plan for this retreat, we decided to have the conversation around suitability be the last night's talk, essentially, looking at how we can bring clear comprehension into our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And it feels like the clear comprehension of suitability, it really speaks to that well."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So today we're going to move to clear comprehension of non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This aspect of clear comprehension is connected to seeing experience as it is, as it actually is."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Our human system tends to experience the world through a number of layers, a number of filters, some of which are culturally conditioned and some of which are more embedded in our human nature, some of the ways in which we tend to not see things as they are, the ways in which some of the more foundational or fundamental ways that delusion operates is at a very human level."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It is across cultures we share these kinds of delusions, these kinds of mistakes, misperceptions, misunderstandings about the nature of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "In the teachings of the Buddha, it points to how our usual perspective on the world is not aligned with the truth of things as they actually are."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And this perspective is not a kind of a passive not knowing of the truth."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's more of an active distortion of experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "If it were simply about information, we could be told the information and we would start to perhaps see things in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But these delusions operate at a kind of more fundamental level and they're active distortions."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This delusion is not about just simply not knowing something."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's an active misperception, an active distortion of experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Yesterday, Gil, speaking about the domain of our practice being the place where we are nourished, nourished in particular in terms of what leads us in the direction of freedom, of non-clinging, of release."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The domain is that terrain in which, I can say the wholesome is nourished."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The way delusion operates, one of the ways that delusion operates is that it's having us believe that we are being nourished in places that are actually not nourishing, being nourished by things that are not nourishing in terms of what leads us to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But today, in terms of exploring this topic, I'd like to kind of orient to or be curious about exploring with you how we might become aware of some of these delusions, how we might become aware of these fundamental misperceptions and that the beginning to understand, beginning to become aware of delusion, how it works in our minds, is one, perhaps we could say, a step in the direction of opening to clear comprehension of non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We have to know delusion in order to understand non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Now, that may sound like how can we possibly know delusion, but we can."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There are some understandings that are some descriptions and some understandings conveyed in some of the teachings that help us to kind of orient to the particular places where our human minds get confused."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And through orienting to those and being curious about those confusions, we can begin to understand something of how delusion works."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So there's some core delusions that are pointed to, and they kind of reflect in a way the flip side, which is the wisdom that frees our mind, the understanding that experience is impermanent, unreliable, and not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is the wisdom that we begin to open to through the practice of being in the domain, knowing our experience as experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We start to see that experience is impermanent, unreliable, and not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The core delusions are the inversion of those."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We tend to take what is impermanent to be permanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We tend to take what is unreliable to be reliable, and we tend to take what is not self to be self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so looking at each of these briefly, seeing what is impermanent is permanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The nature of our experience, the nature of the way our human system processes experience, we could say perhaps, there's a lot of information coming in, and in some ways, in order to navigate all of that information coming in, our mind simplifies."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It simplifies through the use of concept."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It also kind of smooths out the amount of changing information that comes in."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Just as an example, if I had a camera hooked to my head, and it looked around the room, and we played the film back of what the camera saw, if you looked at that, it would look pretty jumpy."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Every time the head moves, and if the camera could even track the eyes, every time the eyes move, it's like there's a new image."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But our human system is designed to smooth that out."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So when I look through these eyes and look around the room, it doesn't look like the room is jumping around."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is just one way that the perceptual system kind of reinforces this notion of stability."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Our system tends to kind of smooth things out a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There was one time I was at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and we walked into the Exploratorium, and on the ceiling hung kind of towards the back of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "They were probably 10 feet long, maybe 4 or 5 inches around, and there were flashing lights on those bars."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There were probably 15 or so of these bars hanging maybe 4 or 5 feet apart, and it was just flashing lights on these bars."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And I looked at that and thought, huh, I wonder what that's about, and just kind of forgot about it, and went around looking at the other exhibits, and at one point I was at the Exploratorium with my nephew, and we'd stopped and sat down to have a snack, have a little drink or something, and he's looking up and kind of looking around, and suddenly he says, wow, it's a school bus! And I look up and he's looking at these bars with the flashing lights on them, and I said, what? What are you saying? And then he said, now it's butterflies! I was like, what are you talking about? I don't see this."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I took some time to stand there and observe these flashing lights, and at some point there was a kind of a way that the perceptual system oriented to the flashing lights, and it was like, instead of seeing bars, the mind perceived a screen."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The screen about 10 feet high, and maybe 40 feet long, and across that screen was driving a school bus."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Now, I understand from the description of this thing, you know, that basically the lights flashing on this, it's kind of like each bar, each bar, the lights flashing on this bar, are the perceptual system, like if the eyes moved at just the right pace from bar to bar, it's like the perceptual system carried the image of the light flashing from one bar to another."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so it's almost like if you're looking through a fence at somebody walking on the other side of the fence, you can kind of fill in the gaps there between the slats of the fence."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's kind of what the mind was doing here."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So what was actually going on were these flashes of lights, these just bits of information, and the mind created an object or a kind of a permanence, a sense of there being something there that wasn't actually there."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And what was amazing to me actually is that the detail on the image of the school bus was so clear that I could read the name of the school district on the side of the school bus."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is the level at which our perceptual system creates continuity."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I knew I was actually there, was just bars with flashing lights."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The perceptual system saw a screen with a school bus driving across it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So this is also part of this is the bars were rapidly flashing change, change in the lights."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so the part of our perceptual system is that when there's rapid change, it kind of smooths that out and makes sense of that rapid change."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So as we start to be curious about our experience in this, just what is actually happening here? We start to recognize that also concept can obscure or mask change."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So the rapidity of change can mask change, but also an idea, a kind of a sense that we are looking at something."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So for instance, I know many of you have explored or noticed pain in your meditative career."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And if you're looking at pain from the perspective of the concept of pain, it can feel like a block, it can feel like something solid, something really permanent and big."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But then if you kind of get curious about, well, what's the actual experience there? What's the actual experience that's happening? You might notice a very dynamic kind of changing experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The concept of pain overlaid on top of that experience often creates the sense of something more solid."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And if we're experiencing the sensations through the concept of pain, we may not be noticing the rapidity of change."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We may not be noticing how it comes and goes, how it flashes in and out."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So one way to begin to explore this aspect of how our minds tend to distort this is if there's something in your experience that feels solid or stable, this understanding that nothing lasts for very long, the kind of the truth of impermanence, the truth of the rapidity of which our system is taking in information and things are changing, then when there's something that feels solid, it can be interesting to explore, well, what is that? What is it that feels solid? Is it really as solid as I think it is? What are you taking to be permanent and being curious about that? So this is a way in to explore this, taking what is impermanent to be permanent, noticing what our minds take to be permanent and being curious."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Is it actually permanent? If I allow the mind to rest with that thing that seems so solid and stable, what happens? Does it start to see subtle fluctuations? Does it start to see the changing nature of that experience? There's nothing in our experience that lasts for more than a split second."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so if it feels like something is lasting for longer than that, that is worth exploring, it is worth, you know, taking in, oh, this is the mind, taking this to be solid and stable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So at first we kind of just may just need to recognize or know this is the mind taking something to be permanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that's a way in which we inform ourselves of this delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And if we don't have to, we don't have to agree that it's impermanent yet."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I mostly am curious to have you begin to investigate."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Is it actually permanent? You don't have to convince your mind that it's not permanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The second kind of distortion or misunderstanding is that we tend to take what is unreliable as a lasting source of happiness to be reliable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is the delusion that's embedded in wanting and desire, that delusion that, yeah, if I get this thing, if I get this thing, I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And not only is the delusion of greed that kind of flavor, if I get this thing, I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The delusion in that is, there's a kind of a deeper level of delusion in that we believe that this kind of happiness that comes from getting what I want is as good as it gets."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Maybe we kind of know that it's not permanent lasting happiness, but we don't really understand or we still feel like, well, that's, if I'm going to have any happiness, this is where it's going to come."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We don't quite understand that there's other ways happiness arises, the happiness of letting go, the happiness of non-clinging."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So this, again, is like, where are we searching for happiness? Where are we thinking happiness will be found? Getting what we want does bring a certain kind of happiness, and that's why we tend to go there, because it does give us a moment of feeling like, oh yeah, that's nice having that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And then when that fades, we kind of look for, well, the last time I felt really good was when I got something I wanted."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So what can I find to get so that I can have that moment of happiness again? And we just end up on this like cycle of trying to get the next thing so that we have as many of those moments of getting that hit of happiness, getting that hit of, oh, I got that thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So we try to create our lives."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We end up like in this cycle of trying to just accumulate those moments."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The Buddha encouraged us to acknowledge, he acknowledged that there is a kind of happiness that comes from getting what we want, but he encouraged us to look at how reliable is that happiness? The teaching, the language that Bikubo uses is we're encouraged to look at the gratification that comes with getting something that we want and to explore or how far does that gratification extend? So how long does the happiness last when we get it? How long does it last? We start to really see the instability of that happiness, the unreliability of that happiness, and that our mind has been looking for happiness in this place that is not very reliable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Another interesting exploration around this I mentioned in terms of looking at the impermanent nature of experience that concept is overlaid on experience and tends to obscure or mask the impermanent nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "When we're seeing experience through the concept lens, and that's a lot of how we navigate experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We know experience through the concepts rather than through the direct experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That's essentially the way in which when I look around the room that the mind isn't seeing things jumping all over the place because of the concept of the objects being stable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So I'm not seeing a little flash of the chair and then another flash of it looking like something else and a flash of it looking like something else."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I see the chair and it doesn't matter that my head is moving and getting different images of the chair."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The mind sees the chair because it's holding the concept of the chair."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "As we start to look at what it is that we're taking, where we're looking for happiness, we also might recognize that some of the places that we look for happiness are like, what do we actually want when we want something? We think we want the thing, perhaps, but a kind of a curiosity and an investigation about what we actually want can be very interesting."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like, what is it that we think we're going to get from this thing? Often there's a whole bunch of ideas that float around with the idea of the happiness of the getting."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So, for instance, if I get this new car, for instance, then I'm not going to have problems with my car having those mechanical failures anymore and it's going to be much easier for me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So there's kind of a whole host of ideas about what this new car is going to do for me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's actually when we start to look at what we want, what we actually want, is not some real thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What we want is a concept."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Again, this is an exploration for you."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "When there is something that you find you want, it can be, if you're caught in that wanting in the sense of, yeah, if I get that thing, then I'm going to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It can be interesting to look at, well, what is the happiness? What is the idea of the happiness that thinks it's going to come? What is the wanting about? What is actually being wanted? Mostly, we want a concept, not the actual thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And what is a concept? It's a fleeting thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's an impermanent, unreliable thing in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So again, curiosity about where you think you're going to find happiness, looking at that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What is it that you actually want? And if you get that, how far, how far does the gratification extend? How reliable is the happiness? Does it give it as much as we thought it would? Does it give us as much as we thought it would? And what happens when that moment of happiness or the kind of sense of happiness around something fades? What happens then? What does the mind do then? It tends to start looking for the next thing to find a hit of happiness on."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Then, this third way of taking what is not self to be self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Again, the exploration is, what is it that we take to be self? To explore it from the perspective of delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We look at, we don't try to come up with some bypassing of a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But in real honesty, this sense of self is what's arising."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What is that? What am I taking to be self? How stable is it? This can be very interesting."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We tend to, with senses of self, we tend to take them to be stable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Kind of a sense of, this is me and we carry it through time."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "When I've really started looking at my own sense of self, and I have to now say it's not one, there are many, many senses of self that the mind has woven together to create some kind of thought that there's a coherent whole sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But looking at what I'm taking to be self, looking at that experience in the moment, what am I taking to be self? From moment to moment, it can shift, it can change radically."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "In one moment, there might be a sense of self relating to a particular role, a particular set of conditions."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And then in the next moment, something happens, conditions change, and our mind picks up a whole different set of interpretations and identifications."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It can happen really quickly, this shift, and again, being aware in the moment what we are taking to be self, we start to see that there's not a lot of stability in what we're taking to be self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so that begins to undermine our sense that there is something stable around a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Before I started practicing, I had a very strong view of myself as being miserable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I was often feeling put upon, feeling lonely, left out, all kinds of things that kind of put me in this place of feeling miserable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And kind of looking back on my experience as I began to understand something of the nature of my mind, I can see that what I used to do, I mean, it wasn't that I was like never not miserable, but what my mind did when I experienced happiness was something like, well, yeah, I'm happy now, but I know what I really am is miserable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Kind of talking myself into the stability of that, not taking in that miserableness was an identity that kind of arose at times based on conditions and wasn't there at other times."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like, why didn't I impute the permanence to the happiness instead of the miserableness? It's like, I don't know which, you know, whether one arose more or not, but, you know, it's kind of like the mind, for some reason, latched onto the miserableness and imputed a sense of kind of stability to that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so this kind of investigation of what are you taking to be self? And again, perhaps a sense of is it always there, especially for senses of self that are, once that we frequently identify with or think that's me, really useful to notice when it's not there."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Notice that it's there sometimes and it's not there sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Begins to poke holes in our belief that it's there somehow or that it's that's me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So again, the investigation of what is it that I'm taking to be self? With each of these, we orient towards exploring the delusion by being curious about what am I taking to be solid, stable? What am I taking to be reliable? What am I taking to be self? And that helps us to start to see how delusion works in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "These distortions, these delusions operate at different levels in our psyche, in our mind."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There's one teaching that talks about these distortions operating at the level of perception, at the level of thought, and at the level of view."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so, for instance, we might, at the level of perception, we might take an experience in and just the way perception works, it's kind of a pattern-matching thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It does the best job it can of matching what we're seeing with what we've known before."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so, there's kind of like a pattern-matching that happens."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And we might, just recently, I was walking down the sidewalk and there was a kind of a shape that was laying on the sidewalk that was a long, thin, stretched-out shape."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And there was a perception for a moment, oh, is that a snake? And immediately, the mind could see, oh, no, it's not a snake, it's just the crack in the sidewalk."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But there was a split second where the mind kind of perceived it as a snake."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That's kind of like a pattern-matching thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like the mind sees this particular shape and color and based on experience in the past, picks it up."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And that's a distortion or a misperception that at the perceptual level."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And when there's a mistake at the perceptual level, it usually doesn't take too much to correct it if you have a second look at it or get some further information."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But if at the level, at the next level, there's a kind of a thought that we perhaps, you know, see that, we perceive that thing, and then we kind of go the next level and start thinking."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, it's like, oh, that's a snake."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That means this and this and this."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, it's kind of like, our minds start thinking about it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's just beginning to get to the point of believing it's a snake, but it starts thinking about it in this way."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that's the next level of distortion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We've picked up essentially the concept and started playing with it in our mind."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The third level of distortion is the level of view, where we actually start to believe that the perception, the thought is what it is, and it's going to be hard to convince us otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, like we were walking down the street, we saw this thing, we thought it was a snake, we walked way around it, we were convinced it was a snake, and then somebody else like took a walk and, you know, and we came back to them and said, well, how did you see that snake? And you're, no, I didn't see any snake."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so you've got it in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You get this belief there was a snake, and somebody else says, you know, I walked on that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There was not a snake there."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I know there was not a snake there, but you cannot be convinced because the view is so strong that you believe the view, and it's hard even with evidence to the contrary that your view is not the case."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Now, this may sound like, you know, a kind of, this sounds like a kind of a silly example, but at the same time, you know, this level of distortion is happening to us all the time, in particular around the sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, we believe in that sense of self so much."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There's so much evidence to the contrary that, you know, that there's so much evidence for the truth of not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But even in the face of that, we are not, it's like, we'll, like for instance, you know, the fact that we cannot control our thoughts, you know, that came up today in the groups that, you know, judgment, self-judgment would arise after the mind wandered in thought."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And, you know, checking in, you know, it's like, if you had the choice, you know, if you had control, you know, and this is what our minds tell us, you know, it's like, I'm judging myself, I should be able to stop judging myself."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Can you stop judging yourself? Can you just turn it off? Can you say to your mind, stop judging? Sometimes we can kind of recognize, well, that's not so helpful and kind of let it go, but often we can't just flip the switch."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Like, we can't just say, yeah, mind be different."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That's actually evidence for not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The Buddha pointed to that in one of his teachings."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "He said, you know, mental formations are not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Judgment is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We can put judgment in there."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, judgment is not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It, if judgment were self, it would be possible to say of judgment, may judgment be thus or not be thus, but it is not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So it is not possible to say of judgment, may judgment be thus or not be thus."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It is this uncontrollable, the sense that, you know, when the sense of self is frustrated, it's usually running into evidence for not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so instead of frustration, maybe this can be an exploration."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What is the not self nature that's showing up? So that's this kind of view that I am a self is so strong that we, it's very hard for us to see the evidence for not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So these three distortions, these three levels of distortions, I want to go through an example from my practice that kind of revealed all three levels to me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "First, I'll tell the story and then I'll kind of go back and point to the various mistakes and perception that happened."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So I was meditating in Burma."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I was usually meditating in my room in the afternoons and it seemed like most days at the, you know, you know, late afternoon hour, I would hear the squealing sound and that squealing sound was perceived as a pig squealing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This kind of, you know, it's like I lived on a, in a dormitory that was right near the wall of the meditation center."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And there were lots of sounds that came over the wall from the village that was not too far from there, you know, sounds of loudspeakers and people and, and squealing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And I thought, okay, well, this is a pig squealing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that's essentially perception, right? That's perception is like the sound is being perceived as a pig."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so the, the mind then started to, you know, think about this and the thinking about the sound of the, the pig and the squealing sound, the, the, the, the squealing sounded kind of distressed to me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And my mind created the, the view, the, the idea that this regular everyday squealing sound that was happening was because there was a, a pig farmer on the other side who was slaughtering the pig for the next day selling at the market."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so that, I knew that was a view."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I knew that I didn't know that that was happening."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But that was the story my mind created."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And, you know, I thought there was compassion in the heart for the pig that was being slaughtered."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so, you know, the, the view shaped the feelings."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And this went on for a couple weeks, you know, this, this experience is regular every night hearing the squealing, seeing these images of pigs and pigs being slaughtered and feeling the compassion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And, and then one evening instead of doing the meditation in my room, I decided to do walking meditation at about that time."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So I, I'm just walking up and down the driveway in the middle of the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And I began kind of noticing there were these bats that were like flying at me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, it's like they would come right at me and then veer off."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It was kind of, it was like, there were a lot of them, but they never hit me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "They were just kind of like, you know, flying all around me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And these bats were squealing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "These bats were squealing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And in that moment, there was the recognition that the mind had misperceived."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So it was very quick that that misperception was corrected quickly when the information, the extra information was given, you know, the information about seeing the bats."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So the misperception was corrected quickly."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But what was kind of amazing to me was that while I knew, it was kind of amazing, I knew that there was, that it was a view that, that I did not know that pigs were being slaughtered on the other side of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I knew that I didn't know that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But it had not occurred to me that there were not even pigs on the other side of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That view that there were pigs on the other side of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that perception of the squeal, the squeal coming into being perceived as a pig, shifted from being the, you know, just thinking about it as a pig into an actual view that it was a pig."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like it was shocking to me to recognize that I had, you know, for two weeks been believing there were, there were pigs on the other side of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So these, these, these three different levels of perception or misperception kind of feed into each other too."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So when we have a view of something that, you know, the belief in that view, then that view then influences how we perceive things."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Further reinforcing that perception for leading to more thoughts about that, which further reinforces the view, this kind of cycle happens between these levels of misperception."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so becoming curious about."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So the teaching on, the teaching on delusion begins to point as to, there's some specific areas that we can be curious about."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "If we're taking something to be permanent or taking something to be reliable or taking something to be self, you don't have to convince yourself to not take it to be that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But investigate, be curious about it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Suffering can be a useful kind of metric for us."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Or, you know, if we are suffering, there is some kind of delusion present."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So when they're suffering present and delusion, I think I said this a few days ago, often is at the level of belief."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so there can be a kind of a power to, as you're exploring suffering, a power to being curious about, well, what's being believed here? What's being believed? We can also hold or help our minds to have some ease around the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like when there is suffering, as I said, there's some kind of delusion present."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Sometimes if we just remind ourselves of some of the foundational truths, this is unrival."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I'm kind of pointing to that, that truth."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That was quite amazing to me as I, you know, kind of the mind shifted instead of, you know, kind of being embedded in the suffering to recognizing, oh, this is, this is what the Buddha asked us to understand."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That wisdom reflection helped there to be a little more capacity to hold and be curious, investigate that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Or perhaps, depending on, you may, you may have a sense that the mind is clinging to something being stable or wanting something to be, to be kind of solid or lasting."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And just reminding yourself this is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So sometimes we can use wisdom reflections, thoughts in the mind that can help the mind to be able to hold and be curious about these ways that we're suffering."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That's where deluded by these delusions, the wool gets pulled over our eyes by these delusions."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Sometimes in this process we do start to see through delusion as we, as we explore open to what is this thing that I'm taking to be stable and it begins to kind of be shown as instable where we see the not self-nature of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's just a thought arising."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There's a way in which the mind kind of releases sometimes in the seeing of that, the seeing through that delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There's a kind of an ease or a release that can happen as the mind sees through that delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But the seeing of that, at least in my experience, it's particular conditions that come together for us to see through a particular delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And those conditions that allow us to see through a particular delusion are impermanent, often impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so it's not a mistake, actually, when the delusion comes back."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's the nature of the impermanence of the conditions that let us to see that thing clearly."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And yet, having seen something clearly, having seen through a delusion like that, that gives us more capacity to then recognize, oh, this is just delusion at work."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I know that the mind knows that it has seen through it before."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It knows it's seeing through this delusional filter."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "There can be a kind of a clarity of like, yeah, this is not trustable."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Even if we can't see through the delusion in that moment, there's a way that we can know it is delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And that right there, we're back in the domain."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We are in the domain of knowing what's here."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is taking something to be permanent that's not permanent."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so we can begin to, we start with the information of hearing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I think I'm so grateful for the Buddha to pointing these particular delusions out to say, yeah, be curious about these particular things."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This will help you to find the ways that you're clinging because it is around these delusions that clinging operates."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So we need to hear the information and be curious, investigate the ways that we're taking things to be permanent, reliable, self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And then we begin to understand, to see the impermanent, unreliable, not self, nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "One of this talk has a lot of information in it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And one way to take in the talk like this is just to let it kind of land, just kind of like sometimes talk about this is, Dharma talk is kind of like rain."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's nourishment, it's nourishment for the the soil, it's nourishment for our system to hear these things."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And the way rain seeps into the land, just lands on the land and seeps in and then the plants take it up as it seeps in, just very naturally."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so let this talk, this information just be like Dharma rain."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You don't have to do anything with it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Like it can go in and perhaps there'll be a moment in the meditation where the conditions are such that, like the plant taking up the moisture that seeps down, the mind sees something in a different way because it's heard this information."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You do not have to think about this talk."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You don't have to figure anything out."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "In fact, just forget about it."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Let it land and nourish you in the way that it does."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "The term that is used in the scriptures is panya-chaku, or the eye of wisdom, or you can, the comparable terms are that of vigya, awareness, and so that it's that awake knowing quality of mind."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "A way of clarifying that is just to use that question, who is it that's aware, and when you, you can leave it as it is, Cathy, so I prefer the dim, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Because when you ask that question in the quietness of the mind, the word who becomes very, very peculiar, right? It's not just an idea that it doesn't apply, but there's a direct sense of, oh, this isn't really a who, it's a what."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So I hope that answers your question, opens up a few more questions."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Well, I haven't been a leper since I was a kid, but I've been a leper since I was a kid."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Well, I haven't been a leper since 1978."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So I can't really talk from direct experience very accurately."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But in essence, you're not really looking for all feelings to be nice."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that one of the most helpful things is to, in a way, to be looking at neutral feeling because about 98% of the feelings that we do experience are neutral."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's the pleasant feeling and painful feelings, only about 2% of the whole lot."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And mostly, I mean, like the feeling of your shirt on your skin, it's neutral."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Or the feeling of your hands on the chanting book, it's neutral."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "The feeling of the breath, it's neutral."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So just developing that attention on neutral feeling and seeing how the world of feeling is experienced, rather than trying to focus particularly on the pleasant or the painful."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Also, as I was saying earlier today, just teasing apart that the quality of, when there is painful feeling, just teasing it apart so that the mind gets to know the difference between the feeling of discomfort or unpleasant feeling and the negativity of attitude towards it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It takes a bit of doing, but if you really explore it, you can see there's something as unpleasant and then there's a kind of a bridge that is crossed where, I don't want it, I hate this, when's this going to be over? And when it's just in the realm of feeling, Vedana on its own, it's quite peaceful, quite innocent really."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And in the teachings on dependent origination, you have sense contact, feeling and then craving."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And it's often pointed out that the weakest link in the chain of dependent origination is between feeling and craving."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so to be able to discern, I don't like is one thing."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And there is a kind of a bridge that's crossed there and that the world shrinks from, I don't like this, this is unpleasant to, I don't want this, how can I get rid of it, when's this going to be over? And to notice the difference between dislike and hating."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Or at the other end of the spectrum, noticing the difference between liking and wanting."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "You might see something that you like or you might hear something that you like and say, well, that's pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And then just noticing how the world shrinks."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that there's a tension there, there's a stressing in the heart that happens."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And just getting to know the difference between I like and I want or I don't like and I hate."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And in a way, developing an awareness of the felt sense of a liking and wanting and feeling how they contrast with each other and similarly disliking and hating."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And by experimenting with that, exploring that, then you can directly know that quality of liking is quite can be quite spacious."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I like it, but I don't have to get it or have it or own it or be looking towards anything at all."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's just, it's just pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "As William Blake puts it, using his 18th century English, he that kisseth a joy as it flies lives in eternity's sunrise."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "He that binds himself to a joy doth the winged life destroy."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "He that kisseth a joy as it flies lives in eternity's sunrise."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So since we're in California, kiss the joy as it flies, you know, option, there's a possibility for bumper stickers there."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But William Blake really had it because that's the, if you try to grab it and own it, then you, you destroy it, you suffocate it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that that's the kind of, we can use our meditation, our ability to reflect and explore, to look at those very feelings."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "There was a hand down here somewhere."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "We've been talking, we've been talking about calmly mind and wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "You mentioned not getting into the area of nihilism."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "We're doing product balance practice."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "We balance it with action."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Does that help without getting into the nihilism? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Well, it's, there's the whole area of how we make effort is very useful to look at and to explore."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Because on the one hand, if we relate to our practice, to practice from self view, I want to become kind."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to become compassionate."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to get concentrated."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to develop insight."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to get rid of my chattering thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to get rid of my afflictive emotions."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to get rid of my doubts and fears and negativity."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And, and that seems like that's what the books are telling us, or in so many dharma talks we hear."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So isn't that what we were supposed to be doing? Right? But the, the mistake that we make is that that the, the practice is getting co-opted by self view."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Like I'm this person who's unconcentrated."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I've got to become concentrated."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I've got these anger problems or these fear problems or these lust problems."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I've got to get rid of my anger, my fear, my lust, and then I'll be a beautiful spiritual person."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so even those, those are wholesome aspirations because they get co-opted by self view."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "What was happening is that the subtle kinds of desire, the desire to become Bhava Tanha and the desire to get rid of the annihilating tendency, they're sort of sneaking around the back door and taking over your efforts at meditation."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so even though we can practice with great sincerity, there's this, this dynamic of I'm a person with problems."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I've got to get rid of, if I get rid of my problems, then I'll be a person without problems."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But there's still got the person there."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And as long as there's the person, it's like the person can't really be freed from the prison because the person is the prison."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And as long as the practice is conceived in I and me, in terms of I and me and mine, then no matter how much effort we put in, how sincere we are, then it's still going to have that frustrating and unsatisfying quality."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But then it can be quite confusing because you can hear this, but what am I supposed to do? Which is a natural enough question."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And when we look at the Buddha's teaching, he, he emphasizes over and over again, this is a path, his teaching is a path of action, it's a path of engagement."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So many of the lists of, you know, the Buddha was the great list maker, as you probably know."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so many of those lists of spiritual qualities, there's the application of energy of effort in the seven factors of enlightenment, the eightfold path, the right effort, the five spiritual faculties and 10 parameters, energy effort is all is always in there."}

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So that's not what I teach."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes?

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that effort is being made, but it's not, it's not being co-opted by the, the habits of self view."}

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And the difficult, the difficulty is they look really like each other."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So the example I always give is like the left and the right hand."}

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so with, with respect to, to developing the practice, just noticing and being really alert to when that I me in mind wades in and is, is sort of intruding."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And then so to recognize that, to know that I making and mind making feeling, to recognize that, oh, this is me practicing my practice."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I should, and in a way highlighting that I and me in mind, getting to know the feeling of Inus and mean us, minus and to recognize that, that I feeling is just another mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's just like the, the weight of your body on the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Just like the feeling of your glasses on your nose."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's just another feeling."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's, it's just another pattern of consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's not, there's no thing really there."}

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's just a, a pattern of, of attitude that arises, passes away."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So when we see that that I and me and my feelings are empty and then have to be bought into, then there's a learning of how to apply effort without the, the me got to become this, me got to get rid of that."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that, and often the easiest way of doing it is just as you catch that attitude forming, you just highlight it like, I've got a problem with fear."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "This is me and my fear problem."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that just by highlighting it, then there's a recognition of, oh, that's not really it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "There's, there's feeling of fear arising in this moment, but does it really have an owner? Who's afraid? What's there to be afraid of?

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But the more that the mind brings the quality of wisdom and mindfulness to bear on it, the more that those self centered habits of thinking and attitude are recognized and the more they're seen and get them front center, they can't stand up in the clear light of day."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Well, there isn't really a concept of soul in Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "In a way, that's one of the defining characteristics of the Buddha's teaching."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And it's interesting that he never actually says anywhere in the entire Canon, there is no self."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "People often say that the Buddha said there is no self."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "He never says that as a categorical statement."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "What he says is that when you, when you look for the self or what, or anything that is self, you can't find anything that that as a qualifies that or defines that or constitutes that."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So the teaching on is the teaching on Anatha is more accurately represented by saying it's a teaching of not self."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So it's in a way, it's by a method of exclusion."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Like you, you're rather than trying to define what you essentially are, you learn to stop identifying with what you're not."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that when he uses that teaching the first time, very, very early on just in the, when he was giving the instruction to his five kind of five companions that he had reunited with after his enlightenment, five friends of his he practiced with before."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "He uses that these, those qualities of Nietzsche, Ducca, Anatha of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not self as a way of, of helping them to, to let go of the habits of identification."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So he says, you know, is the body changing? Is it permanent or impermanent? It's impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And that which is impermanent and changing, is that something that it can be permanently satisfactory or completely satisfactory."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That which is impermanent and unsatisfactory."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Can it be truly said of that? This is me."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So it's a way of analysis that he's, he's describing like exploring identification with the body, the feelings, perceptions, mental formations like moods and ideas and thoughts and then consciousness itself."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so rather than him sort of saying, I declare there is no self."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's like, okay, the things that we normally think of as our self, if they're looked at, they're explored."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "You can see this isn't really who and what we are."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So rather than trying to define what we are in terms of a concept or an idea or a word, his method was to help us to let go of the habits of identification with what we're not."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And then what remains is real, is the reality."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so it's got a lot in, in common with the Christian method, what they call a via negativa, like approaching spiritual reality by defining what God is not rather than trying to define what God is."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that's a particular specific method that he used in meditation, when you try and find out, you know, try and find who, you know, who the watcher is, you end up with this kind of, you know, that you can see that, well, there's awareness, there's knowing, the more that you try to define that or kind of have any sort of personal, give it, find any personal attribute in it, the less you can find."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But it's something to explore."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And rather than taking my word for it to use the meditation to investigate that, because what happens is that, say that the mind is aware of a thought, oh, this is just a thought, this is just a memory."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So this is, this is just Rod remembering."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "This is just Rod's thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And this is the awareness of the words, this is Rod's thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But then at that moment, that you're not pure awareness, there's a thought I am pure awareness that the mind is attached to."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that the practice, particularly the practice of insight meditation is like, as it was staying at the back wall of being that awareness rather than creating an idea."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Yeah, I am infinite consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Yeah, I am the, I am the, the, the, the, the knowing quality of the universe."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That's what, and then at that moment, that knowing quality has been forgotten."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And the attention is latched onto the thought."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And, and so what the Buddha's pointing to in his teaching is that all those I ams, they're going to be wide of the mark."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And the actuality of what is, is essentially indefinable."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And there's a phrase that he uses over and over again, which in Pali is Yena, Yena, Himanyanti, Tatatanghoti, Anyatati."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Whatever you conceive it to be, the fact is always other than that."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And which, and that's a simple principle that any concept is not it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so he was criticized in his own time because he wouldn't come up with some kind of metaphysical description about ultimate reality."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so his, his teachings about ultimate truth are very, very sparse."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And 99% of his attention goes onto the describing the path to realize that truth for ourselves, rather than trying to describe the truth, or describe that ultimate reality, other than you'll say things like, this is the sublime, or it's peaceful, or this is the good."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That's all you get really."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "There's not much to hang anything on."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But most of his attention is these are the things that are obstructing the mind from realizing that truth."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "These are the things that need to develop to sustain that realization."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "These are the pitfalls and the hurdles that are allowable to encounter along the way."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that he was very pragmatic in that approach."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So rather than trying to come up with words to describe the indescribable, he just decided, no, I won't bother, because we're the words can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But the words can point you the way to, to help the mind to awaken to its own nature."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But coming up with a description or a way of characterizing what that fundamental reality is, words don't do it."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So he, he just made that like a kind of spiritual choice in the way of how he would approach teaching."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so that characterizes much of what you find in this particular form of Buddhist teaching."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And I find that when I'm closing my eyes, that's the fastest one-way ticket to India is if you meditate with your eyes open, or is that inadvisable?

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Whatever works is the right thing."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And because the practice is for you, it's not like that we're just subservient."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "We don't need to be subservient to the method."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so it's whatever helps us to wake up and to develop the useful qualities."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And it's going to be different for every single one of us."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So in a way, we each have to craft our own path and seeing what are the things that really benefit, what are the things that don't work, because I can put out some instructions."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And you can say, well, the first couple of things were really good, but that other thing, I don't see that at all."}

{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "You go with what works rather than how things should be."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That note is the discipline of paying attention to the breath and mastery of that component necessary, because I find that I'm more capable as the watcher, if you will, than focusing on the breath."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "The focusing on the breath is just a way to help the attention to stay grounded in the present."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "If that doesn't help, then leave it aside, because it's like if you're already in IRC, you don't need the signpost to get to IRC."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So if you're here already, then okay, you don't need to get here because you're here already."}

{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And I'm going to try to talk about the topic of right relationships."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And how I'm using this term is in the same way that the word right is used for in the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right way of life, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And in fact, one way of looking at the Eightfold Path, all eight of those factors are defining or bringing forth right relationship."}

{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So the intention, the view, the relationships that are complete or full is part of the meaning."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So what would it like for a relationship to be complete, to be whole is part of this question."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And being part of the Eightfold Path, it also, the word Samma also has the apparently etymology of it that goes back maybe before the Buddha's time, has also the meaning of to incline towards, to move towards, like be directed towards a particular direction."}

{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the direction is towards liberation, towards freedom."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And this freedom that Buddhism talks about is very relational in a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And a certain way is trans-relational maybe, or free of relatedness."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And this wonderful kind of richness of the combination of both is part of this fascinating way in which the Dharma practice deepens."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So the way that the Eightfold Path can be seen as being relational is that the first right view has to do with seeing suffering and seeing how suffering comes to be."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Sometimes is seeing the cause, sometimes seeing the dynamics of how it appears, and suffering is always relational."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The suffering that we're looking about, it has to do with the way that we relate to things in the world and to others."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And sometimes when suffering is, we've caused, harm's been caused to us, it's because someone's in relation to us, or the world's in relationship to us, in such a way that there's harm caused."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But in a strict sense in Buddhism, when they use the word suffering, there's a very personal contribution that goes into that, that we want to take into account."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And one of the contributions is that there's clinging, there's attachment to that."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so, and it'd be attached to anything is to be in relationship to that thing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To be attached to anything, you're not free of it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You're kind of entangled or caught in it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And if you can become free of it, that gives the opportunity for us to be related to it, to have a relationship that's very different."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so, there might be no intentional relationship to it in terms of wanting something or intending something."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "When a person's free, then their good will, their love, their compassion can flow."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And that contributes to whatever they relate to, whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And when you're free, you're not being defined by the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "When you're not free, we tend to be defined or shaped or limited by the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Because of the attachments of what we want or what we don't want or what we're resisting and all these things."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, right view has to do with understanding that."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Right intention, the second factor of the Eightfold Path, is clearly relational."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The right view, one way of understanding it, is to relate to things with compassion, to relate to things with kindness, and to relate to things with a very dangerous word in English, concept, with renunciation."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, it's nice to be challenged by these big words."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But the simple way of saying it is to relate to things without projecting our clinging on it, our attachment on it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the renunciation that Buddha always focuses on is not renunciation of things, but a relationship to our clinging attachment to things."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, it's a different relationship with or without clinging."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Right speech is completely relational."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Usually we speak to ourselves, relating to ourselves perhaps, but when we speak out loud, it's usually to other people, and so we're in a relationship with them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And what comes through the speech, how we're relating, what's being created there, what's being done there."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And right speech is speech which is kind, timely, truthful, beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, really you have to look at the relationship and what's kind, what's beneficial for what's happening here."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Right action is usually understood to avoid three actions which you'll understand are very relational."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "One is killing someone, the other is stealing from someone, and the third is engaging in sexual misconduct with someone."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, that's very relational, right? And so as we develop the Eightfold Path, those areas of our relatedness to others begins to shift."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And perhaps rather than having those three awful things happen, it's the opposite that begins happening."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's a reverence for a life, there's a tremendous generosity in not taking but giving, and there's a deep respect for people and their sexual well-being and all that that entails."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then there's right livelihood or like right living which tends to be, for most people, is very related to something."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If not to other people, if you're a subsistence farmer living by yourself, you're still relating to the world and to the land there."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Some of the most beautiful relatedness to the world sometimes is for people who are farming in some kind of harmony with the natural world."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I wrote a wonderful New York Times article this last week about, maybe it was titled, like, A Truce in the War."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it was the war that farmers, I think it might have been in Colorado or in some place, Arizona, that they had with beavers, ranchers with beavers."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And in order to, because they felt that these beavers were causing too much problems, they would blow up the beaver dams."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then this man inherited his father's farm and he thought there's another way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And he started to allow the beavers to build the lead dams."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then he kind of worked with them a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Sometimes he needed to help drain the water and he put pipes in but didn't destroy the dams."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And what happened was that his farm, his ranch, became much more resilient in times of drought and in times of flooding."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The dams, turns out, protected the land tremendously and protected the moisture in the land tremendously."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so now there's a hot movement for ranchers to work with the beavers rather than getting rid of them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So this idea of, you know, being in, how we live our life in relationship to the world."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "What kind of relationship are we living there? And then right effort could be seen as a relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Right effort is mostly very personal, though it has a relational effect."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But it has a lot to do with your relationship to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to really understand in yourself what motivates, what engages you with activity in the world, in yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to have a mind, mental activity that avoids what is unhealthy mental actions and mental activities and do those things which are healthy."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so it means tracking yourself, being mindful of what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Right mindfulness is, you know, maybe a little bit harder to find exactly the rich way but it's the foundation for, allows us to be in relationship to the world in a good way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And right concentration is a phenomenally beautiful way to be related to oneself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's probably one of the most beautiful ways to relate to yourself, to set up this kind of inner life."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To be really settled and deeply concentrated, relaxed and allowing the natural kind of flow of energy within us to kind of flow in a harmonious way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So the Eightfold Path, so the totality of the Old Eightfold Path, maybe we can call right relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And what is the relationship? And some of you know that there's, sometimes there's a category that's, they say there's three things."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's you, there's you, there's others."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And there's the we that exists between them, me, you and we."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But we is a little bit of a maybe abstract idea."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so I like to say that there's me, you and the relationship between us."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And sometimes we need to take care of that relationship more than we need to take care of the other person, more than we need to take care of oneself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I saw this very clearly as I started to have children and I have two sons."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And when they were young, I became clear at some point, the way I hadn't known before, that because I think because my, my wife, maybe if I speak myself specially, I'd done, I'd done a lot of letting go, letting go and study of compassion and caring."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so it was like, just let's, let's take care of this kid for, you know, all costs, whatever, you know, whatever is needed."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And, and my mother would tell me, you're careful, you don't spoil him."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And that didn't mean anything for me."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And later I understood if she don't need to use that maybe a different word."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "She actually was good advice."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But, but what happened, I realized after a while that it didn't really make sense."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "As a child, when the child was, you know, a month old, of course you sacrifice everything for the kid."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Can't do anything for himself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But as they get older and older, you have to pull back and let them kind of more tell to me."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But also became clear as my son got, and the sons got older, there was a we, there was a family unit."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And unless we took care of the family unit, we were going to create a skewed relationship in the family."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And my son wasn't going to learn how to live in harmony with the family unit."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It wasn't all about his welfare and what he wanted, right? That's the recipe for disaster."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But he had to also learn that other people had need and the family had need."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so I think just in time we got some sense of that."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so the we became very important, the family unit."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so that's true, you know, for when there's two people involved or a family involved."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's true when there's a son got involved, a community involved, a town, a city, a nation, a world."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "That there's also the we of everyone."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And how does that, what's the relationship of that? And what's happening there? And what are we contributing to that relationship? And to focus a little bit on the relationship is unusual for some people."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There are some people for whom what they focus on is me, myself, and mine."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Everything is seen through the filter of how this affects me, what I want, what I don't want, how this is impacting me, and how I'm being hurt by this, how I'm a victim for this, how I'm afraid of everything or something."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And there's powerful conditioning forces in our society that really inculcate this kind of you."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's not something we create by ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "This whole focus on me, me, me that can exist is something that's been, some people have been trained by our society."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I mean, like I said in my family, I could see if we weren't careful at some point, that's what we were creating in our son."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And our society with so many different forces is reinforcing self-preoccupation, self-concern, in it for yourself, all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so that's some people's default."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's so strongly in our culture that people don't even know they're doing it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And they're so strong in our culture that it's like second nature for people to be self-concerned, and it's about me."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And they don't even know, they don't even recognize they're thinking that way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's just obvious, and it's obvious, you're supposed to share yourself in some way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then some people are the opposite."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's all about the others."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It can be for young parents like me who are kind of naive, not knowing, and just kind of give everything."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's all about that person, that person."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And some people have religious and family kind of worldviews that really reinforce it's about others, but others are about others, taking care of them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But what is about that third thing in the relationship? And what happens in that relationship? How do we study it? How do we see it? And it's not something we see physically."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And now we're kind of entering into, you know, a little bit the invisible world."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Not like a mystical invisible world or something."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But it's something you don't obviously see."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You have to be attuned to."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You have to pay attention."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You have to pick up the cues."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You have to understand yourself better in order to really understand what's happening here in the relationship to this."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But that also makes it kind of fun."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's a very different way of navigating in the world, surfing along the relatedness rather than engaging the world by asserting oneself or denying oneself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the example that I have for you, you know, no, it's not going to work for many of you, because many of you probably haven't gone surfing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I think it's possible I haven't really tried surfing more than once."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So I don't know what I'm talking about maybe."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But maybe you'll forgive me."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And I'll just use this as an example and hopefully I can."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If you're on a surfboard and you're able to catch that wave, you don't catch it on the wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Now I can just freeze and just kind of ride the wave out and not do anything anymore."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But the wave is dynamic and you're dynamic and everything is dynamic."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so you have to be totally in harmony in relationship to all the different factors at play and shifting and adjusting accordingly the whole time."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And probably one of the reasons it's so fun to be on a surfboard is that self-concern drops away."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Self preoccupation, self-consciousness drops away."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Because you have to be so fully engaged to be right in the present moment to track all the different things going on."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's not just the wave, but it's everything that's involved, including you."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so if there are two different people riding exactly the same wave and one person is really petite and one person is humongous, the size, whatever, they're probably going to ride the wave very differently."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And they might follow the wave just as far, the same distance."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So both of them are managing to do the wave perfectly, but it's going to look very different for these two people."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so the perfect way to ride that wave is going to be different for those two people."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it has to do with the relatedness between what the factors that the individual brings and the factors of the board."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You know, they have different sized boards and it depends what board you have."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Probably the same person riding the same wave on different boards, switching boards every time."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The perfect way of riding the wave is different because it all depends on the board too."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So the person who's doing the perfect ride is in constant conversation, relatedness, with that contributing that relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to stay on the board, but also recognizing what the wave is contributing, what the board is contributing, the whole thing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so it's a dynamic thing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's the combination of all the relatedness, all those things coming together that allows us to do the perfect ride."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So for you living your life, what's the perfect life? What's the perfect way to do things? What's the perfect way to be in a conversation with someone? What's the perfect way of caring for someone? What's the perfect way of doing anything? If you carry an external standard of what that is, I'm supposed to be like someone else, that's the way they do it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The perfect way to be, or in the language of Samma, the complete way to be, the whole way of being in relationship to this situation, has to do with your contributions and who you are and all kinds of things about you as much as it has to do with the situation."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So if you're offering, I train people to do spiritual caregiving as chaplains."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And I tell these people being trained sometimes that if you're a, maybe I usually say unrepentant extrovert, but maybe that's not a good way of saying it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then I follow that by unrepentant introverts."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But what I mean by that is you're completely at home with being who you are."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You don't have to apologize, you don't have to, you know, it's not a crime, it's not anyway."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So someone who is a very strong extrovert shows up to someone who they're offering spiritual care to like a hospital."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The right spiritual care relationship is found in that relationship between them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so the person doing the spiritual care has to be attuned to not only the other person, but to themselves to know where that right way of being is."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And I knew one spiritual caregiver, Jacqueline, who showed up to a very difficult situation and could not really communicate this person who was conscious, but was, you know, had her face to the wall, wouldn't communicate to anyone, was pretty upset."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so the spiritual caregiver started singing Amazing Grace."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If I sang Amazing Grace, I just would sing to my kids sometimes when they were little and they'd tell me to stop."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So, you know, that wouldn't be my way, but that was that person's way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And if someone is in this unrepentant introvert, their perfect spiritual caregiving conversation is going to be very different."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Maybe for them, who they are and what's right, is maybe they sit down quietly and hold someone's hand."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And that's the avenue with which the perfect spiritual caregiving thing happens."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So it's in the relationship between all the factors, not in some abstract idea that we have perfection."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So this is very respectful of yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Imagine, just get to be yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But you have to know yourself well enough to know what you're contributing and to know the situation well enough to know that you're contributing the right thing and you're creating the right relationship in that interaction between them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And if what you're contributing is clinging, grasping, attachment, it's probably not going to be a good outcome."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If what you're committing, bringing into it is cruelty and unkindness, meanness, it's probably not a good relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's not one that you're going to thrive in or it's healthy for you and others."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If it's wrong speech, if there's a lot of complaining and a lot of bit, you know, you're doing kind of verbal stabbing of people with verbal knives about, you know, just kind of get backing at them."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "That's not, you're establishing a certain relationship there."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But if your words are kind, supportive, not mean, not cynical or complaining about something or blaming, a very different relationship gets formed."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the sad thing is sometimes people want to have an unhealthy relationship sometimes because they think they get some benefit from it or something."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to be careful with this relatedness, the right relationship, what do we contribute to it? And one of the principles you find sometimes in Buddhism is the idea that to assert the self is delusion."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But to allow all things to inform you is awakening."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to take you, you know, the self, your self, the key word is assertion, pushing yourself, asserting yourself aggressively, putting yourself up into the world, you know, with clinging attachment."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And that can be done forcefully, but it could also oddly enough in Buddhism, Buddhist terms, we assert ourselves in the world when we are really shy."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "That's just as much, even though it looks like we're pulling back and not doing something, there's still a strong sense of self that we're contributing to the situation."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so what we're learning in Buddhist practice is how to soften and relax all attachment, all clinging, so that we have an opportunity to come forward in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And one of those attachments is excessive preoccupation with self."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "That has been the case since the time of the Buddha, otherwise he wouldn't have been teaching this, not self or non-selfishness that he taught."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But in probably every generation of things, it's gotten worse."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Now, so maybe that's, you know, but, you know, it seems to me it's pretty bad."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to really understand me, myself, and mine, and how much we're self preoccupied in measuring things by the impact it has on us, of course we want to respect ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "We're definitely part of writing the wave, right? But are you contributing a healthy relationship to yourself? And maybe we should not even use the language healthy relationship to yourself, because as soon as you use the word self, it's a magnet for all these cultural, familial, religious ideas of what it means to be a self that we're way down under."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So another way of saying it may be a healthy relationship to all that lives within us."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And free it from this idea of being the self that we have to prove or defend or do anything with."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To be awakened is to be informed by all things."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to be informed by what's within us."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Every thought, every impulse, every feeling, every emotion in this practice is respected."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "We're in a healthy relationship to it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And we don't hold on to it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And oddly enough, we don't celebrate it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Maybe if nothing gets kind of overly evaluated, overly valued, everything is respected, which allows for the birth of this healthy relatedness, this freedom in which things can flow."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the idea that things can flow within us without it being appropriated by self, made into self, measured by self, is a fascinating and delightful and empowering kind of situation to be in."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to begin exploring this world of self, the self thing we do, the attachment to it, not in any blame, not in, now you're a bad Buddhist, you don't become a bad Buddhist by anything that you do and how you are."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You may be never a bad Buddhist."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But where Buddhism is found, and where the health is found, is in the relationship we have with all things, including your relationship to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And some of the relationships that people have with themselves, what's going on here, is very difficult."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's a lot of criticism, sometimes despising on oneself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's a lot of difficulty here."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so, and it's painful, very deep."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so trying to come to a new relationship, find a new relationship where there's compassion and care and kindness, it's a slow process."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But it's helpful to know that this is what we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "We're trying to come to a new relatedness where we're freeing ourselves from the fixed ideas of who we are, and the fixed ideas of this is what perfect is, or this is what imperfect is."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Actually, there's no imperfect or perfect."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If there is perfection in riding the wave, perfect riding the wave, you know how long that lasts? It lasts probably less than a second."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But you don't have any time to congratulate yourself because you're on to the next half seconds and the adjustments for the next perfection."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so with this kind of idea, you know how long you're imperfect? A few of us are occasionally imperfect, right? A little bit, you know? But you know how long it really lasts? It's like the wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It might be true for half a second, unless we're caught in the idea of it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "We're projecting the idea of reliving the idea of imperfect."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But the idea is just an idea."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The idea of the wave is just the idea."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But the wave is always changing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And one of the things we're coming to in this practice of mindfulness is appreciating deeper and deeper the fluidity of the moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "We're always finding our way."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And if you're not finding your way, you'll probably fall off the wave in some ways."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If you get involved in too much retrospective thinking about what I did, you probably fall off the wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to ride the wave of the present moment, and what is the right relationship? What is the relationship that arises when it's informed by everything, within and without? And as we become freer, what we discover is that we don't have to be so self-concerned about how we respond."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The sense of the right response just becomes more and more almost natural."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Of course you're going to be kind."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Of course, or say differently, maybe you'll automatically be kind, but you'll automatically not be unkind."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "You'll automatically become someone."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's very clear in Buddhism they say that once you reach a certain maturity in this practice, you become someone who will never kill intentionally, never steal, never engage in sexual misconduct that harms people."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So there's all these ways in which you don't do all this stuff that's as harmful because that takes work and effort."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And with the absence of that, what is left? And what I love is this tradition, that where it's Buddhist tradition that we're in, it doesn't specify what's left."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's very reluctant to say that what's left is your basic human goodness."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "What's left is love and delight and all that."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Because I think because as soon as you say that, you fall off the wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "As soon as you say that, you're kind of locked on to something, and this is how it has to be."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But rather, there's a deep trust with this maturity of just allowing something to flow through us now that you know is not going to be unhealthy, not going to be harmful."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So that's taken out of the picture."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And then what the response is from the inside might not look like the ideal, might not look what you think it's supposed to be."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But maybe it's the right thing in the combination, the relatedness of you and everything else."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Who knows what that's supposed to be? Who knows what it's going to be sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To come with preconceived ideas limits what might arise."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So to assert the self is delusion."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To allow all things to inform you, or allow all things to inform, allows for health to unfold, the healthy wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So I'd encourage you, if this talk had some meaning for you, that I'm not assuming that what I was saying about the relationship between you and the world, you and others, is an obvious category to understand."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Maybe because it's always shifting."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I'm just going, but there is this relatedness."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There is something that happens in relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it takes a while to begin to become sensitive to it, and attune to it, and appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And with some people it's easier, and some people it's not so easy."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There might be good friends that you can say, there's a new thing I want to understand better."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's not you, and there's me, and there's what happens between us."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And having some friend to help you might make it kind of come alive more and interesting, and make it help you with this new kind of world."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And maybe you'll understand some point very personally."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "To assert the self is delusion."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And to allow everything to inform you is awakening."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So, good evening, and I take it you are not football fans, best basketball fans."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I shouldn't have asked or said anything."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I guess there's a lot of people who normally watch basketball or championship games."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I like it when there's a smaller group."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It gives us a different opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And what I'd like to do is to speak a little bit about thinking in a particular way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then have some time for discussion about these ideas I'm going to present."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So to do this, I'd like to begin with something that maybe is trying to be a poem."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Like spiders, we spin threads of silk."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Like spiders, we weave elaborate webs."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Unlike spiders, we get caught in the webs we make."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Thoughts are fine silk threads."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Thinking is what weaves our webs."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The stickiest webs are please and plots, fears and rats."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Me versus you, me wants you."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Fascinating thoughts to our webs is how we get caught."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And how we become both predator and prey for ourself."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Each thread of thought is thin and weak, dissolving as it appears."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Ten thousand thoughts wrapped around each other make steel chains."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Chains knotted together impossible to untie, here to stay."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But let the next thin weightless, insubstantial thought fly by like you would allow a bird to fly through the sky."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "This is the painless, bloodless sword that cuts your Gordian knot."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So being mindful of thinking is a very useful part of meditation practice or Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And beginning to observe or see thoughts and have a different relationship to thoughts is central to becoming free."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The path of freedom in Buddhism has a lot to do with our relationships with thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's how we relate to thoughts, how we get involved in thoughts, the webs we spin with our thoughts, the ideas, the concepts we create, and then we inhabit worlds of our thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It has a lot to do with how we get caught, how we get imprisoned in prisons of thoughts and ideas and concepts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And to begin to get a different relationship to thinking, to not invest in thinking as that's where we solve all the issues of our life, to be able to recognize that there also can be places of silence in the mind that can create a wonderful spaciousness around our thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Instead of our thinking being claustrophobic in the tight little space of the knots of thoughts that we create and spin and make happen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So we get caught in our webs."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I like the idea that individual thoughts by itself are like fine silk threads, like they call."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I've never touched it, you know, really felt carefully, I think, a spider web thread."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But they call it silk, so I imagine it's, you know, I guess it means sticky too, but must be really smooth or something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And the spiders have little glands on their stomach where they exude, I don't know what it's called, exude, spin out these threads."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it's almost like we have little glands in our brains, and their jobs are to spin out, you know, to exude thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's just what the brain does."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So individual thoughts are just, you know, fine, very thin silk threads, no problem."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And one of the really fascinating things to become aware of is if you're."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Rather than if you're not the emission thoughts in the world of the web of it all, but if you're able to step back enough and have enough stillness or calm or mindfulness of the mind to watch thoughts appear when they appear effortlessly, when thoughts occur and they come unbidden, there was no planning of them, there was no design for them to appear, it wasn't like you just set yourself up to think about something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You're just minding your own business, and suddenly the door opens up, and your mind has a thought, well, that's a door."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I wonder if I left my door at home open."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You know, that thought just kind of wafs through effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Then that might be the thought."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then, well, if I left the door open, it's really hot, the neighborhood raccoons might come in."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They're clever, they probably find their way to the refrigerator."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I think that not only will it be the kitchen BMS, but they might rip up the inside of the refrigerator trying to get that wonderful chocolate cake I have in the back."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's going to be a lot of work to clean up, and I might have to get a new refrigerator."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's going to cost a lot of money, and I don't have a lot of money."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I'd better figure out how to make more money, and maybe I should get a new job."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so we start spinning, at first, a web of this imaginary world of the door being open and what that means."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then we're involved, and we're stuck in it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We're caught up and tied up in what it means and what we're going to do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you spend the whole meditation session solving your work problems and finding a better job."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And by end of meditation, you're going on Craigslist or someplace looking for work."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you go home, and you find out the door is closed."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And what was I doing? That was like a whole trip I took."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I once took a trip like that, and it wasn't continuous, but I think it was probably about seven months."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "That I was spinning this web and caught up in it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it had to do with being the head cook at the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I'd spent a year working in the monastery kitchen, and I was probably at that point the most skilled cook in the whole monastery."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And poise to be the next head cook, the next season."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It wasn't the head cook, it was the guest cook."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So the people who make, when they have a guest season, the people who are going to cook for the guests."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So it was kind of a little bit of a wonderful job."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I thought, of course they're going to choose me when the guest season starts in April."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I spent the winter, every time there was a meal, thinking about the recipe and thinking about menus and thinking about what I was going to do and planning ahead."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you're having meals in the monastery in your meditation posture, so you can meditate kind of around the meal and you finish eating, waiting for the food to be taken away and things like that, waiting for food to come in."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But I didn't meditate, I was thinking thoughts about the wonderful next season when I was going to be this cook."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so this went along merrily until it was time to announce."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they had a formal, almost ritual kind of way where they announced that everyone was in the meditation hall standing there and someone reads out the names and where you're being assigned."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And lo and behold, I was not assigned to the kitchen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And when I didn't hear my name, I was assigned someplace else."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I thought, what was I doing all those months? What a waste of time."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It was like a powerful lesson because like I look back, wow, every meal, I was caught in that web and repeating it and all that."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You know, I could have been doing something useful with my time."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I could have done something that, you know, I could have been meditating."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I was caught in that web."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so, but an individual thought to watch how the first thought sometimes comes effortlessly, the first thought just appears."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "If you're able to see a thought arise and appear by itself and you don't get involved, you don't pick it up, you don't add to it, you just watch it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Then it has the nature of dissolving quickly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And there can be a feeling of freedom in relationship to it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And there can even be a sense of, oh, wow, this mind just does something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "When I was in the same monastery, there was, for a while I was kind of like the altar boy or something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I was the person who was ringing all these bells during the chanting that they do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they had a special ceremony."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They organized a kind of special ceremony."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They had visiting Japanese Zen master dignitaries coming to the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So they wanted to show the Western students, you know, chanting and ringing bells and all that."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was supposed to ring the bells for this ceremony."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And there was a particular sequence in which the chanting is done."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And no one had told me that the sequence had been changed."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So suddenly they started chanting."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I wasn't ready to do that bells and gongs and drums and stuff that had to be done because I was taken by surprise."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I was ready for something else."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So, you know, eventually I started up."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then later the abbot came and talked to me about this."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Because it was his place, right, and he was showing off to the visiting priests."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I explained to him, and all that got out of my mouth was, well, I wasn't thinking that you were going to."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I was a little bit perplexed by that."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But I think his idea was that if I hadn't been thinking, I would have kind of spontaneously kind of joined along."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I would have picked up the change and just kind of just done it without in an effortless way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But I see that often in my mind that there's a lot of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "There's a lot of understanding."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "A lot of wonderful things can happen in that part of the mind where the thoughts arise effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But to go around the day like that and trusting that mind, it's a quieter mind than many active, discursive minds."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But it's still an intelligent mind."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Your intelligence is still there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You remember things and can figure out what to do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It tends to be a mind that's very much in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Because if you watch just there to let the thought arise and then dissolve, you're just left here."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Whereas if you're caught in the web of thoughts, then the web could be about the past, the future, and preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you're kind of in that world as opposed to."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And to see how you can so much of our life in some conventional way can be taken care of in this place where the thoughts arise effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so there's probably all kinds of places you can experiment with this."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I was putting the dishes in the dishwasher machine this evening."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And there were those thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "If you put it there on that side of the rack, you can get more."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "That's the efficient place, and then you can put those over there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Very simple, innocent thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I wasn't thinking them in terms of I was the one actively thinking and planning."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "If I thought my family was watching and I was going to show them that I'm the best dishwasher machine filler in the world, and then I'm really involved, then I'm caught in the web of something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But no one was in the kitchen, so there was no showing off."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it was just something that I do regularly, putting it in there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I could watch that there were very simple thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The thoughts were so distant and quiet."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And if I was involved in other thoughts, I wouldn't have been recognized that I was thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I would say I was an automatic pilot putting the dishes in."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But because I was somewhat quiet, I could see this very subtle quiet thought just arise and pass."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I wasn't doing them, but they were a little bit useful."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They helped me line up the plates and stuff in a more efficient way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "What I'm trying to say is that there is a functioning of the mind that can happen that doesn't require your self-conscious involvement in thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "If we're caught in thought, in the web of thoughts that we create, chances are very high is that we're self-consciously involved."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We have desires and aversions."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We're trying to get away from something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We're trying to make something happen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We're concerned about something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And a major player in all those concerns is me, myself and my mind."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it gets really sticky."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And that stickiness makes it sometimes very hard to pull ourselves away from thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's possible with a quiet enough mindful mind to feel the stickiness or to feel the gravitational pull into thoughts, or to feel the push or the drive or the energy to be in thoughts, to be concerned with thoughts, to go to thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you see it's a meditator to see it because you let go of your thoughts to try to go back to your breathing or be in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then the next thing you know, you're back in your thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And after a while, you can feel the energy of being pulled into it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Or maybe it takes a lot of effort."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You try to stay on the breath."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you could feel the pull or the attraction or even the interest or the lawyers of the mind coming along to debate saying, this is really important."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you can feel that tug that's there, the stickiness that's there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You can feel how hard it is to pull away in the glue that might be there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I don't know if those metaphors of stickiness and glue work for you, but you can feel a little bit that relationship that you have with the thoughts that keep you engaged, keep you caught in it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I think for people who haven't done some kind of meditation or really kind of studied their mind carefully, it can be very compelling to think because that's all we have is the only kind of tool we kind of maybe have to figure things out and to solve problems and to get ahead and to, you know, get pleasure or distract ourselves from our difficulties or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "All kinds of reasons we think."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so it's serving a purpose."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And we have the idea this purpose is really important."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's really important to do these things."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The promise of thought, if I think it through, I bet a fair number of you have ruminated around the same kind of concern over and over and over again."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And you only do it because some part of you believes that somehow, if you do it, you'll get a solution."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Somehow something will happen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And, you know, if I just think about menus and recipes for six months, you know, somehow I'll end up being the cook."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so this can go on and on and on."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so some of these kind of webs of thoughts that we get caught in are labyrinths or maybe not labyrinths, labyrinths or, I guess, mazes."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We go into the maze and it's very hard to find our way out."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Especially if we're trying to think our way out."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Because we're still in the maze if we're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We're still in the web if we're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so sometimes it can feel impossible to get out by ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And that's why some people will do dramatic things, or not so dramatic things, to distract themselves because their thinking mind is so painful and so incessant."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so some people will, you know, do alcohol and drugs to somehow break the cycle of those kinds of difficult thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Some people will do all kinds of recreational things, sometimes sex, sometimes exercise, sometimes watching movies or something just to get out of their own mind."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Because it's so difficult in there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "In the path of mindfulness, we're learning to look at that directly and learn to relax."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And relax the mind, relax the tension, relax that pull or that drive, that investment we make in the world of thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So we can have a very different relationship we're thinking and not have it so sticky."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Not to be so pulled into their webs and cotton those webs."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "We spin our own webs that we get cotton."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they can seem, as a poem says, we get a lot of these thoughts, you know, coming together."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they don't feel like thin, weak little threads."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But when all these thoughts go fast and furious or come all together or have been building for, you know, years, kind of weaving a fantastic web, they feel like they're hard and solid steel chains."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they tie themselves in knots."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it's impossible to break them."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "People don't even know how to get into them or find their way in them."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so the poem has this very simple way, the sword that cuts the Gordian knot, the painless, bloodless sword."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Isn't that nice? And that has to, if you're able to discover how to see thoughts arise effortlessly and not get involved."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And just like you watch a bird go through the sky, you allow it to go through the sky."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't put your hand up and say stop."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You don't throw sticky glue, long threads of sticky glue on them or something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You just kind of, they just go through."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "In terms of your mind, the birds go through the mind kind of through the sky of the mind, sky of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They just go through and there's no effort, nothing for you in there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so to let the thoughts go through the sky of the mind and just fly away, disappear."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Don't add thoughts to them."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And to watch those effortless thoughts appear and glide through and dissolve."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Just to really observe that, that cuts the knot."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "That puts you on the other side or that puts you apart from this whole complex web and knots that thinking creates."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then trust, really trust that mind that was able to watch the thoughts arise effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's the mind, the awareness that can watch that happen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "That's where freedom begins to be found."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's not very promising or it doesn't seem very, it might seem out of scale with the tremendous importance of these webs of thoughts that we have to think and the important things our life have to do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's just very, it's very humble."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "To just the mind that's able to watch."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The mind that's like the sky that the bird goes through."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "The mind that goes, oh, that's a thought."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It arises and it dissolves."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then if you can go through your days trusting that awareness, you might be able to discover the joy and the amusement and the wisdom and the specialness of having a whole, watching all these effortless thoughts arise that take care of you and help you find your way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And there might be sometimes we have to intentionally think and get engaged."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's not a crime, I think, you know."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But to be able to kind of have this effortless quality support you, guide you, be a source of understanding in you."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And, you know, just, wow, there's something else operating here that's supporting me."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "That is not me in terms of the usual me that I identify and hold myself as being me."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's still coming out of you, but it's not the you that we kind of have created this wonderful, we've ensnared in our webs."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And perhaps the self that the Buddhism is talking about unwinding, dissolving, is just a complicated web, spider web, that we've spun for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so to take, pull out the threads and let it all unravel is freedom."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So that's maybe more than I wanted to say, or longer than I wanted to say."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I don't know if this makes sense to you, some of all of yours."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I think that to be able to really see and track thoughts and see what's going on there is a foreign thing for some people that they haven't learned it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But that's something that comes over time as you do mindfulness practice and keep meditating and start looking at this and start seeing there's actually a very radical different way of living that for some people is a revolution in their minds, a life that's not rooted or centered in thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You can still think, but it's not centered on it."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But centered more in this awareness, they can see the arising and dissolving of thoughts and make lots of room for this effortless place of thinking to occur."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "One of the advantages of this is that if we're caught up in the web of thinking a lot, there's not a lot of room for other forms of thoughts to arise."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "If you have quiet in the mind and so you have enough to watch track the effortless thoughts arise, all kinds of things can appear."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You'll be surprised what arises and what shows itself and what informs you."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's actually a richer, bigger world to live in in that world."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So we spin the webs that we ourselves get caught in."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And to step back and watch the next thought arise effortlessly is maybe how we dissolve the web."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Do you have anything in your life, you have any experience, any history with thinking where you recognize for yourself, yes, that time, 20 years ago, last week, this afternoon, I spun a web of thoughts and ideas and all that, and then I lived in it, I was caught in it, I was trapped in it, I couldn't pull myself out."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Do you have any experience of that, and what was that like, and how did you get out? And do you have any experience of what I'm talking about, about having an effortless thought arise where it didn't really seem like it was you, but you weren't channeling anybody either, it was you, it was clearly your mind."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But it was a quieter voice maybe, or a quieter projector or something, and it just came and was there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Do you have anything in your experience that you can relate to what I've been trying to say today? So what I'd like to ask you to do is to maybe form little groups of three or four people, and you don't have to share anything that's too personal."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But why don't you share anything that you have any personal experience of what I'm talking about?."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So, today I'll talk about the seventh factor of awakening, equanimity."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "You know, they call it the crowning jewel, though to me it feels like they're all the crowning jewels."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So, I'd like to begin with a teaching that the Buddha gave his son, Rahula."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "He said, Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "For then, agreeable and disagreeable, sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Just as when people throw what is clean and unclean on the earth, feces, urine, saliva, pus or blood, the earth is not horrified, not humiliated or disgusted by it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "In the same way, agreeable and disagreeable, sensory impressions will not take charge of your mind when you develop meditation like the earth."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Equanimity points to a balanced mind and evenness of mind, a mind that stays open regardless of circumstances."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a rich, warm, satisfying state of mind."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's not just neutral, but it's a really wholesome state."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a connection with ourselves."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It doesn't resist the unpleasant and doesn't cling to the pleasant."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And it comes naturally any time the hindrances are suspended."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Some years back, I read a book that really inspired me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a biography of the nun, Tenzin Palmo, called Cave in the Snow."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Some of you, I'm sure have read it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She's a contemporary Tibetan nun originally from England."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She spent 12 years living in a cave high up in the Himalayas."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The cave was six by 10 feet and she spent three years of it in full retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She slept sitting in meditation in a wooden meditation box for three hours each night."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Her last years were in complete isolation."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It was way up in the Himalayas we'd get like 30 below at times."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But that's not what really inspired me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She grew some of her own food but she depended on the villagers to bring her enough food for each winter because the roads were often closed for six months or more."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And every year, a villager would show up with her food in a cart and they'd show up in a timely manner."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But one year, he didn't come."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And the roads were closed with the weather and she wasn't sure she'd survive the winter."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She did have some turnips left and I guess she must have grown those."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And she barely survived but she just kept practicing."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And what really impressed me though is that she never complained to the villagers about not getting group delivery."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She never bothered to find out why."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The next year, the delivery came as expected."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "That's, that was an inspiring level of equanimity for me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So developing equanimity affects every aspect of our lives and relationships and it's an essential part of developing the mind."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's the state of staying balanced in the face of what we call the eight worldly winds or the eight vicissitudes."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They're called the worldly winds because they easily toss us around."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And they're all very familiar to all of us."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Pleasure and pain, gain and loss, praise and blame, and fame and disrepute."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Most of us want the four pleasant ones and then want the other four."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And despite that life continuously shows us otherwise, we tend to believe if we just do everything right, if we're smart enough and try hard enough, we'll just get the four we like."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And daily life is placed out in just countless of ways."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "For instance, pleasure and pain are at the center of our addictions."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The little reward of pleasure the brain gives us when we check mail or crave something to eat that may not be so good for us."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And we're all familiar with physical pain, gain and loss, getting what we want and being deprived of what we want."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And praise and blame, it can be over big things or over little things, it can be deserved or not."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "If boss might say one day you did a great job and then you feel great and then another time criticizing you and you feel bad."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "In the Dharmapada that Buddha noticed, they find fault in one sitting silently."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They find fault in one speaking much."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "No one in the world is not found at fault."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "No person can be found who has been, is or will be only criticized or only praised."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And the last one, Feynman's Disrepute, these are the words of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And the last one, Feynman's Disrepute, these are the, they're Olympic athletes that see themselves as failures if they get the bronze."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So these are, we definitely get incredibly tossed around by these worldly winds."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "When I first learned about the worldly winds, I only thought of them in relation to my daily life."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But as I start paying attention on retreat, I realized they easily, easily show up on retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I'm sure many of you have been easily tossed around by pleasure and pain at some point on retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My body feels good, I'm happy."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And another time I back hurts, my knee hurts, I can't practice."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Pretty familiar territory for some of us, or maybe in practice, you've experienced being tossed around by gain and loss."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My concentration was so good, it was just so good."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And then later I was completely distracted, would I do wrong? And sometimes we're tossed around by praising blame ourselves, congratulating ourselves on being such a good yogi."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I kept the schedule really well, I showed up to everything."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I was mindful all day long."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And then another time, berating ourselves for not trying hard enough."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "You know, unfaithful in this repute, I'll share a little story that happened to me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I was on a long residential retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I was a couple of weeks deep into the retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I had shaved my head at the beginning of the retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I really wanted to let go, I wanted to renounce."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I was moving slowly, mindfully, standing in line for food."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I always wore shawl in those days."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And as I reached for this completely full serving picture of a delicious, oily, creamy dressing that I loved, my shawl caught and the entire picture full of slimy mess fell on the wooden floor."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I froze, you know, all 100 eyes were on me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "For a moment, you know, I just had this flush of embarrassment coursed through me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Everyone was looking at me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Everyone was seeing how unmindful I was."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My mind went from shame to noticing how much I cared what people thought of me and how painful that was."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It was so important to me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But in the spaciousness of meeting that, meeting that with equanimity, it's something in me really relaxed."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I was just, and all of a sudden, just this very sweet laughter arose in me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I laughed at myself a lot of warm affection."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "There, in Pali, there are two different words that are translated as equanimity, which points to two different aspects of it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And to me kind of points to ways of practicing with it also."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Upeka, which is what many of us have heard, means to look over or have an overview."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's like being able to observe an experience without being caught by it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We see the whole picture, we understand it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So it's kind of the overview."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I have a good friend that would always be late to everything."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We got in the habit of telling him that everything was earlier than it actually was, like an hour earlier."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So we figured that would get him there on time."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And one day he was over the house and a few of us were going for a hike."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And lo and behold, he was ready to go on time."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "You know, so everyone else went to the car as he and I went to put on our shoes."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But just as we're walking out the door, a poetry book I had on the shelf caught his eye."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And he picked it up and just delightedly started reading it oblivious to his waiting friends."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "This is how our minds tend to work."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We can easily pick up whatever comes away regardless whether it's helpful or not."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But if we have a big picture, we keep in mind our friends are waiting in the car."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "What distracts us in meditation, right? A thought coming by."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And we pick it up just like that book, just like that book, forgetting why we're meditating, forgetting that freedom is waiting for us in the car."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The other word for equanimity, which I likely mispronounce, but just know that I do so with that most equanimity."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It means to stand in the middle of all this."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I love that definition."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's just really standing in the middle of our lives."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's being centered in the middle of our experience."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And that kind of leads you to see how concentration, which Gilles talked about yesterday, how that leads to equanimity."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Because when their mind is unified and samadhi, the hindrances aren't there."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It will not pull them pushed by them."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And that being the center naturally leads the mind to be able to abide in that balance, that equanimity, or ride in the middle of all of it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "As we gradually develop these seven factors of awakening, and we live in our lives, a balanced life of blamelessness and inter-tegrity, or inner strength and stability, that grows in us and what we have is unshakable balance."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We're like a tree with deep roots that's not easily blown about by the strong winds."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Ride in the middle of all this."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Every wholesome state we experience has equanimity in it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Equanimity allows us to investigate a hindrance without rejecting it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Something I think I've mentioned more than once, just how we approach a hindrance needs to be wholesome."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And that's the equanimity that's, you know, we're balanced and yes, I can see this."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It helps us accept all the difficult parts of ourselves that are challenging to meet."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Another way that we develop equanimity, some of us are familiar with practicing with the Brahma Viharas."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They're known as the Four Unmeasurable, or Four Divine Abodes."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Loving kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity is the fourth one."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "But I like the way Gil referred to them once, the four faces of love."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I think that's really sweet."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a wonderful way to think of these."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Equanimity is another aspect of this unrestricted love towards all beings."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "As we develop it, it allows the heart to live with an unconditional love."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It helps us develop a deep acceptance of full range of humanity, including all the beings that are really, have been challenging to love and develops a heart that's like the sun that shines on everyone."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And that's a freedom of the heart."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "A heart that doesn't say, no, I have to stop shining for a little bit."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "That person isn't deserving."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a heart that just shines for everyone."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Equanimity supports all of the factors of awakening."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "As they become strong, we develop deeper and deeper insight."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "This is the deeper work of meditation."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We begin to understand the truths of change, not only conceptually, not just idea of change, but in the very direct experience of things rising, passing away."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We experience in our bones the truth that everything is just dissolving right in front of us."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "We experience the truth of dukkha, that all phenomena are unsatisfactory and everything arises and dissolves."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And there's no place for the self to take a stand."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Nothing lasts long enough to be called a self because that too dissolves."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Whatever has the nature to rise passes away."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "What would it be like if we really let this in? That's everything in our experience."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "If our understanding were complete, we wouldn't hold on to anything."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "In the Anapanasati Sutra, the Buddha said, one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "When we consider equanimity as balance and centeredness, it makes it immediately accessible at any time, on or off the cushion, because at any moment we can just be centered."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It just takes one moment to take a breath and to connect with our body."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The body at the center, this is an embodied practice."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Maybe we connect with the breath or a soft belly, connecting with our body in any posture or any situation we're in."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "You can naturally find our center and that connection is the thread of our inner strength."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The strength to become like a tree with deep roots that's not easily blown about by strong winds."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I'll tell you one more little story."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My husband and I set a three-month retreat at IMS a couple of decades ago."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "This was in the olden days of residential retreats."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "On the last day of retreat, to facilitate the ending of the retreat, the managers decided to change the lunch schedule."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Normally, there was just one group eating at noon."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They decided there'd be two groups and they'd split them by the alphabet."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They posted the day schedule."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It said 12 noon was 8 o'clock."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They accidentally left out H through L."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My husband, with all the wisdom of a yogi after a three-month retreat, took a pen and added H through L equanimity practice."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "As Gilbert reminded us this morning, in many ways the practice is simple."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Be here, pay attention, and let go."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "In a way, the rest of the teachings, as beautiful as they are, are different ways of pointing to that."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So I'd like to end with a poem by Kozan Ichigyo, a 14th century seasoned monk."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Empty-handed, I entered the world."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Two simple happenings that got entangled."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Empty-handed, I entered the world."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Two simple happenings that got entangled."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So let's share a couple of minutes of silence."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So my deep commitment to mindfulness was really challenged this evening on the way here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I was so grateful that you were here because it allowed me to become more mindful as I came into the room."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it was a very precious moment to, excuse me, to arrive."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I had mentioned to the center earlier that the Donna for this evening, please donate it back to the center."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "They're doing such good work here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I really want to support them to establish this center."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So my offering, whatever you would offer to me, is going back to the center this evening."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I was thinking a lot about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I've had a lot of different experience of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I was thinking if I was going to share some of the most important things that have made an impact on my life and practice that would be a benefit, possibly, for you in coming here this evening, what would I want to share? And I'll start with a story."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "A number of years ago, 20-some odd years ago, I was at a retreat center and it was this way up in the redwoods."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And there was a wonderful teacher coming from India."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it was his first time in America."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And all of the retreat people, the people who'd been studying for many, many years, done a lot of Dharma practice, done substantial retreat, had cleaned the center and prepared and organized and got the word out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so it was a very big deal to welcome the teacher."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he was going to spend three days teaching on mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And in the Tibetan tradition, which is a, I call it the Rokoko of Buddhism, we have everything you would ever want in Tibetan Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't leave anything out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, the bells, the whistles, the drums, the incense, the pretty pictures, the dances, we put it all in there."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it's a very rich tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as with all of Buddhism, in all traditions, mindfulness is the foundation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Mindfulness is the place that you start with that provides the solid base."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so here was a group of very, very experienced vajrayana practitioners who'd done a lot of practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And they were really kind of feeling proud, you know, to welcome this very high lama into their center to teach them about mindfulness, because they knew all about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it was one of my first times at the center."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it's kind of watching this whole thing unfold."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he took the seat and he says, well, he could talk for a little while about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he says, well, let's just try to practice a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so everybody got real settled in on their cushions and fixed their little seats and carved out their little meditation turf, as meditators like to do, and settled in."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he said, well, let's just start slowly."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Let's just try to sit for 15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And people were kind of looking around the room like, are you kidding? I can do that in a heartbeat."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You can sort of see the little wheels clicking like, oh, I've done so much retreat."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we sat in silence for 15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then he cleared his throat."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And everybody kind of opened their eyes and looked around."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "He says, OK, don't be discouraged."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Mindfulness, it's really tough."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So he talked for a little while longer."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "He says, OK, let's try it again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So they thought, well, what's going on here? I'm slipping here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So people sat up and focused in and closed their eyes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And 10 minutes passed in silence."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he cleared his throat again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he said, well, it's really good to start somewhere."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I really appreciate all the effort you're putting into this."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This is really, really good."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this takes years and years of practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then people are looking around going, why am I? What's going on? What are we missing here? So he talks for a little while longer."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he says, OK, let's try it for five minutes this time."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Don't worry if you can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So people thought, well, I can do five, at least five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So the entire room is a big room full of people, very crowded, sat down for five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And at the end, he cleared his throat and he said, you know, in Tibet, we start with a minute at a time."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it was a really interesting moment for me because what I realized is so often in the West, we want to do it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we want to do it right."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we want to assume the pose."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we want to have the accoutrements."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we want to have it all figured out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But the real practice starts in just little tiny steps."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And just as when we learn to walk, we have to take a step at a time."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Meditation practice is like that as well."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And even for experienced practitioners stuck in rush hour traffic who forgot to get gas and bridge toll and needed to have thought, OK, whatever is my mindfulness right now, you know."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And there's always an opportunity to practice every moment of every day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it's very interesting because I've thought about him many, many years and I didn't know this teacher's name."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I knew his title, Tibetan Practitioners."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We have a lot on venerable this or holiness that or Rinpoche that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But the teaching really stayed with me of what it means to lay a foundation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And over the years, I've seen the benefit of you start slowly, slowly, a minute at a time and you begin to know that you can do a minute and then you might expand it to three where you're fully aware in those three minutes and your mind isn't water here or there, but to be fully, fully present and not in a forced way or not in a sleepy way where we can sometimes be mindful but we're kind of nodding off a little bit but in a very, very gentle, fully cognizant way to be present."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then slowly we expand it to five and then 10 and then 15."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And that begins to set the foundation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we're always setting the foundation every day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Every day is a different day and a new day with new things that come up."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So each day we sit, there's always an opportunity to do it again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We always get a chance for a do-over and that's the beauty of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It's not as though you progress always in a straightforward line."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Sometimes you go forwards and people who've been meditating for a long time, sometimes you go way, way back before you go forwards again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Sometimes you go in circuitous routes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It's a real practice and a real commitment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so that was one of the first stories that I thought of that really, really impressed me because it also gave a lot of permission that some days it's just not coming together in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's things going on within the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's places to go, people to see, to do lists."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And yet it's like, well, maybe I don't have 20 minutes in me."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Can I really, really sit mindfully for five today? And maybe those five minutes expand or maybe they give just enough to carry the practice forward in the rest of the day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So that was one of the first real important impressions for me about what is practice in terms of a gradual step."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I thought, you know, it's just like exercise."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when you want to exercise and you want to get your tone, you don't go out immediately and start running the 5K race."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You, you know, do some things so you don't injure yourself."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You start off slowly, slowly."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And you build your stamina and you build your concentration and you begin to find your root and you find your pace."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And after you begin to develop this routine, then you begin to expand it and you get more muscle tone."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And meditation is very similar."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't always, I think in this culture we don't, we're not always aware of how our consciousness is a muscle that we actually do exercise every day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We, but there's different ways you can exercise it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "For example, we exercise it by the thoughts that we have running through our mind throughout the day while we're at work."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, oh, that person gave me that deadline."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, I don't have time for that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "What is she wearing that to work? She shouldn't be dressed that way, you know."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, I can't believe my boss spoke to me in that tone of voice again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We always have this internal dialogue going on and on, which is where our consciousness is."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It's where our mind is living at the moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when you do a mindfulness practice on your meditation seat, that's the foundation that you begin to create so that when you get off your meditation seat and you begin to walk out and engage with the world, with your friends and family and coworkers and community, that you can take some of that awareness with you in your interactions."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And why would we want to do that? Well, when we're more mindful, we're at choice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "If we're caught up in the emotions of a situation, if we're caught up in the thoughts or judgments or our criticality or feeling like we're not enough, whatever that internal dialogue is that we often have going on, it actually takes us out of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when we're not in the present moment, we're not fully engaged with the person or the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And if we're not fully engaged with the person or the situation, we're not going to bring forward all of who we are in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We're going to bring forward our thoughts, our reactions, different feelings that we might have that might not even bear on the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We're not fully present to who is in front of us or how we're really being touched and moved."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so the foundation for the mindfulness practice we do on our seat is to then take that into another level and to begin to practice that awareness, not from sort of zombie disassociation way, like, oh, I'm being mindfully aware of my conversation with you."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Nobody wants to engage with the zombie."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You just don't feel that connection."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But you want to be present, you want to be yourself, and you want to be aware, how am I feeling in this moment? Am I aware of my breath? Am I aware of this person opposite me? What is really being triggered? Am I fully listening if I'm being triggered? Can I put that aside? Can I be fully present again? And so you have the opportunity to, each time you drift away, to then bring yourself back in the interaction."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Each time you start to go off or become distracted or judgment arises or opinions arise or emotions arise to say, but I'm not fully present in this moment with this person."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So you just have the opportunity to keep bringing yourself back to the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "All the traditions of Buddhism have mindfulness within their practices and mindfulness in many ways is, I think, a practice that's probably within all major spiritual traditions."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we talk about it as, in the Tibetan tradition, we talk about it as mind training or lojong."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the purpose of the mind training is to not only start to become aware of where is my mind in any given moment, but how to begin to make new choices."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "For example, if I'm a person who gets very irritated and very angry all the time, then the antidote to that would be to cultivate more patience."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So for example, if being in rush hour traffic and hitting 90th Avenue and the street lights aren't timed, and I'm hitting every single stoplight, it's really an amazing practice to stop and say, where am I in this moment? I'm really irritated."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Can I move forward and find that piece? And the next time I'm stopped, what is the choice I'm going to make about my irritation? Because there's always a choice in where we lose our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We can allow our mindfulness to slip away from us, and we can always allow ourselves to choose to bring it back again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There was another story that I had thought of and that I wanted to share with you, and this was a story that also deeply, deeply impressed me."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This was maybe about 10 years ago in Los Angeles."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "His Holiness the Dalai Lama was invited to give a talk."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And at the end of the talks, he sometimes invites the audience to write questions on a piece of paper, and they put it in a basket and somebody sorts through them and gives it to him to read and answer for the audience."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So he was about 3,000 or 4,000 people in this huge auditorium, and he was in the middle of this auditorium seated and his picking questions out, and he picked one out and he read it in English because he speaks fairly good English, and he said, what is the fastest way to enlightenment? And everybody laughed."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And everybody, you know, people just thought, oh, this is so funny, you know."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he was, when his Holiness laughs, he shakes, he kind of jiggles up and down, his whole body gets into it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so he was kind of like this, and the audience was roaring with laughter, just one of those moments."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I looked around the room and the Tibetans were like this."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "They were looking at the floor kind of with their heads down and their hands folded in their lap and very, very quiet."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I thought, wow, what are we missing? And suddenly we realized that his Holiness was crying."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And in that moment, the entire room was there's like the collective gasp of, oh my God, you know."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And for Tibetans to see Ahayelama cry is, it really takes them to the core of their being, of recognition of what it is they have done, what is the impact of what they have done."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I talked to somebody afterwards about it, and he said, a Tibetan would never ask that question."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it was interesting because his Holiness said, you know, enlightenment is not easy."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he said, I'm crying because, you know, of course we all want release from our suffering, and we all want the quick fix, and we all want peace, and we all want happiness, and we all want compassion, and we want it to all come together."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the good news is that there's plenty of time to do it because if we really had one lifetime to do it in, where would we fit it in with everything else that we're doing between raising families and getting educations and paying off mortgages? And so there's an opportunity to learn to practice in a way that's realistic within this lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So I thought about those two stories, and I thought it's interesting because both of them, in a certain sense, gave a lot of permission that it's okay to not know everything right out the gate."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You don't need to get fully enlightened."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You don't need to have mindfulness down like that in one lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's an opportunity to build a really solid, solid foundation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we go to 9 o'clock, right? One of the things that I wanted to do this evening was to do a guided practice on working with emotions, emotional states, and mindfulness for you to have the experience of what it's like outside in the world every day, but to begin to incorporate mindfulness in your daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And again, the reason to do this is to begin to familiarize ourselves with those moments when we're swept away in the heat of the moment, and sometimes it's easier to bring ourselves back when we're seated on the cushion, but it's not so easy to do it in the midst of a discussion with a friend or maybe an altercation with somebody in a line at the bank or in the midst of being cut off and full of traffic."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So what I'd like to do is to do a guided meditation practice on mindfulness in this moment, so if you could get comfortable again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this may or may not be familiar to some of you to have a guided meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so what it is is that as you go into meditation, I'm going to guide you into different states, and then I will bring you back to this moment now with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you go into these places that I'll guide you into, I'll ask you to pay attention to sensations in your body, thoughts that may be arising."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "What are you noticing in this moment? So the more that you practice going away and coming back, especially with an intense experience, then you'll begin to familiarize yourself with that as you go out into the world as well as an opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So I'd like you to get as comfortable as you can and close your eyes for this."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And can everybody hear me okay? A nod will suffice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I'd like you to first come back and feel your body, the sensations that are arising, feeling supported by your chair or if you're on the floor, your cushion."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And to notice the support beneath you and then also if there's any tension or if you need to shift a little bit to come into focus and relaxation to just do that gently."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And to focus on your breath."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Your in and out breath very, very gently and softly."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you bring your awareness to your breath, your awareness should be as gentle and focused as if a butterfly was lighting, landing on your lapel, very, very gentle."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you focus on your breath, I want you to think back to a recent situation where you were really triggered, very, very activated, irritated, maybe upset."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Could be with a person or a situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I want you to fully experience that in your body at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And if you hear the words that were said or see the image of what really irritated you to just watch that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Just watching from a place very gently, witnessing the scene."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you experience the emotions that arise in the body and the intensity, just notice where they are."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Are they hot or cold? Hard, soft, shaky? Do they move around or stay in one place? Remembering to breathe in and out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And notice if there's a conversation going on in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The words that are being said."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Are they critical, judgmental, passionate? Remembering to breathe gently and just watch where you are, how uncomfortable they are."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And look at where the mind is."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Is it strategizing, planning for the next thing to be said or done? Is it looping, going in circles endlessly on what you could have said, should have done, or what they could have said, or should have done? Remembering to breathe."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Now come back to this moment, this room."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This time, that moment is over."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Come back to the body, the sensations."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And if your mind wanders back to the situation or conversation, come back to the in and out breath very gently and kindly."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you follow your in and out breath and awareness now, ask yourself this question."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How will I do it differently next time? What choice will I make if this ever happens again? And ask the question and just breathe in and out slowly and gently and wait and watch and notice what comes up."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Come back to your breath in this moment, the in and out breathing, and your body, the sensations, the sounds in the room, cars going by."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when you're ready, open your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There are so many, many teachings on mindfulness and so many books on mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it's so easy to read them and relate to them because they make sense and they touch us."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We think, I want to do that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the practice of doing it sometimes in the real moment, in the heat of a challenging situation is real warrior work."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It's work that takes us into the core of who we are to show up differently in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the opportunity that we have in those challenging moments is if there's a window where we suddenly realize I have been swept away and I'm in it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But if I can come back to this breath and this moment, I might have the opportunity to make a different choice in the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Maybe and maybe not, but the more that we practice, the more that we are gentle with ourselves in those moments when we are swept away, we can also extend gentleness to the people around us as well."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the more that we can accept our own humanity of being fully endowed with this wide, wide range of emotions that we don't want to shut down."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to go numb and we don't want to indulge them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to get so taken off track that we create train wrecks wherever we go in our emotional or relational lives."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But the more that we can stay fully present and awake and aware, those are the moments we have an opportunity to have a different conversation or a different resolution or maybe unforeseen possibilities that we hadn't even considered, but because we did not go to the place of habitual pattern or habitual reactivity, we're able to entertain something new and different."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So having a guided meditation gives you an opportunity to be the passenger going along into an experience."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And what I'd like to encourage you to do in the next few days is if you're out and you have a situation that comes up where you recognize, oh, I'm really in it right now to think, okay, what was it that she said? And what I'd like to say is if you can always come back to the breath and remember to focus on your breathing because the good news is that when you're breathing and focused on your breathing, you're not time traveling to the past and you're not leaping forward to the future because we can't breathe in the past and we can't breathe in the future."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when we focus our mind on this present moment now, we're remembering that what has already occurred is over and done with and there's nothing we can do about it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "That situation is finished."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But this new situation, if we're fully aware, we have an opportunity to bring more of ourselves to it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I know that we're getting ready to wind our evening down and before we do questions and answers, I'm a person who's really big on resources, so I brought a bag of books with me."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this is just a few of the things that are out there, but I wanted to let you know that if you want to learn more about sort of taking your meditation into a new place in terms of mind training, there's phenomenal resources out there in all the Buddhist traditions."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So most of these that I have are from the Tibetan tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's different schools in the Tibetan tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's a really, really wonderful one by Thich Nhat Hanh called Understanding Our Mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And you're all welcome to come up and flip through these at the end if you'd like."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But I just wanted you to have resources if you're interested and you want to pursue this further."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "One of my favorites because it has so many teaching stories in it is the collected teaching of Ajahn Chah called Food for the Heart."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this is just beautiful, beautiful stories and anecdotes of meditators and meditation practices and learnings that they had from their interactions with a truly remarkable teacher that I wish I had met in this life."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this is also from the Theravada tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the forward is by Jack Cornfield with an introduction by Ajahn Amaro."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Has he been here before? Yeah, yeah, he's wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then in the Tibetan tradition, there's a wonderful book called The Seven Point Mind Training or The Practice of Lo Zhong, which is Lo Zhong means mind training."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's a wonderful book by his holiness called Transforming the Mind, Teachings on Generating Compassion."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And mindfulness has many, many branches, compassion, loving kindness, equanimity, patience, perseverance."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "All of those are, you could think of them as extensions or applications of mindfulness because they all require mindfulness in them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then if you're scientifically bent, there's one called Destructive Emotions."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How can we overcome them? A dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and this is narrated by Daniel Goleman."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "He's done a lot of wonderful, wonderful research on mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And there's a whole school of scientists and psychologists and neuroscientists and neurologists and quantum physicists who meet almost every year, I think, and they have a dialogue on the mind and emotions and reality and try to do some bridging work between different cultures and different understandings of who we are as human beings and how we can begin to eliminate suffering not only for ourselves but for other people through these practices."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then one more called Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think she got talked into this title."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This is a wonderful, wonderful book by Sharon Bagley."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And again, this is for somebody who's interested in sort of the scientific part of it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then I'll do one or two last books here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's one that was translated, or excuse me, His Holiness the Dalai Lama's translator, Tubtan Jinpa, translated many, many traditional Tibetan texts from all the different schools in this lovely tome called Mind Training, The Great Collection."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And if at some point you find you're really taken by the practices and you don't want to spend $20 or $30 for every single book that has been translated on these, you can buy one book that has all of them in it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it's a wonderful, wonderful resource again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And you get a flavor for all the different schools and all the different practices and ways of applying this."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I think I'll stop there."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "That's pretty, that's just more to go, but I want to make sure there's time for some questions and answers."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So I'll leave these out here, actually."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So Maureen, did you want to, if anybody has questions? Anything about the practice or the guided meditation or? Hi."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I was wondering, where do you start if you're interested in teaching mindfulness? If you're interested in teaching mindfulness? You mean like at a center? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This is something that you'd like to do is to teach mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Well, I think you could call up some of the different centers around and talk to the teachers and establish a relationship and see if you can teach there."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But do you need to go to school or get some kind of certification? Oh, okay."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So in terms of teaching mindfulness, I think that within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, because it's such a foundation of all the different practices, that at a certain point when people feel that they're ready to begin teaching it or somebody invites them to teach it, then you can go that route."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I know that there are many courses that you can take or you can study with different mamas."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You can study at a university."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But it's not like you get a certificate that says, you're now mindfully aware."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I certainly don't have one of those other moments where I'm really not mindful."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You just need to be allowed to teach."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think that when you feel like you're ready to teach, you should teach."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I think it's also to recognize that it's ongoing as they say practice, practice, practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "All the teachers that I know, we're all practicing even as we're teaching."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "That's why that was one of the reasons why I was interested in becoming a teacher, because I will probably, I will never end."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Practice unfolds, especially it changes over the years."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the more that you practice, it begins to have, it's like marriage."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, there's the day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then there's the lifetime of the experience."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so practice is kind of like you have an opportunity every day to practice, but the meditation experience also changes over time because we change over time and our situation changes over time as well."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Any question about outside noises? I'm having a difficult time concentrating and not being distracted."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And not just car noises, you know, but other noises around the room."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I really had a difficult time with that, like at my job, concentrating."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Focusing at work and not being distracted."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, and there was a situation when you did that guided meditation that I thought of."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Because I was distracted and I reacted."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It wasn't a good situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "That's great insight, though, to recognize that oftentimes when we're triggered, there's maybe multiple things going on."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the trigger is kind of like the little tipping point that says enough already."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So within the mindfulness meditation, one thing that you might try doing for a while in your practice is meditating on sound."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You can always meditate on the, you know, meditation on the body."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You can meditation on the breath."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You can also meditate on sound and being mindfully aware of the sound."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And notice when you start to overlay something on the sound, like, oh, that irritating train that just went by."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, I can't believe that flame."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "My gosh, how will they ever hear me, my voice over the microphone, because that flame roared overhead."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So notice what happens with the dialogue that gets overlaid on what's actually just a neutral event."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when you notice that, to just say, oh, irritation, come back to the sound."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And to, again, very lightly, you don't want to force your attention on your meditation object, whether it's the breath or the body or sound."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You want to just bring it back very, very gently."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to wrestle with our minds."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Our minds don't like to be wrestled with at all."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "They really get resistant."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we just want to kind of place it back where it needs to go."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So I practice on your cushion at home for a while."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then periodically at work to just, just to track."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, there goes that train again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And there's also this over here to just be aware of it and to be aware of when the irritation arises to begin to neutralize it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So instead of, oh, that blank, blank train, say, oh, just a little irritated and just relax back into the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The breath is such a wonderful, integrative, neutral place to come fully back into our body and to not only be present, but it softens everything a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And to just try that practice first on your cushion and then to try it in little, little five minutes here and there at work and then see what happens."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "That's a good question, especially about sound."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We often don't think about sound, but we're very sensitive to not only the ambient sound, but we always pay attention to tonality."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How is that other person talking to me? You know, or how are we talking to them? We always register it even though we don't really focus in on it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Anybody else? This kind of goes to the same issue."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You might have already answered it, but my question was about when are you, like when thinking of an incident or a type of incident, my inclination is to avoid or remove myself from it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it seems like that is resisting it instead of just noticing."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it's not a sound, but if it's someone who's driving crazy."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So then you have a safety issue, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Yeah, we're moving myself from even being around the thing that is irritating."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Yeah, that's good tracking."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Yeah, that's really important."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I think that's a good question to ask, partly because in meditation sometimes when we're really suffering with something, we want to turn it right off, you know, and a really good way to do that is to sort of disassociate from it, to remove ourselves from the reactivity of it or to just shut it on, you know, shut down our reactivity or remove ourselves from the thing that's reactive outside."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And again, we're taking ourselves out of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's a judgment in there."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's a mental judgment of, I don't like this, this is bad, this is wrong, they're wrong, whatever, that it is not staying fully present with what is actually just a situation and just an emotion arising."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We place overlays on top of these things."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So for example, tonight in the traffic going down 19th Avenue in the car, very irritated because they didn't change the timing of the lights."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How can I be mindfulness in this moment of irritation? Focus on the breath and recognizing there's just this fine line between, ooh, that I could really stay with irritation until the light changes really easily, very, very easily."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And we all have those moments of, ooh, I could really, really stay really quite in my positivity here, really irritated."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Or I could shift it a little bit and give myself a little breathing room."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I could let the irritation go for the length of a light."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I can always pick it up in the next light, very easily."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But maybe for this light, I'll give myself those five minutes that I haven't had all day to just breathe, just for five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then I can go and I can, oh, here's another opportunity to practice again."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Okay, really, really, really irritated."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Endless stories about irritation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Or I have another five minutes here at this light."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I could give myself five minutes to just not turn it off and not step out of my body or my irritation, but to say, I'd like to shift this and give myself a little bit of room here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I can always choose to go back and pick it up, or I can choose to be in this moment now."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Because the irritation is really, really just in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I'm just sitting in a car."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's just a light going on."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So there's these little windows that we can sometimes remember to see."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, there goes that window."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I want to grab that window and step into it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And the more that we practice, the more that we begin to see those spaces and then we can expand them more and more."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So then maybe the first test is this really irritating pattern of traffic lights."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then tomorrow it could be at the checkout stand with an interaction."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we begin to apply the practice in different situations."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So does that kind of answer your question? Okay, good."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Could you talk a little bit about working with slogans? Working with slogans."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Oh, let me pull up the book."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's a wonderful book called Advice from a Spiritual Friend."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And one of the things that is really interesting, when Buddhism came into Tibet, Tibet was an oral tradition culture considered the red faced barbarians of Asia."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "They're really terrified everybody because they were masters at not only living nomadic life in incredible conditions, but they were also masters of trade and guerrilla warfare."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There was little robber gangs that would travel everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "They had no education, no written language for hundreds and hundreds of years."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so when Buddhism came into Tibet, one of the Dharma kings at the time decided that in order to help teach people, one of the things they established is working with slogans or mnemonic devices."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, like we have them too in our culture, like a stitch in time saves nine."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, if you try to think of some other ones, I'm sure somebody has one on them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "A penny saved is a penny earned."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "To see a penny pick it up all the day, you'll have good luck."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So every culture has these little sayings and within those little sayings, there's always a little teaching."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "There's always a little message or a little story that if you take that little phrase, you can expand it further."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So within the Tibetan tradition, especially, they're very, very big on these little tiny slogans that often relate it culturally to where the nomads were."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think one of them is like, oh, never placed the load of an ox on the back of a zoo."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This is one of my favorites."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And a zoo, I think, is like either the female ox or the female yak, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Anyway, what it has to do is oxen are very, very, very strong, very, very sturdy animals, and they're known to carry a lot of weight, and you can put a lot on top of them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But you would never want to take that load and put it somewhere else where it would crush the other person or crush the other being."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So there's these little devices."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so, for example, if I'm, say, I'm a business person and I'm working with slogans, and my slogan of the day is don't take the load of an ox and put it on a zoo, and maybe I have this really high-powered person that I work with and they're out for the day, and I have a deadline to meet, and I want it done like that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But I'm going to choose the new secretary."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to crush the zoo right out the gate."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it's like, where do we place the appropriate load or the appropriate energy with the appropriate situation? So there's these little slogan devices you can work with on a daily basis, and say you pick one a day, and then you work with that all day, and that's your practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So that's a good question."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think we have time for maybe one or two more burning questions before we wrap up."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So would you recommend creating the guided meditation that you did, sort of a constructive reconnecting with an emotion that's previously happened, and seeing and looking at it? Would you recommend kind of rolling your own, if you will, when you come about a situation, it doesn't have to be a heated situation, but just a situation where you were lost in it, and you think back and to recreate in your mind when you're sitting to get the feeling of flavor of that."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So it seems like it's by exposure and examination and recognition for future."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think it's kind of walking."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The reason I wanted to do it is a guided meditation, partly to introduce you to that experience of, I'm really in it, and I can step out of it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I'm really in it, and I can step out of it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I can always come back to the breath."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The challenge with that is if you're just on your own, is you really have to be pretty mindfully aware to recognize that I'm really in it, and I'm going to choose now to come back to this moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Because one of the things is sometimes we can get really in it and really just sit in it for a while."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think it's a good place to practice to start on your cushion, or if you can practice throughout the day, start slowly with people and situations."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it's really good to practice with situations where there's not as much of a trigger."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "For example, practice with a neutral situation first, like maybe just waiting in the line at the grocery store and suddenly become aware of, oh, I could be mindfully breathing for a few minutes here, and then begin to expand to other situations."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think that if you're going to practice, say you have a challenging day at work or something with the family, there's always an opportunity to go back and sit on your cushion and to experience it, and then come back to the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then to ask yourself the question, in this present moment, what will I do next time? What is the choice I'll make to do differently? Otherwise, we could get caught up in looping again on the past."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And, well, I want to revisit that conversation with you because I didn't like what you said."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so it's like, well, let's go back to this present moment and maybe tomorrow, what will I do differently in the situation? So that would be a good place to start."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Well, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I want to thank the Meditation Center for inviting me down here and thank the traffic light gods for blessing my journey to arrive here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And again, if you're curious or want to write down any of these book titles or just want to flip through them, please feel free to come up."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I'll be around for a few minutes."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Let me explore how concentration, right concentration on the Eightfold Path, supports the development of wisdom, of understanding, not just any kind of wisdom, but the understanding about the nature of experience as impermanent, unreliable as a source of lasting happiness."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "That is not worth clinging to, because in that clinging we're assuming a kind of."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "When we cling to something, it's like we're assuming both that there's a permanence to it, at least of certain, you know, some kind of stability to the thing we're clinging to."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And we're also kind of assuming that it's going to be a reliable thing that will make us happy."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's something about the clinging, the view, the belief embedded in that clinging, is that holding onto this thing will make me feel more safe, more happy, more loved, more at ease in the world, and that that clinging, that belief, that view, is basically founded on a misperception, a misunderstanding of the nature of the experience we're clinging to, thinking that there is some permanent, reliable nature of it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so with the development of the Eightfold Path, the cultivation starting from the beginning of the Eightfold Path with this understanding of the nature of experience, we have to have some place, we start with an understanding, the wisdom in this path, the wisdom that's developed on the path, starts from a kind of an intellectual understanding."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We may hear something, maybe it resonates, maybe it doesn't really resonate, but maybe we're willing to engage with the practices that are said to be supportive for helping us move in the direction of more ease and peace in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so the Eightfold Path begins with a stepping into some of the teachings, some of the wisdom that the Buddha offers around this very thing, the nature of experiences, impermanent, unreliable, not worth clinging to the Buddha since."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's nothing worth clinging to because that clinging creates suffering, creates stress, creates struggle, unease, unhappiness, and actually lack of safety."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the wisdom relates to that growth of understanding around what starts as a kind of an intellectual understanding."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We hear information perhaps from Dharma talks, from friends, from friends on the path, from teachers, and then we begin to work with the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "In the practice of the Eightfold Path we begin to employ the method the Buddha encourages us, wise understanding, wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, all supporting wise concentration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And that cultivation of those factors of the path creates conditions, that concentration that arrives, because concentration is not something we do, it arises when the conditions are there."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the first seven factors of the Eightfold Path really create the conditions for the arising of that concentration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And the arising of all of those together, those first seven factors plus the concentration, creates the conditions for the arising of the direct understanding, the direct knowledge, the direct witnessing of the impermanent, unreliable nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And when there's that direct witnessing, our minds begin to get it, that it's not worth clinging to."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so our minds begin to slowly work their way to letting go of that clinging and craving."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I had this image of the Eightfold Path, maybe it came up last night or this morning, I don't remember exactly when, but it came up as I was thinking about talking about this this morning."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And the image that came to me is that each path factor, each of those eight practices, are kind of like a strand of a rope."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And they weave together those eight strands of the path."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not so much like, there is a kind of a sense that there is a kind of a conditioned, wise understanding supports wise intention."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "When we understand, have taken in something about the nature of experience as impermanent, unreliable, and have heard that it's useful to explore experience from the perspective of mindfulness and being curious about experience in the moment, that understanding will lead to, hopefully, begins to lead to the intention to engage."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so there is a kind of a stair step kind of fashion in which these factors support each other, wise understanding supports wise intention, which supports the intention to engage in harmony with our fellow human beings, with ethical conduct, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And all of those together, they support the arising of effort towards non-suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So all of them kind of do support each other one after the other, but they also weave together."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not like we practice one and then put it down and then the next one comes in."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "They're all kind of being massaged at the same time."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so this idea, this notion of these eight threads of a rope, in a rope the threads kind of get woven around each other and they support each other."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "They twist together and the strength of that twisting together supports each other and it becomes stronger than any one of the threads individually."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so with that kind of interweaving of those threads of the Eightfold Path, that creates the conditions for the arising of understanding, direct understanding, the experience of understanding, impermanent, unreliable, not self-nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then as we understand that, as there is a direct experience, that kind of confirmation, it can feel startling."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This experience of wisdom, when wisdom arises in that moment, it's not something we do."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Wisdom arises in dependence on the conditions that have been created by those eight path factors coming together."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So we don't do it, but there's the way in which the conditions of our practice of the Eightfold Path supports the arising of that direct understanding, that insight."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It often feels like a little bit of a shift in the mind, a little bit of an aha, a little bit of oh, yeah, I see."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I see something I didn't see before."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So there can be in our practice the experience of wisdom, the experience of insight."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "With that experience, it's like it gives us a boost of confidence, because it's like, oh, now I get it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Now I see what they've been talking about."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so there's confidence and there's also energy that's brought to our practice."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not like we usually, in those first moments of like, oh, wow, I see something."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We don't feel like, oh, I figured it all out."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's just a little bit of a hint."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just a little taste, a little sense of, oh, there's more here to see."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's more here to understand."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so there's a kind of a deepening of the confidence and the value of doing what we've been doing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so we continue to engage."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then it's like we weave in more of those strands of the Eightfold Path with the ones that have been there."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the continued engagement is like every time we're engaging with the path of practice, we're weaving in more of those strands and strengthening the fibers to be able to understand and see the truth, the nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "That's impermanent, unreliable, not self."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "As I said, the experience of the arising of wisdom is a gift."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not something we make happen, but we support the conditions for it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The conditions of cultivating the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And recognizing the experience of wisdom, recognizing when that's happening, is another supportive condition for the development of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So wisdom is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Much as concentration is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Love is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Equanimity is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Concentration is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Patience is a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Right now I'm listing wholesome mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There are also some unwholesome mental formations, anger, confusion, hatred, greed."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "These functions of the mind that have an activity that kind of propel us towards the next thing that we do."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Mental formations, one of the functions of mental formation is to propel us onward."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the wholesome and the unwholesome mental formations, the practice essentially encourages and supports the cultivation of the wholesome mental formations, which lead us to more to understanding that greed, aversion, and delusion contribute to our struggles, our suffering, and to help us see the impermanent, unreliable, not self-nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Greed, aversion, and delusion are founded on the belief that there is something permanent, reliable to engage with, something self."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so these two, the habits that get us caught and the misunderstanding about these truths are intimately connected."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So when we bring attention to these wholesome qualities of mind, when we become aware of, bring that quality of wise mindfulness to, patience, or love, or concentration, when we are aware that they're happening while they're happening, that tends to strengthen those qualities in that it creates the conditions for them to arise more frequently in the future."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Because our system really understands or kind of resonates with those wholesome qualities, as wholesome, as onward leading, as very different from the way that we tend to get caught by things."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So our heart, our minds directly experience the value of those wholesome qualities, which tends to create the conditions for them to arise more in the future."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so wisdom, being one of those wholesome qualities, we can also become aware of the experience of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sayada Utejenia, when I was on retreat with him at one point, asked me to be aware of the, what his phrase was, be aware of wisdom at work, be aware of when wisdom is working in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "He often talked about our mental formations as things that have jobs, that greed has its job of holding onto things."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Aversion has its job of pushing things away."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Love has its job of connecting us."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Wisdom has its job of helping the mind to understand that greed, aversion, and delusion are not helpful."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Wisdom has the job of helping us to see impermanent, unreliable, not self-natured experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so Sayada asked me to, you know, notice when wisdom is working."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And this was like, it was not, I didn't understand how to do that actually."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I didn't quite understand what he meant."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "But I could kind of sort of see that there were times when I was suffering less, and times where I was suffering more."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so I kind of began exploring experience from, well, when I'm suffering less, I'm just going to say to myself, well, wisdom must be working here."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I don't quite know how it's working, but wisdom must be working here."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Because I know that, so this was, this is kind of using the intellectual understanding, right? Because I knew that wisdom had the capacity to help the mind be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So I began the exploration of just noticing when there was a little bit less suffering, sometimes when a lot less suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And when I was caught, I would, I would know, you know, that no, wisdom is not working right now."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the, the, that exploration over time led me to be able to articulate some of the ways that we know wisdom is working."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So this, the exercises I described it to you, you know, Sayaro Utegenia did not give me this Dharma talk."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "He just told me, yeah, go off and notice wisdom at work."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And I kind of found my way to this."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "But I have found it helpful to kind of to point to this for people because wisdom is working so much of the time in our practice and, and kind of highlighting that it, that there is wisdom working and recognizing, oh yeah, there is wisdom there."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It strengthens, it's a condition that supports wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so right now I just want to name a few examples of ways that you might notice wisdom at work."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "These are just a few, not exhaustive list here, but some of the ones that maybe happen maybe more frequently in a way so that the ones that many of you have probably already experienced but maybe not quite recognized, oh yeah, that's wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sometimes when we experience the arising of wisdom, what we're more focused on is the, the lessening of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "You know, there's a sense of, oh, what a relief."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so we're kind of more focused on the sense that the suffering has diminished as opposed to knowing wisdom did that."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So it's, it's, it's just a little bit of a kind of turning towards the appreciation that wisdom, wisdom is the factor of the mind that allows the release from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "That, that, just that understanding helps perhaps mitigate our, our view or idea that I did that, you know, that I made that happen somehow."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So a few of the ways we might experience wisdom at work."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I think one of the most important, one of the most familiar ways or maybe a kind of a more common way, a more available way to notice that wisdom is working is when we might feel a shift of perspective around something difficult."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So we're, we're observing something challenging and we feel kind of struggle caught by it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then suddenly there's a kind of where we continue to kind of hang out with it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We have the sense of, okay, just keep being with it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then maybe there's a little bit of a shift."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The feeling of being caught by it goes away and it's not that the thing goes away, but there's a sense of it's okay."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is just something happening."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is just frustration arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is just a feeling of confusion happening."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So it's, it's a shift in the mind from kind of the view or the belief, you know, what wisdom has done there perhaps is to release the belief that this arising needs to be, something needs to be done with it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So when, for instance, when frustration arises, wisdom understands it just like, oh, this is frustration arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just frustration happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The confusion around frustration might be, this frustration is arising and I need to do something in order to fix the problem that's frustrating me."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that's the perspective of greed and aversion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I need to do something with this."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The perspective of wisdom says it's just an arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And when that perspective is there, often there's a little bit of a shift, a feeling of a softening, a feeling of a more space."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's a kind of an experiential, almost physical at times quality of more space, more ease perhaps, a little bit of a release."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Even if the frustration doesn't go away or the situation doesn't go away, we understand, oh, this is just frustration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So it's like the impulse to do with that frustration has weakened or fallen away."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So there's that kind of a shift, a shift of experience about something challenging."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Kind of like, you know, sometimes I use an analogy of a car with difficult emotions, difficult experiences."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "When we're driving a car and we have our foot full on the gas pedal, you know, the car keeps going and the momentum of our minds with that belief, I need to do something so when the frustrations are rising and I need to fix and need to change, it's like we have our foot on the gas pedal of that frustration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "All the thoughts that are in there, the foot is on the gas pedal of that frustration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This shift that I'm talking about is kind of like taking the foot off the gas pedal and putting the car into neutral."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The moment, when we do that in a car, you know, the momentum of the car doesn't stop."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The car keeps going, but there's no longer the propelling forward with it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so this kind of a shift of, oh, this is just what's happening in the present moment, may have that kind of quality."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's like our minds have been put into a kind of a neutral space where perhaps there's a spinning of the gears of some mental formation like frustration, but they're just spinning."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "They're no longer, they're no longer locked together."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And with the car analogy, if you put a car into neutral, that momentum will slow down over time."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "If you leave it in neutral and don't keep re-engaging the gears."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that kind of momentum of seeing, oh, this is just, sometimes we can then begin to see the momentum of that habit or pattern begin to wind down a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So again, that's in the space of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Wisdom is able to help the mind hold that experience in that neutrality, in that space of, oh, this is just, that this is just kind of understanding the wisdom there is often related to seeing experience as experience in the present moment, the shift from the idea that this needs to be acted on to, it's just experience arising in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Another flavor of wisdom is, as we begin to, and this I think really begins, so all of this kind of wisdom arising is supported by the cultivation of all of the Eightfold Path, but also the concentrated mind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The mind, not concentrated and focused, but just stable."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We talked last time and the time before about the stability of mind that comes with focusing on one experience and the stability of mind that comes with being stable in awareness with experience changing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The ability to see wisdom at work needs some stability of mind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily have to be a long time of stability of mind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Like it doesn't necessarily have to be hours and hours of stability of mind before an insight arises."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I've seen very early in my practice, in fact, you know, just the kind of the deep understanding that can arise as mindfulness comes up in a moment, in a split second."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sometimes I call these, we could call it a burst of concentration."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's a little burst of continuity of mindfulness that happens in a split second."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so sometimes what I mean by a burst of continuity is that sometimes when mindfulness arises, you get very, very continuous mindfulness for like three seconds."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And in that three seconds, there can be a deep seeing into what's happening in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So those bursts of continuity become more frequent."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The more we cultivate the path of practice, the more we cultivate mindfulness and concentration, it's almost like just that practice of cultivating mindfulness and concentration strengthens the mindfulness that arises to be a little bit more continuous when it arises."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And we can be more aware of it when it arises."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So again, recognizing the mindfulness arising, recognizing the concentration, this supports and cultivates those wholesome qualities as well."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So those little bursts of concentration sometimes can reveal kind of the conditioned nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "How one thing leads to another leads to another leads to another."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I really feel like it's connected to the seeing into the not-self nature of experience because so often we assume that the reason something is unfolding, the reason why something happens is because I made it happen."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I decided to think this or I decided to do this thing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So sometimes we can see just in a moment, it may be in one of those little bursts of mindfulness, we might see a thought arising and then see how that thought conditions the mind to kind of want to go somewhere, conditions the mind to kind of want to move in the direction of a particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So I've told this story a lot."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The story of seeing a thought arise that."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Actually, while I was cutting an apple, I saw a thought arise about an ex-partner being at a fruit stand."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so I could see, and what I'm describing here took place in a matter of a couple seconds."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So I was cutting the apple, I saw the thought, and I saw that the mind wanted to kind of jump on that thought and think more thoughts to become angry with that person, wanting revenge of some kind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that seeing happened in a split second and the very seeing of the impulse towards wanting to get angry."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The wisdom that arose in that moment was, yeah, that way lies suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that for me was an insight into essentially dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "That direction will lead to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then witnessing that the mind just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It let go of that direction."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so in that little burst of continuity, there was a lot of seeing, just like seeing the conditioned nature."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There was like, I wasn't doing two parts of it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I wasn't doing the pattern of the habit unfolding around the thought, the intention towards getting angry."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And I also noticed that I wasn't doing this awareness, that that was a gift that was unfolding, the seeing of it, and then the release from the movement towards the anchor."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I didn't make that happen."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Again, I saw that that just happened."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So a lot of insight not only into dukkha there, but into not self."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So seeing the conditioned nature of experience arising, sometimes we see how a thought will lead to a kind of an intention and to an emotion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And that begins to undermine the belief in that I'm doing it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Because we can see so clearly, it's just happening."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's like dominoes falling."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that, again, is the experience of wisdom, wisdom seeing the conditioned nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sometimes another kind of wisdom might be, sometimes when the mindfulness and concentration together are very penetrating."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "When the wisdom is strong, sometimes as soon as we see, as soon as we actually recognize, oh, yeah, that's anger arising in the present moment, or that's frustration arising in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "A few minutes ago, I talked about seeing that and feeling a shift of perspective."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Oh, it's just that arising, but seeing that the momentum of it continues."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There is wisdom there, but it's a wisdom that is kind of at the beginning."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Over time, sometimes wisdom can be stronger, and it might as soon as it sees, as soon as the awareness kind of notices, oh, that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just like it goes poof."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It just vanishes right in the moment of being seen."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sometimes this can be the strength of concentration, but sometimes it's the strength of wisdom that allows the mind to just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "In that moment, the wisdom may be, there's two different kinds of wisdom that might be happening here, or more probably, two that I can think of in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "One, it might be that the mindfulness and the concentration are so strong that they're really attuned to the impermanent nature of experience, and seeing that it's just an arising and it's ceasing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So we might be attuning to the impermanent nature of experience in seeing it vanish like that."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Or it might be that the mind, kind of like I described a minute ago, the mind really connects to, wow, that's arising and it's suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's suffering to have that in the mind, and the mind, the wisdom in that moment understanding how to let it go and doing that letting go in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "We can't do that letting go again."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's the strength of wisdom that allows the release from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And it's a gift, it's a gift, but there are the conditions that allow us to support the cultivation of that seeing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So sometimes, as soon as a reactive habit or pattern, as soon as suffering is seen, it will vanish."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The first time I consciously noticed this, I didn't trust it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I didn't actually believe."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I thought I didn't know how to witness or observe emotions."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And I went to my teacher and that's what I said."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This was on a three-month retreat and I said, I don't know how to observe emotions."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And thank goodness she didn't just launch into a Dharma talk in that interview about, well, I'll tell you how to observe emotions."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "She said, well, what did you experience? And I said, I noticed that I was experiencing a kind of a feeling of loneliness and when I turned to look at it, I couldn't see it anymore."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And she said, trust your experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And I thought it was some flaw in my capacity to be mindful that I didn't know how to, but it was almost like it just went away and it's like, I don't feel that loneliness anymore."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And she asked me some questions and she said, trust your experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that's an example of how we can misunderstand."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And I thought it was delusion that I couldn't see something."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So those are just a few ways."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So I'll just rename them kind of the feeling a shift of perspective around something challenging, noticing something, experience as experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is just this arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Seeing the conditioned nature of experience, kind of seeing one thing lead to another lead to another, the witnessing of that, kind of the not me doing it, and then this kind of quick disappearance of a reactivity when it is met with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "These are all ways that wisdom is at work."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So recognizing these moments, these moments of freedom, really, there's a freedom that happens in those moments, whether a kind of a large freedom or a kind of a more, just a shift of a perspective and there's a little more ease, there's a way in which we can appreciate the release from the suffering there and understand that it's wisdom that's supporting that."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The experience when we can recognize these small moments, there's essentially little gifts of, if not non-greed, non-aversion and non-delusion, much reduced greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And the experience of the release, the freedom from greed, aversion and delusion, that is experienced as very, very freeing."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The mind really understands the absence of greed, aversion and delusion there as being a different way to live in this world."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And those moments, they're kind of a pointer for us."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And they give us a taste, they give us a little taste of what it might be like for the mind to let go of greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So they're little pointers."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Actually, the definition of freedom, one of the most easily accessible definitions of freedom, of enlightenment, is the absence of greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not the presence of anything."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's the absence of those reactive habits and patterns of mind."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so the taste of the reduction of greed, aversion and delusion, the taste in moments of a mind that has let go of greed, aversion and delusion, these are pointers in the direction of freedom, freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The conditions, until wisdom is so strong that it is kind of continuously, when wisdom gets really strong, the momentum of wisdom, greed, aversion and delusion won't be arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "But the momentum of wisdom is, again, wisdom as a mental formation, it comes and goes."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It gets stronger and stronger through the life of our practice, but wisdom comes and goes."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so wisdom will fall away and will be caught in our delusions and confusions again."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is not a problem, it's just the nature of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just the nature of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "But something about the shift of mind that happens when we have experienced, there's something about, when we've experienced some of that taste of freedom, unless we're second guessing ourselves, which I did plenty of following some of those understandings, when I caught my delusion again, my mind would kind of like, well, I must not have seen that."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It must have been imagination or something, because that's the way delusion works."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Delusion obscures things, it doesn't really connect."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's like wisdom and delusion, like delusion does not get wisdom at all, it just doesn't get it."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so when delusion is arising, there can be a little bit of the understanding of, when as wisdom strengthens over time, there is the understanding of yes, that capacity to see through greater version and delusion, to understand impermanent, unreliable, not so."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "That capacity is there, but it's just not happening right now."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just not happening right now."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And yet the confidence that can come from those moments, can reinvigorate our engagement, our energy to apply the practice, weaving those strands of the Eightfold Path together, supporting more capacity for understanding."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "My name is Maria Stratman."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm really happy to be here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This evening, I want to talk to you about the general topic of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But recently, I've been inspired by a poem by Amanda Gorman."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "You may remember her as the poet laureate for who read her poem, The Hill We Climb, at the inauguration of the brilliant yellowed coat that she wore, and the verve that she delivered that poem with."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Well, she's written a book recently, and it's called Call Us What We Carry, and in that is this poem."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And one of the things that intrigues me is I'm just not sure why she chose the title she did."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So tonight's topic, in response to the poem, considers the intersection of impermanence, intentions, and seeing clearly what is true now, and how can we be in the presence of what is true now, in the presence in this time of uncertainty? How do we meet uncertainty, and what does it mean to meet uncertainty in the next place? I've called my talk The Heroism of Being Changed."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So if I forget that as I ramble on, please remind me."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Wave your hand and say, wait a minute, what were we going to talk about heroism and being changed? So let me start with the poem."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The poem is called Closure."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "To begin again, isn't to go backwards, but to decide to go."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "To begin again, isn't to go backwards, but to decide to go."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Our story is not a circle carved, but a spiral shed shaped spinning, shifting inward and outward ad infinitum, like a lung on the bank of speech."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We disembark both beside and beyond who we were, who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It is a return and a departure."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We spiral on, pushing up and out, like a growing thing, making its form out of earth."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "In a poem, there's no end."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Just a place where the page glows wide and waiting, like a lifted hand, poised and paused."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Here is our bond, unbordered by bone."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Perhaps love is how it feels to breathe the same air."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "All we have is time, is now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How we are moved says everything about what we are to each other, and what are we to each other, if not everything."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "To begin again, isn't to go backwards, but to decide to go."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's the same as the meditation instruction, when we find that our mind is wandered away, we say just come back to the breath and begin breathing again."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We don't spend a lot of time worrying about how we got there or what was the definition of the thoughts and what direction where they were going."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We just come back and we just start breathing again."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We just come back to the breath."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's the same instruction."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's the same instruction for everything."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We just come back and we take the next step."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This poem invites us to show up in this moment, show up in this moment, in these days, in this month, in this year, to show up with these conditions, just as we are, not as the person we used to be, not as the person we would like to be, not as our ideal selves, but as this person, this person that is weary or excited, this person, these conditions, this room, show up this way and then take a step."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Don't worry about how you got here or where you're going to go when you leave here, but who is this person right here? Our practice is to be aware, to be aware of our state of mind, to be aware of this condition, this experience, this place."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We do that in meditation and we do that in our lives, this, this place."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to notice, I'm not the person I was yesterday."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm not the person I was just a few minutes ago."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm this person to recognize not so much how we've changed, but that this is the person showing up for these conditions."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is the person who has to decide whether to sit here, whether to leave, whether to breathe, whether to not breathe."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Well, that's usually not so voluntary."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So we want to apply this mindfulness of just how things are, not only in the meditation, but when we get up from meditating and when we take the next step and to see that what life is, what experience is, is not so much our changing what we're going to do next, but that we carry this forward into the next moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That what we decide in this moment, what we do in this moment, what our intentions are in this moment, condition the next moment, condition tomorrow, condition what happens next."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We come here with our intentions."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Some of those intentions are large intentions, some of them are small intentions, some of them act like motivators, and some of them get in our way."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Being aware of what our intentions are, occasionally asking ourselves, what are my intentions here? What is it that I'm doing? Why am I doing this? What is it that's showing up here in this moment? And keeping in mind how it is that we want to be in the moment, not who we want to be, who we want to be."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This mythical self is not the person who is here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "You know, I've always had as the overriding intention in my life to be open-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is this is how I want to be."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I realized that that begins with be open-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It doesn't say anything about becoming open-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And that the beginning of that is be open."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh, I always thought of being open-hearted as what the generosity that I was going to bestow on others."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But the first thing I have to do is be open."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That was an interesting realization that the way that I am in this world with you in this moment is what I'm working with."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's wise if I know what that is and how that fits the intentions that I have, the large intentions and the small intentions, the everyday intentions."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The practice is to show up with our intentions and what those mean, our intentions of kindness, of wholesomeness, of skillfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to see, is it here now? Am I ready? Am I ready for just this? Oh, I'm not ready."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Okay, I know I'm not ready."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is what I'm working with."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "These are the skills I have."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What I cultivate come out of my intentions and what arises out of my actions now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That condition is the next moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That's the next set of conditions I have to worry about."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So right now, having just sat for 45 minutes, I'm feeling fairly relaxed, pretty easy."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Public speaking doesn't frighten me, so that's okay."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so I have a certain amount of ease with that, right? Okay."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I've been kind of relaxed."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "All right, that's the condition I'm bringing into this."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But earlier today, that was not necessarily true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I was out walking this afternoon."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And there was a couple, I walk around this pond in my neighborhood."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's about a quarter mile around the pond to give you an idea of the size of it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's not very large, has lots of koi in it, and a couple of ducks, sometimes geese, sometimes an egret feeding on the fish."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And this afternoon, a couple had their dog, and they were throwing balls out in the middle of the pond so that the dog could run in and chase the balls."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Now, this is a protected pond, and nobody's supposed to wade in it or get in it, and not disturb the fish or the ducks."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so I'm watching this, and I'm thinking, I should go up and tell that person, this is not acceptable."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They shouldn't be letting their dog in, much less encouraging their dog."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I'm feeling all of this ill will and agitation building up in me, and I'm walking, walking, walking."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I realized that there was outrage and a sense of injustice that was getting really strong."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I thought, well, now how can I approach this person? And the thoughts went to what's right speech, which why speech here? And then I said, well, first I better check in and see who is this that's trying to decide this why speech."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I decided part of what was happening was that there was this overwhelming feeling that I've been carrying around with me for days around the war in Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And that the feeling of the injustice of invasion and all of the experiences of frustration and helplessness that I've been having had built up in me."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I was about to take it out on this guy throwing his the ball into the water in this pond."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Recognizing that that was there that that was a condition of how I've been walking around my anxiety and sense of helplessness about war was really useful to see."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So I checked and you know, the fish had all moved away from that end of the pond."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The dog wasn't really aggressive."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So maybe the appropriate thing for me was not to think of the best thing to do, but to be aware of this container I have that includes my distress over the war in Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And maybe time better spent thinking about what does that mean for me? How am I reacting to that? What is what is that condition leading me to as opposed to worrying about why speech? Definitely noticing the agitation, the distress, the lack of satisfaction."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How do I meet that? Taking all that frustration and releasing it in the direction of somebody else innocent or not innocent just might not be the answer."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "At other times, I noticed the other day I noticed I woke up after dreams."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if you dream I tend to dream when I'm under stress or whether or when something is really moving in me."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I was having all the classic anxiety things in my dreams."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How can I get to Japan? Who knows why I wanted to go to Japan, but I needed to get there."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And how was I going to do that? Or I start, oh, my cars, I have a flat on my tire, or I have to get under and adjust something, you know, those kinds of dreams."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Dreams about helplessness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And as I got out of bed, I was aware of that."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I thought about Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so I said, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And then I noticed that the feeling that I had was this closed in feeling and very tight."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I actually had a feeling of smallness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if you've, it's hard to talk about an attitude of mind like this, but has to do with a sense of space."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I realized that was compressing all of these things."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And that what was needed was space."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I went outside and allowed all those feelings that I was, that just seemed like too much to just be true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Where there was more space for them."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Not chasing them away, just giving them a little more space."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And in that space, it was easy to see, easier to see."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How can I affect something positive? But when it was all compressed, it wasn't possible for me."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So being aware of the attitude that my mind, the mind state tells me something about this person in these conditions, who's trying to live life, doesn't tell me what to do."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But it gives me information so that I see clearly."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I see the campaigner person who wants to do something."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And rather than finding the place where I have to fix something or I have to take out the frustration, there needs to be space to see, ah, this is the person that's showing up now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is what it feels like to be the person who is feeling frustration and helplessness, sadness, and not start listing all the reasons that's true and all the, all the, all the dictators in the world or whatever feeds into the story."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But noticing this, oh, this is, this is the effect."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is, this is the agitation that is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And knowing the agitation that is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It is, it's the energy of just allowing what is true to be true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if any of you heard Gil's talk from this morning, but he actually, he's talking about the Satipatana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And this morning he talked about attitude of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And now that was really his talk at the, the mind state and, and the, the learning what the mind state is, how it feels is a practice."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "You know, when I talk about the space seems small, sometimes that must feel strange to you."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's only the way that I talk about it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The mind state is not a thing like a brain."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's, it's more, I like to think of it as the container in which my experience is taking place."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This, this is, this is the condition."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Part of the condition is the energy that I bring into the moment, whether that energy is low energy or high energy, whether I'm feeling compressed or spacious."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "When things seem confused, okay, things seem confused."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh, I don't like confusion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I have to do something about confusion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Why am I confused? Let me get it all organized."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm going to plan something."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Notice the tendency of the mind to want to plan in the state of confusion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What would it be like if I didn't do that? What if I didn't plan? What if I didn't do that activity? What would that, what would be true? What would arise? Am I okay with not knowing what's going to happen next? What does that feel like? We cultivate this kind of mindfulness in meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we think of it as mindfulness and stillness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Is there any way to get out that stillness when everything is chaotic, when everything feels out of control? How do we get, how do we realize that? When we come to the space where we say, oh, I see, there's just a moment of, ah, that."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And it's a moment, if we notice of ease, there's just a kind of feeling into it that's, oh, that's here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And just that moment of ease should be registered."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Rather like when we come back from being lost in thoughts on meditation, we say, I'm back."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And that I am here sometimes puts a little ease in the chaos of what's going on."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And when we recognize it, then it becomes something we know."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And it becomes a way of shifting our awareness from whatever it is that we've encountered that we may want to analyze, fix, change, and say, oh, this is what it feels like to be confused."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And just that much shift in awareness brings us to a place where we're not rolling around in whatever that the emotion is that we might have recognized."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How do we not get caught by the state of mind, but catch it? So that if we wake up sad, or confused, or angry, we can say, ah, sadness is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Hmm, I should be careful about that."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't have to then list all the reasons I've ever been angry."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Or list the reasons I've been angry with this person."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I can develop a relationship to uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know for sure what's going to happen in the next moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know what's going to happen in the next moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "When we have space for things to be just as they are, we have a freedom to not have to control what happens next."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So we aren't caught by whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We can say, oh, that is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We're afflicted by uncertainty at every turn we have."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "You know, I could go down the long list."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Over 6 million people have died in the world from COVID."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Many of us have decision fatigue."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Is this safe? Is this not safe? There are over 1."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "7 million refugees from the Ukraine in the last 12 days."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Where are all those people? There's inflation and financial insecurity."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "There are no end to things that we might worry about."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we as humans try to protect ourselves against these things."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we become more vigilant and more vigilant."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And pretty soon we are little vigilant machines."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we're so busy being vigilant, we haven't noticed that our hearts have turned down, that we have locked ourselves up, that we're constantly looking with an eye of suspicion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so something we were counting on comes up and somebody says, well, I'm not going to be able to make it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And all of a sudden, because we're carrying this suspicion around with us, oh, what's this about? Why are you doing this to me? And all of a sudden there's this adversary relationship."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What is quite possible? The other person just something came up and there's nothing they could do about it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Ajahn Chah said, looking for certainty in that which is not certain, you're bound to suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Looking for certainty in that which is not certain, you're bound to suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How do we free ourselves of that? How do we find a place of safety without spending all our lives trying to be safe and not letting anything happen and trying to control the outcome of what happens? We look to what our experience has taught us."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we'd say that with the idea that it's always going to be the same, but it turns out that it's not."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The conditions are never the same."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They're always changed in some way, just as we're changed in some way."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So no end of planning, no amount of planning is going to ensure that everything's going to happen just the way we want it to."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Better to say, oh, this is what it's like to be disappointed."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh, this is what it's like to be disappointed."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Whatever that experience is like, we can look at that experience and not, oh, this is your fault."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We don't have to have blame for all the bad things that happen in life."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We can say, oh, a bad thing has happened."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Now what's the next step? What do I do now? How do I approach this now? Where is my intention now? One of the ways we do that is by taking advantage of the space between what arises and naming it our own."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "One of the best instructions somebody ever gave me was to realize that I could name something that was going on and not make it mine or me."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Anger is present, but I'm not angry."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "If anger is here, something needs to be done."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't have to make it mine and have it be, oh, this is an angry person."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I can notice, okay, the energy is up in my body."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Okay, I can't do anything about that adrenaline, but knowing that the data adrenaline is rushing gives me a moment in which I can remember my intention toward kindness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I'll say, yeah, but I don't feel kind."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Okay, not feeling kind is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't like the way that feels."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we're not held by it anymore."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Once we see it, we can disentangle ourselves from it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We don't have to push it away."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I have a little problem with the instructions to just let it go because it feels too much like putting it away."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But if I can say, okay, it's here, and my intention for kindness is here, and they are struggling with one another."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm not in here fighting it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm saying, okay, okay, okay, I see both you guys are here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "When you're in that space of seeing of discerning the difference between what has arisen and who I am, then we have more freedom to choose the wise next step."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Sometimes when the adrenaline is running through our bodies, the best thing to do is to turn around and wash our hands."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Do something that takes care of that energy without responding, without jumping into what's the wise thing to do here, but rather take advantage of the fact that I notice this is happening."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Noticing feelings becomes a habit of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Noticing mind state becomes a habit of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And it begins to show up when you're not looking for it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And you start realizing, oh, this is what, oh, this is happening now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And not, oh, this is my habit and this is always happening."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Whenever I hear stories about refugees, what comes to mind is a hangover from when I was in grade school."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It was the time of the Hungarian Revolution, which gives you a clue of how long ago it was."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And two little girls showed up at my school."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They did not speak my language."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They were extremely exotic."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "My God, they had their ears pierced, unheard of in 1955, 57, 58, 58 probably, in Billings, Montana, unheard of."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "These were the most exotic people I'd ever seen."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I was so eager to get to know them and find out about them."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I couldn't speak to them."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I remember that look of terror."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And the two girls, they were sisters, would huddle together."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They'd kind of hide from everybody."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And they'd look around with suspicion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And every time I hear about refugees of any kind, I remember those two."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I have no idea what happened to them."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They were only there a brief time."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And they are a condition of my life."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They are a condition that this person who's arrived in this place is always affected by refugees, any refugee, anybody who's put out unexpectedly, unknowingly."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know what it would be like to feel like that."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But the experience for me is a very open experience."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It doesn't leave me with fear and dread."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It leaves me more with the feeling of compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh my God, what can I do about this? And to recognize that in the midst of the uncertainty and despair is to realize there's this unpleasant thing."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And there is this pleasant thing."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And both are conditions that the very distress we feel about injustice, inequality, those feelings of this is not right."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This should not be this way."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "They are also in the same room with the feelings of how can I make this better? What can I do about this? And the intentions that we have toward kindness and compassion and wholeness show up in that moment if we allow them if we allow ourselves to see them and not be dragged away by whatever it is that that comes up."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But rather, they're, oh, this is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And what else is here? Words matter."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What we name things matters."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Uncertainty is just impermanence fully realized."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "To not be uncertain, not be certain about who we are, what is true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But to every moment, see it freshly."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What's true now? What's true now is to look at change and realize that all the conditions that we've been through have changed us and continue to change us."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The new conditions change us."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to be willing to see I'm changed by this."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm changed by this experience."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm changed by this knowledge."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm changed by recognizing who's shown up in this moment in this body."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to embrace that change in the sense of just allowing it to be true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What arises in the moments when the unexpected arises? What happens? I recently took a week when I realized I was really busy trying to make everything happen."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And said, what happens if I don't do all this responsible stuff? And I decided to work a crossword puzzle."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And for four days, that's all I did."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I worked that crossword, not a crossword puzzle."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I mean, a thousand-piece puzzle, a regular puzzle."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm a crossword puzzle fanatic, so that came up."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But what I did was work this puzzle just to see what happens if I don't do all these things."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "What happens? What arises? What do I think? What do I think this person? Who is this person here? What is useful is to realize is that almost anything could happen."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to know that we don't have to know the outcome."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We don't, things don't have to be the way they are, how we think they should be."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We can't go back to a non-existent past."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We can only access this moment, this person who is here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We do so with the accumulated wisdom and humility of all the things that we have thought and been in the past, who are not who we are now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "As Amanda's poem said, we are both beside and beyond who we were, who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We are the heroes of our every day."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We take the next step into the uncertain with the confidence of seeing clearly and the wisdom of our own intentions."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So those are my thoughts for tonight."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Do you have any questions? Observations? I'd be happy to hear."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Let me read the poem to you again."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "To begin again isn't to go backwards, but to decide to go."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Our story is not a circle carved, but a spiral shed, shaped, spinning, shifting inward and outward odd infinitum like a lung on the bank of speech."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We disembark both beside and beyond who we were, who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It is a return and a departure."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We spiral on, pushing up and out like a growing thing, making its form out of earth."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "In a poem, there is no end."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Just a place where the page grows wide and waiting like a lifted hand, poised and paused."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Here is our bond, unbordered by bone."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Perhaps love is how it feels to breathe the same air."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "All we have is time, is now."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How we are moved says everything about what we are to each other and what are we to each other, if not everything."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "May you know the peace of uncertainty, the possibilities of uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "May your practice lead you to a place where you can see clearly, so that wisdom is with you always."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "One definition of meditation could be that the mind and the body are together, the same place at the same time."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so just arriving in your body in a simple way, perhaps, in one place in the Buddha's main instructions for mindfulness, I said we could just be aware there is a body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And from there we might kind of arrive a little more close in to the physicality, the sensations in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Perhaps aware of the uprightness of the body, the contact points."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And maybe being curious about whether there's relaxation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "The relaxation of body really helps our mind to be able to land in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So you might just check in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "You can scan briefly through the body and see if there can be some relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe checking into the head and face, relaxing the head and face."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing the neck, the shoulders, the arms, the hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing the chest and upper back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe taking a deeper breath and noticing how that supports relaxing that area of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing across the stomach, the abdomen, middle and lower back, the hips, the legs and feet."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And having done this kind of brief scan of the muscles of the body, I often find it really supportive to check in and see how the inside of the body is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And maybe there can be some relaxation inside the throat."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the heart can relax the stomach, the intestines, maybe they can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And having relaxed the body to some extent, maybe the mind too can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Mental tension is often expressed with worries, concerns, thoughts about the past or the future, ruminations about now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And seeing if that, any mental tension, if there can be a softening there, setting it aside for the time being, for this period of this time together."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "When the body and mind relax, kind of naturally, our system becomes attuned or connected with what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Aware of the body, maybe of the breath, maybe of feelings or emotions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "There is happening here in your experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Can that be allowed? Can that be okay that it is arising and received? Meeting it, greeting it kind of with a friendly attention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "This receptive side of the practice can be so supportive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just opening and receiving what's already happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe exploring what's obvious in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Can there be a relaxed receiving of experience? For some, it can be helpful to allow that receiving to attune to a particular aspect of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe for some of you, it may be fine to settle back and see what wants to show up and just allow that to be received."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "For some, it can be helpful to attune perhaps to maybe the breath or a larger sense of the body sitting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the experience of hearing, some area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then receiving that, receiving a breath, receiving body sensations or receiving sound."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just remembering in a light way to stay connected to receiving experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And of course the mind will wander and will forget to be attentive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "At some point, the mind will remember."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's a gift that moment when mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Conditions supported the re-arising of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And can the mind in that moment just receive that mindfulness has returned? And what's obvious in that moment? Obvious in that moment may be connected to where the mind was a few moments before in thoughts or wandering and feeling an emotion of some kind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It may be that that's there in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "That's what's being received."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "That's where to begin again with what's already here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Perhaps broadening to reconnect with the breath or the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "But more of a sense of letting the breath come back to you or the body sensations come back to you as opposed to the idea of you're in control and dragging the mind around."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's kind of like allowing your mindfulness to respect what the mind is already doing in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Receiving relaxed, receptive awareness."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "So visando la musculatura de la espalda."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Cerrando los ojos suavemente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Empezamos por sentir la respiración en nuestro cuerpo."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Donde nuestro cuerpo sentimos el movimiento al respirar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si surgen sonidos externos, simplemente tomamos nota."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Nos permitimos surgir, estamos conscientes como surgen y como desaparecen."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Sentimos como se elevan los hombos al respirar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Al inhalar subo levemente al exhalar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Observamos si el abdomen se expande."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si hay pensamientos, los ofrecemos una nota mental."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y no nos involucramos con el contenido."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Regresamos a darle atención a nuestro cuerpo."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Puscando a traer la mente a donde esté el cuerpo."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No es necesario juzgar, permitimos nuestra experiencia tal cual es."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y con cariño tratamos de sabizar el área alrededor del núcleo de tensión."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Podemos también observar las sensaciones de la atención."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Cómo se comportan los músculos cuando están bajo tensión."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Es una tensión constante o no."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Tiene una textura, una cierta temperatura."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Buscamos familiarizarnos con nuestro cuerpo tal cual es."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Afreciéndole una aceptación radical."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si la mente divaga, cariñosamente digamos, ahora no."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ahora solo queremos estar presentes a nuestra experiencia corporal."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Cuando nos damos cuenta que no hay nada que tengamos que solucionar por ahora o planear o recordar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No simplemente estar aquí."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ya que no si hay tensión en nuestro cuello especialmente en la parte que conecta la nuca."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Vean si es posible suavizar un poco."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Dejarte los hombres bajen aunque sea un poco más."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Este soltar en la musculatura es algo que vamos aprendiendo a hacer."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "La parte profunda de nuestro cuerpo soltamos y inmediatamente hay un alivio."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Imaginemos que nuestro cuerpo es un recipiente amplo que le da cavidad a cualquier experiencia que tengamos en el momento."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y no solamente le da cavidad, pero le ofrece un abrazo de aceptación tal cual es."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si quema las rubillas, este es otra área en que tendemos a tensar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ahora, observemos si entra más aire de un lado o otro de nuestras fuerzas nasales."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Sentamos el aire como entra."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Vean si es posible descubrir si la temperatura del aire es distinta."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Es distinta cuando inhalamos y cuando exhalamos."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Poniendo nuestra tensión entre las foces nasales y el labio superior."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ese es nuestro punto de vigilancia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Con dulzura la regresamos a nuestro cuerpo al punto de vigilancia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No hay necesidad de recriminar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ahora vamos a cambiar el punto de vigilancia del labio superior al abdomen."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Approximadamente dos pulgadas debajo de lo embligo, ahí va a ser nuestro nuevo punto de vigilancia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Observemos las sensaciones corporales."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Cuando ponemos nuestro punto de vigilancia en este nuevo lugar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Exhalamos como se siente la respiración ahora."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si hay tensión digamos en el diafrarme, pongamos nuestra tensión en ese lugar."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Traigamos nuestra respiración a esa área."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si alguna otra experiencia predomina en el momento, ya sea una sensación corporal, ya sea un sonido, un olor."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Llevamos nuestra tensión a esta nueva experiencia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "De nuevo recorremos nuestro cuerpo con nuestra tensión."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Sintamos el contacto de nuestras caderas sobre el cojín o sobre la silla."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Renewamos nuestra postura, alerta y al mismo tiempo relajada."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Esta postura comunica dignidad, paz y tranquilidad."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Pongamos nuestra tensión de nuevo a la inhalación y la exhalación."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Vamos a ver si nos es posible poner nuestra atención a una inhalación completa y una exhalación completa."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si estamos bajos de energía, hagamos nuestras inhalaciones más largas."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si estamos ansiosos, hagamos nuestras exhalaciones más largas."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Vamos a adoptar nuestra respiración según nuestro estado físico."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Soltando de nuevo el cuello, los hombros."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y hagamos conciencia si este ajuste a nuestra respiración trajo consigo un cambio de energía."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando nuestra postura de nuevo."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando que nuestra espalda esté derecha y alerta."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y al alargar la espina dorsal teniendo cuidado que no pongamos tensión en las caderas o los muslos."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Es simplemente un alargar sin afectar nuestra base."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y en los últimos minutos que nos quedan, vamos a ofrecer las frases de meta a nosotros mismos."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Esta es la repetimos en silencio nuestra mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Que yo esté protegida de daños externos e internos."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Que mi corazón tenga una abundancia de amor bundadoso."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No tomamos tres respiraciones para terminar lo más profundas posibles."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Y cuando estén listos, abren los ojos."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No tomamos tres respiraciones para terminar lo más profundas posibles."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No tomamos tres respiraciones para terminar lo más profundas."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Starting in a simple way, just remembering yourself in this moment, connecting to your experience in a simple way, maybe just acknowledging this body sitting in this space and the place you're in, being with yourself here and now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "In some ways, as I land and I'm sitting, it feels kind of like gathering or collecting or just arriving."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "There's not a lot of intense focus at the beginning, but just I'm like, yep, I'm sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "There's body, there's feelings in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "There's a breathing, the breathing's happening, the experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "There's some emotions and moods going on."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "What's happening there? Just in general, how are you in the broader sense of how are you? Seeing if you can touch into the feeling of how you are in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Not thinking about it, not the idea about it, but the feeling, the felt sense of the whole of you in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "That kind of receptivity does, is supported by relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Not looking for or trying to figure out, but really just to relax and be willing to kind of see or experience or feel what's here, what's available, what's already here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "And often at the beginning, this kind of gathering or landing with experience, it's not necessarily very precise, may feel kind of vague or diffuse, and that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Just, can you be with yourself in this vague, diffuse way in this moment, acknowledging how you are, maybe some tiredness, maybe some curiosity, maybe some restlessness, maybe some calm, maybe some thinking, maybe some tension in the body, maybe some relaxation, how are you in this moment? And relaxation does support this, so it can be helpful to having kind of taken in how you are in this first part, investigate or not so much investigate or try to figure anything out, but just see if there's a willingness to relax in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the face and head and neck can relax a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the shoulders, the arms, the hands can relax a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the chest and upper back can relax and soften."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe all those muscles across the stomach and abdomen can relax a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "We often hold that area kind of almost subconsciously, so maybe it can hang a little bit forward."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the middle and lower back and hips can relax, the legs, the feet."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "And then too, perhaps there can be some softening or deeply inside the body in the center of the core of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the heart can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "This inner relaxation often isn't a doing, it's not something we can often try to do, but if we just kind of attend to those areas with the invitation, we're checking in, a seeing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Are you willing to relax or maybe do you know how to relax? We don't know consciously how to relax those areas, but a gentle kind of touching in and invitation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the throat, the heart, the stomach, the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "And then from this place of as much relaxation as is available, stepping away from the intention towards looking at their body through relaxation and just be curious about how is the body in this moment? What do you notice? What's available? Maybe the breath is kind of obvious or contact, sensations of the hips against the chair, cushion, maybe the feet or the hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe there's a broader sense of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe perhaps there's an area of stronger sensation where the attention is drawn."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "It's just receiving what's obvious in the field of bodily experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Can there continue to be some measure of relaxation as you're receiving whatever is obvious? Relaxed and aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "If the attention is drawn to connecting with some particular area of experience like the breath, that's fine."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Can there be relaxed and aware of breathing? Or perhaps attention is taking in sound."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Can there be relaxed and aware of hearing? Or maybe the attention is shifting first the body, some particular sensation in the body, then another sensation in the body and then hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Can there be a relaxed awareness of this shifting attention? Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the sound, relaxed with the body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Or if a particular mood or emotion comes in, feels like that's pulling at the attention, can there be relaxed and aware of that emotion? Can just being with yourself, with your body, with hearing, with emotions, relaxed and aware."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Relaxed with this breath, relaxed with the body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This afternoon, I thought of continuing the reflection on conditionality, primarily from the perspective of the teaching of dependent co-arising, paticha samukhada, dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I'm not planning to do a detailed dive into all of the links like I sometimes do, but just kind of give a broad brush sense of dependent origination and then dive into a couple of the links more particularly ones that kind of feel more along the lines of a conversation that feels like it's in process."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The Buddha taught paticha samukhada, the dependent co-arising condition, dependent origination as a general principle stated in a very broad brush form, when this is, that is."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this arises, that arises, and to me, this expresses kind of two different aspects of conditionality."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this is, that is, it's kind of the expression of things arising together."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this arises, that arises, to me, can be more the conditions shaping the future, or in the sense of conditions leading in a direction."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Then the other half of the general principle of conditionality is when this isn't, that isn't."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this ceases, that ceases."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it expresses both how things come to be and how things fall apart."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There are some different instantiations or particular elaborations of this general principle in the suttas, one set of those elaborations, and there are a couple of different, maybe as many as three, different forms of the principle of dependent origination that describes the arising of suffering, describing the arising of suffering and the sense of selfing, the selfing that is believed to be an abiding entity."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So dependent origination in one form expresses that how suffering comes to be, it's a very detailed description in one form, it's twelve links that describe how suffering comes to be, and that's the more familiar, to most of us, the more familiar formulation, there's another one that uses ten links, that it's a kind of a description of what goes on in our system, in our human system, it answers the question essentially that so many people have, it's like, why, why does this happen, you know, why, why does this go on? And he describes, the Buddha describes just this kind of unfolding chain, the tumbling on that when not seen, it just tends to keep tumbling on in that direction, conditioning more suffering, conditioning more sense of selfing."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There's another description of the general formulation that has a completely different direction, it points to or describes the conditions that support the movement to freedom, and so this is a lovely reflection, I think knowing holding these two together, there are conditions that support the arising of suffering, and that's kind of common, it's more than kind of, it's the habit of the human mind to follow that pattern, but it is conditioned, it's not the fact that it's described as a conditioned unfolding, means that if the conditions are shifted or dismantled, then the suffering falls apart."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I think of the description of the specific instantiation, the specific describing of dependent origination connected with the arising of suffering to be propelled by, it's propelled by ignorance, it's propelled by craving, essentially it's propelled by greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So that's kind of the cycle of dependent origination is conditioned by greed, aversion, and delusion, and then in turn, conditions more, greed, aversion, and delusion, which is kind of why it's hard to break out of, like I was saying this morning around the job description, like of aversion, when aversion arises in the mind, it tends to condition the mind to look for things to be averse to, which conditions more aversion, so it's hard to break out of these cycles without some understanding of how the cycle is being propelled onward by greed, aversion, and delusion, and the ignorance underlying greed, aversion, and delusion that propels this whole cycle, but the kind of flip side of having another set of conditions that lead to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Both of these chains include suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The one chain describes how suffering comes to be, and then kind of inferentially that that suffering tends to, because it's based in the belief, like for instance, with aversion, the belief that aversion, getting rid of this thing, that separation from something is what's going to make me happy, that that belief then propels more aversion, and so tends to, when the suffering arises in connection with aversion, it tends to, the mind tends to be confused about how happiness comes to be, and it just keeps going in that cycle, and so suffering tends to, can tend to reproduce more suffering, but the other chain, chain of transcendent dependent origination, sometimes it's called the sutta that, in which that teaching is described, the name of that sutta is something like supportive conditions, the Upanisha sutta, supportive conditions for freedom, and it kind of begins with suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Suffering may lead in the direction of ignorance, bewilderment, infusion, repeating the patterns, and it can also lead, if there is a teaching that points out of that cycle, that says, hey, there is a way to kind of break that cycle, then that suffering joined with hearing that teaching can lead to faith, which in the other day, I'm talking about the five faculties, faith being one of the five faculties, when there is faith arising, it can lead to engagement, practice, exploring a whole different approach, and so these two chains kind of overlap at suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Suffering is both a supportive condition for more suffering, and suffering is a supportive condition for freedom, when it is met with wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So that's a delightful reflection for me."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This unfolding, tumbling on of conditions isn't destined to continue recreating suffering when we bring the understanding."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The understanding of suffering is essentially the key, the linchpin, when we can understand suffering, first noble truth, understand suffering, understand how suffering arises."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So today I mostly want to kind of look at the description of how suffering is created in a kind of a broad brush fashion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's a pretty clear unpacking, as I said this morning, the Buddha was amazing at describing the workings of the human mind and the teaching of dependent origination in terms of its description of how suffering comes to be, is one of the examples of the complexity of how the human mind works."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But it's a clear description that suffering comes to be independence on conditions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So suffering is conditioned, it is not in the Buddha's teaching of this, it's not foregone conclusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Now here we do have to distinguish the difference between suffering and what the Buddha meant by the kind of suffering we can be free of."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "He did not mean that we will be free from unpleasant sensation."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So that's not the freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But rather, in many places the Buddha kind of describes, or it seems to me that one of the clearest, most succinct definitions of freedom, the freedom from suffering the Buddha pointed to, he said, the absence of greed, the absence of aversion, the absence of delusion, this is Nibbana, this is freedom, this is release, this is cooling, the fire, cooling the fire."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so the suffering that can end is the suffering of greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So greed, aversion and delusion can cease."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So this chain of suffering can be created and it describes, this chain describes essentially starting from, I'll just name them first and then I'll go through them a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So starting with ignorance, ignorance of suffering basically is the head of the chain."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "With ignorance as condition, mental formations come to be."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Mental formations, independence on ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So certain kinds of mental formations come to be, independence on ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Independence on ignorance, mental formations come to be."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "With mental formations as a condition, consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "With consciousness as condition, mental and physical processes come to be."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The six sense spaces follow or arise with contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming, birth, aging in death."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "As the Buddha often says at that point, when he says aging in death, he says, and there you have the entire mass of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So the way this is often explored in a pedagogical fashion in terms of a teaching methodology is that that entire mass of suffering tends to loop back to create ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mentioned this earlier that there's a statement the Buddha made, you know, suffering leads to either bewilderment, confusion, ignorance or search."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And if that search is met with a teaching that describes a different way, that can lead to faith."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So there's that branching point."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So often this cycle describes from ignorance all the way around through suffering, but often what happens there with all of that suffering is that the ignorance is reinforced."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it tends to be experienced as a cycle."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's a complex teaching, lots to it."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And I often find it easiest to kind of enter into this description or this discussion by starting not with ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, I've talked a little bit about ignorance now, but those first few links, ignorance, conditions, mental formations, conditions, consciousness, conditions, mind and mental and physical processes, to me those were so hard to get through."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It was like a slog when I was first hearing about this."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And by the time I got to the things that seemed more clear, I was exhausted."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So I like to start where it's a little easier to kind of get some traction with what the teachings are saying."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, you know, we start this week, let's start with, we've got a mind and a body."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We've got these, these six in spaces, we've got mental and physical processes."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We've got this body kind of sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And this body tends to be impinged on by sight, sound, smells, taste, touch, things going on in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's the next link we have because we have these, this minded body and these six sense bases."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We see, we hear, we smell, we taste, we touch."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so this is the description of this is contact."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We're contacted by experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There's contact with the sensors and each of those contacts arising, co-arising with each of those contacts."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I think of that as the, you know, when this is, that is kind of arising."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Arising with each of those contacts is also a feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's either pleasant, it's unpleasant or it's neither pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Now, I think that part of, partly there's other things that arise at the same time as that contact."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Perception, for instance, arises with that contact."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But here the Buddha is highlighting the conditions leading to suffering in a particular way."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There are other places where the Buddha talks about chains that are kind of chaining off of perception."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But here he's really kind of emphasizing in some ways this feeling piece and how suffering is created because we don't understand feeling and because the habits of greed, aversion and delusion tend to respond to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So the, with every sense contact, there is a feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And based on that feeling tone, the mind tends to, because it's, you know, infused with the habitual perspective of, get what I want, get rid of what I don't want, it shifts from, you know, that kind of bare sense of, oh, this is a pleasant thing, to wanting to hold on to pleasant, to wanting to get rid of unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Maybe not really noticing the neutral experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So there's that movement, that shift or that kind of arising."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This to me is like when this arises, that tends to arise."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This is that form of dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When feeling arises, craving tends to arise."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And in this case, the craving will arise when there's ignorance in the mind, when there is the perspective of already the perspective of, if I get this thing that's pleasant, I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that's in a way how this whole chain is shaped by the ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, and we could say too that, you know, that feeling and craving will be more co-arising when ignorance is present in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When feeling is arising in the condition of mind, of ignorance, where there's not mindfulness, there's the views and beliefs around greed and aversion that are motivating the mind, feeling will lead to craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Because the mind doesn't have another perspective it can work from."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, feeling tends to lead to craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We want to get what's pleasant, get rid of what's unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And this is also a very, you know, it's based in evolutionary biology as well, you know, this tendency to go for, you know, what's pleasant, to get rid of what's unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Even, you know, single-celled creatures tend to do, you know, move towards nourishment and away from noxious chemicals."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, it's very deeply ingrained there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Some of the conditioning comes, some of the conditioning around that movement from feeling to craving comes from our own learning, our own kind of what we've experienced in the past and the getting the sense that, oh, if I get a thing I want, I get that little hit of like, it's okay, it feels pretty good."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, we learn ourselves that and we don't have an example of a different way, a different kind of happiness of recognizing that the release from greed and aversion is actually a different kind of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so, we end up, you know, just kind of having that co-arising or that very conditioned arising when ignorance is present in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like the chain of suffering gets picked up when feeling arises, craving arises."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, that craving, you know, that's a very habitual response based on that feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Craving to get, craving to get rid of."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "With craving arises the desire to have or get rid of the actual, I mean, the actual doing of the having or the getting rid of, that's the clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, I think of craving and clinging as kind of being gradations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like the craving is the movement towards, yeah, that looks good, and the clinging is, got it."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Following on from craving and clinging, some teachers, Tanasaro Biku, says that the kind of the intentions that are formed in the service of that, that clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like the need to keep this, the identity that forms around the one who has this thing, the sense of control that one has all of that, the intentions and actions that arise, independence or in service of that craving and clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's what we could call becoming."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, again, it's the kind of the movement towards, okay, I've got this thing, I need to control it."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I need to make sure I keep this, I need to make sure I keep this at bay."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I need to make sure everybody knows I've got this."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's that kind of terrain of becoming."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then, again, kind of in a shading manner, like I just talked about from craving to clinging, that's I kind of, I also think of becoming to birth."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And in this case, I'm looking at or exploring this chain of dependent origination, not in terms of birth into a new life, but just birth into an identity, really kind of solidifying, this is me, this is who I am, kind of a reification or an intensification of that becoming."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Like clinging is an intensification of craving, birth is an intensification of becoming, a clear sense of I am the one who has this control."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like the becoming is the, oh yeah, I'm going to be the person everybody admires and respects."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And the birth is, I am the person everybody admires and respects."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And the Buddha says it from this place, or actually I think, I think from craving, you know, right from craving, right from the get-go, craving is already suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "You know, this whole thing that says then, you know, the entire mass of suffering with aging and death, it's like, in my experience, when craving arises, suffering is already arising."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's not like we have to wait to experience suffering until there's becoming and birth and aging and death."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Although some of that birth, you know, that sense of I am the one who has that respect, that sense of identity masks the suffering of the craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's got this like, it's so world, our mind is constructed and the mind has taken up residence and that almost like fantasy like place, and it's kind of happy with that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But that construction, it's, you know, it's a bubble in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's actually pretty ready to be birthed as soon as there's some kind of evidence to the contrary."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Or something happens where we don't have control of that thing we thought we had control of."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "At one point on a retreat, I kept kind of flipping between this sense of, I'm a good yogi."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And I can't even be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And just like these flipping between these identities."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Because, you know, it's like sometimes the practice was unfolding in a way that there was clarity and understanding."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And sometimes the practice was unfolding in the way that there was confusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "No self needs to be involved there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But there was an identification that came along with both of those and suffering around that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like, I could only be happy as long as that was still perceived to be the case."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And evidence came along regularly to show that I couldn't control that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That I couldn't control whether I was always experiencing things in the practice the way I thought a good yogi would."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that sense of identification, that sense of I am and that whole complex of fantasy there, it will burst at some point."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's the aging and death of that identity."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And suffering results there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then coming back to the beginning of the chain."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, as I said a few moments ago, the suffering there, like, I'm a failure."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I'm not the person everybody admires and respects."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I'm not the person I admire and respect."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's one of the ones I had."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When all we understand is the motivations based in greed, aversion, and delusion, when that's the conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We think, okay, I'm a failure, so what do I need to do? I need to work harder to prove that I can be that good yogi."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that that greed and that sense of aversion to the failure and all of that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's like believing that reality of that need to have that identity leads into another kind of the ignorance that, first of all, that ignorance of it, that that identity even has an existence."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And that it's important to keep that identity going."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Then not understanding suffering as a part of that ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, that ignorance is really motivated by those beliefs I talked about this morning in the job description of aversion, you know, the belief around, that's motivating aversion is that if I get rid of this thing, I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The belief motivating greed is if I get this thing, I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So these are kind of, this is the ignorance embedded in greed and aversion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then the more fundamental ignorance aversion says, this is what will make me happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, greed says, this is what will make me happy aversion getting rid of this will make me happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Delusion says there is a me to make happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's kind of the foundational ignorance and not understanding suffering, not understanding that these, this propelling of acting on those beliefs is what is productive of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So this ignorance, as I mentioned a few moments ago, it's like this ignorance is the like, it's the, it's the like launching pad for the entire chain towards suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "You know, when ignorance is arising, and that belief already when we're starting from the perspective, I need to get something pleasant and or to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When that's what's motivating the mind, then pleasant feeling is going to lead to craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Unpleasant feeling is going to lead to aversion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So when the ignorance is motivating the mind, it's like, already those conditions are the stages set for the craving, the clinging, the becoming to happen with that ignorance in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So the next part of the chain when with ignorance as condition, mental formations come to be."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Well, this is again the, not, these are the mental formations that arise independence on ignorance, independence on that underlying belief."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So with the underlying belief, getting what I want will lead to happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That tends to condition greed, the mental formation of greed."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so greed arising in the mind, aversion arising in the mind, and we tend to have habitual, you know, kind of go to belief strategies for happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "My own tends to be, if I get rid of things that are unpleasant, then I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "You know, so leading this mind to walk into a room and kind of search out all the unpleasant things, trying to figure out how to get rid of them so that I can finally relax that strategy, that, that ignorance or that kind of condition of the ignorance around aversion, leading to, you know, the strategy of aversion in the mind, thinking it's going in the direction of happiness, but actually it's moving in the direction of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so these mental formations conditioned by ignorance, there's a lot of different ways that we, that these come into, into being and, you know, the, the foundational ones I've just mentioned around greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Many of those are, are kind of based in our, you know, humanness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I think it's very rare for a human being to be born that does not have this tendency to want to get pleasant things, to want to get rid of unpleasant things."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I don't know if such a being would be born."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It seems very deeply rooted in being human, that this pattern is there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So some of these patterns, these, these habits of mental formations rooted in ignorance seem to come with being human and come with a misunderstanding about, kind of misperceptions about experience, taking things to be permanent, taking things to be reliable."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So some of, and as I said, I think I said earlier, you know, that those strategies or those, kind of human conditions, those human proclivities are reinforced by our own experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And we find out as we, you know, from the time we're really young, you know, if I cry and mom comes and makes me feel better, you know, it's, if I'm uncomfortable and I cry, mom comes and makes me feel better."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And it's like this reinforcement of, you know, acting on this strategy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And it keeps us alive, you know."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's not, I'm not suggesting that we, you know, try to train babies not to cry so moms don't come."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, that's not what I'm saying here."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But I'm just saying that how habitual it is and that we learn in our lives that this strategy is at least effective to give us a little bit of happiness, a little bit of sense of, oh, okay, got it."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And, you know, that's about all that we ever learn about happiness for most of us."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When I get something I want, I feel good."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I feel happy when I get rid of something that I don't want."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I've got a sense of control."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that reinforces, you know, it reinforces our own experience of this is the way to go to happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then there's a lot of other conditions in our own, our own lives, you know, how we've been responded to and what our physical body, you know, can handle or not handle the kind of, you know, certain bodies can tolerate certain foods and not other foods."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so there's all kinds of conditions that come that shape us and our responses to the world."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I remember at one point, you know, how I got really annoyed at somebody is this was like I was in my early twenties or something and I went over to somebody's house and, you know, and, you know, they had, they served lettuce and this salad and I tended to like one kind of lettuce and they had, you know, used another kind of lettuce."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And I heard this thought in my mind, don't they know I like this kind of lettuce? I was like, no, of course not."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "You know, but this kind of belief that the world should be, you know, organized around my own happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So some of those, you know, kind of preferences and views, you know, are shaped by our own personal experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then some of them are also shaped by, you know, how our families are and what culture we grew up in, no culture in a way could be seen as shared beliefs, shared mental formations, shared views."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "These kind of mental formations, you know, what, what, you know, it's like they often are harder to see because what you're growing up with, people around you are reinforcing those beliefs, those views."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so those things just become true or normal."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So for example, mental formations around the idea of race, views, beliefs, ideas connected to that idea."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Many of us grow up, or maybe even all of us grow up with some perspectives around race, some skillful, some not so skillful."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And often those, you know, shared beliefs, shared perspectives are harder to see, harder to recognize as mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's just taken to be, this is the nature of the way the world is."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's taken to be some kind of global or like more wide-ranging truth."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And a lot of suffering comes from those kind of, you could call them collective mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But we each, you know, kind of have internalized these collective mental formations, these views, these beliefs from our cultures, from our families."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so this is a place that I wanted to linger because yesterday I was kind of reflecting on the internal and the external."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And this is a place where the internally external meet, the external conditions of our culture, of our family shaping our views, shaping our beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We don't, we're not born with these views of beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "They are taught to us, often not so much by words saying, this is what you'll believe, but just through how people behave."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The actions, the intentions are absorbed."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And I think that's another reason why they're harder to see."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Because they're not so much articulated as propositions in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "They've been absorbed through kind of actions, intentions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so, you know, the mental formations that we have received, if we think about from the time where we were children, we received a lot of views, beliefs, ideas, opinions that have kind of informed."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And some of these include, you know, the whole reinforcement around get what you want, you'll be happy, get rid of what you want, you'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Those are also reinforced with our cultural perspectives, sometimes in particular ways."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Get these things you'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "In this particular culture, or many of the threads of the culture in this country, the work really hard you'll be happy is a kind of a condition."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That other places, there's maybe different things that are valued."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So we absorb all of these from the time that we're very young."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then we just, you know, they become part of that cycle of dependent origination, they become part of us, they become part of how we act."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "They shape our intentions, they shape our cravings, they shape our clinging or becoming what we value, the wanting to be the someone who's admired and respected, all coming from these kind of collective mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so we've been informed by the external."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I think I'm thinking of this right now in this like figure eight kind of thing."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The mental formations of others, one chain of dependent origination right here, the mental formations of others being transmitted to us, us picking up those mental formations in our chain following on and our own, our own mental formations have an effect, not only in our own mind, but also affect others."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We've been affected by others, their views, their opinions, their ideas."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And in the conditions of the world when where mindfulness and wisdom are not widely available, we tend to just pick them up without discernment and act on them and contribute back to that broader condition in the world of these mental formations swimming that we're all swimming in."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Buddha used the phrase to see if I can find the place this is in the sutras that this practice or this middle ways, it's like swimming against the stream."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And this is my image that these this currents of the stream of mental formations that we're all swimming in, it's really hard to see this current, this direction, that there's another, there's another way because everything, all of the mental formations that we're exposed to or most of the mental formations we're exposed to until we come into the Dharma is this direction of mental formations based on greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So we have these these the cycle that not only are we receiving our mental formations from the kind of collective pool of mental formations, but we're contributing those mental formations, we're contributing because our mental formations lead to actions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This is another kind of place of the teaching in the five aggregates, mental formations is one of the five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It describes, in one teaching it describes the five aggregates as processes."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, you know, the process of the body is the process of the body that is contacted basically."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then feeling it says why is it called feeling because it feels feeling feels perceiving perceives consciousness knows mental formations he says, mental formations form."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "What do they form? They form the experience of the body and feeling and perception and knowing and mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This is the definition of the process of mental formations that that is the constructor of experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It is described as being that which constructs the aggregates, the other aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So mental formation constructs form constructs feeling constructs perception in line with its intentions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So when anger arises, it shapes the body, it contorts the face, heat perhaps arises in the system."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The body changes with the arising of anger."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It shapes the feeling things tend to become unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We tend to look for unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It shapes perception, perhaps seeing things as a threat."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It shapes the knowing, it shapes that we tend to orient to things to be angry about, perhaps one version of that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And it tends to construct more anger."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So all of the arising of mental formation internally conditions our aggregates, conditions us towards acting out of that experience, acting out of that anger in this case."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that then contributes into the pool."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When others are present, they are experiencing that contortion of our face that those verbal darts that are being sent."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, we all know that experience of when somebody is angry and we're there in the room with them, it tends to, you know, make us feel angry or defensive or, you know, lash out sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So external anger tends to create internal anger."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so for us too, when we have anger, it can tend to create the conditions for it to arise in others, not only arise internally but externally."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Not necessarily if there is mindfulness available, not necessarily, but often habitually anger internally conditions, creates conditions for anger to arise in others."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So we are, you know, in this intertwined loop of dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So our mental formations tend to affect what we become aware of."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And when we have an intention in a particular direction, this is a kind of a neutral function of mind in a way that when the mind is oriented around a particular intention, this is called selective attention in our psychological descriptions these days, selective attention."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When there's a kind of an intention in the mind of focus, our mind tends to screen in things that are relevant to that intention and screen out things that are not relevant to that intention."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This can be very useful if we're trying to do something very focused."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Kind of helps to kind of weed out what's not relevant to the task related to that intention."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So that can be a kind of a neutral process in our minds but often that neutral process is co-opted by unwholesome mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So when the intention of anger, aversion, greed is arising in the mind, the mind tends to orient towards taking in from the environment things that are relevant around that mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So if we're angry, we tend to take in things that are relevant to that anger, proof of why we should be angry, not seeing correspondingly things that are maybe not, um, that are counter to that perspective."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This kind of happens a lot."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We take in information that confirms our biases."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We do not see things that don't confirm our biases."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So knowing that, you know, having that information can be really useful so that when we see our mind heading in that direction, you know, heading towards being shaped by a particular intention, when mindfulness comes we might be curious, well, you know, what other information is here? I brought that in the other day."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "What else is here? What am I missing? And then, so that consciousness, what we are conscious of, so what we are, what we become aware of is already filtered based on ignorance, based on our mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So coming back to this place of the dependent origination where we're looking at the mind and body receiving sense impressions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We are not this kind of blank slate receiving all sense impressions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "We are already filtering things based on our proclivities."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So that first time through looking at, oh, we've got this mind and body and their sights and sounds and spells and taste and touch."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Well, those sights and sounds and smells and tastes and touch and the things arising in our mind have been shaped already by this whole stream of mental formations, conditioning, the ignorance and our own kind of our own conditions have radically shaped what gets through."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So fortunately, it is possible to change the conditions of this cycle with mindfulness and wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Often the feeling craving link is described as a place to kind of burst that cycle noticing."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's just pleasant feeling, you know, when we can really be at that place just knowing this is pleasant sensation, it kind of begins to, you know, it may undermine that kind of the belief or the automatic movement to craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When feeling tone is met with some wisdom, it can kind of change the direction."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily have to go towards craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So I was thinking about this earlier today."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I thought, well, that kind of teaching around the feeling craving link and, you know, we can break the cycle of dependent origination at feeling."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That feels like a very personal perspective around dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That will break the cycle in this being internally or can break that cycle."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There's another exploration around becoming awake to the chains, the components of this chain."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There's one particular teaching in the Majama Nikaya, it's Majama 9 for those of you who are interested in this, that describes each and every link of dependent origination and points to bringing wise attention to each and every link."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When we understand mental formations arising, mental formations, that it is a mental formation, that it's arising, that it can cease."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "There can be freedom right there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And that's true of craving, of clinging, of becoming wherever we are, whatever we are waking up to, wherever we end up waking up in that chain, or whatever is obvious for us in that, the sense of self, the experience of craving and suffering, whatever is obvious there, when mindfulness and wisdom can meet that, ignorance can be kind of released and freedom can happen right there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so I was reflecting on the mental formation link and how an exploration of understanding mental formation, understanding mental formation as arising, understanding mental formation as ceasing, and thinking about it internally and externally too, the conversation we were having yesterday, the knowing, oh, there's mental formation arising externally, there's anger arising externally, there's frustration arising internally, there's greed arising internally, there's confusion arising externally."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And we can see that, and as the commentaries pointed to, either the internal or the external deep seeing of things as arising and ceasing in this way can lead to realization."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I was reflecting that this exploration around mental formations in particular might be a way to contribute to a different composition of that stream of mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it's not hopeless by any means, but it does take the courage, I think it takes a lot of courage to watch these processes unfolding both internally and externally, and not respond habitually, but respond instead from this perspective of mindfulness and wisdom that brings in the relational brahma-vaharas, brings in love and compassion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And we see internally the way this chain unfolds, and understand, some of you mentioned this in some of the meetings, right, this is not just about me, there's a way that the seeing of it internally can help us to appreciate kind of like, at one point I saw, or saw how my own mind was heading in the direction of anger to a particular person and how I wanted them to be miserable, I wanted them to suffer."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And in that moment, seeing that clearly and feeling the kind of chain that was propelling me in that direction, there was also the understanding like the extrapolation, this is happening six billion times over in the world, no wonder it's such a mess."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And it led to a sense of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so this exploration brings in wisdom, but also brings in those relational qualities of love, compassion and joy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And the Buddha said it is possible, it is possible to free the mind from greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "He said to his followers, if it were not possible, I wouldn't ask you to do it."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So let's just sit for a moment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So good morning, or good afternoon, or good evening."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes when people talk about their Dharma practice, they use language that implies that the Dharma is somehow distinct from other parts of life."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, for example, at the end of retreat, people often say, so, when I go back to regular life, or if they're talking about their cushion practice, they might say, in the rest of life, such and such is like that, but here on the cushion it's different, or in my normal life, such and such."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So all of these ways of speaking maybe indicate that somewhere in our mind we have the idea that the Dharma is different from the rest of life, or that practice is somehow distinct from the rest of life."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So this, maybe even without realizing it, we've made a little distinction like that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So I'm calling this talk, The Dharma Life, and I want to talk a little bit about the, our interface between what we think of as our life and the Dharma and practice and how we can live in a way that is where those are somewhat connected."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And it may be that that's not an issue in your life or not interesting, and that's fine."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Or it might be that that is interesting, but you're not sure how to do that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Or it might be that you're trying really, really hard to connect everything together and almost the harder you try, the less it works."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I think there will be something for everyone."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "When I went to practice in Sri Lanka a few years ago, the monk that I was practicing with was named Dhamma Jiva, which means Dharma life."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And I think it suited him."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And he really had taken things in."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So in this book, The First Free Women, it's a kind of an interpretation of the Terigata, the poems of the awakened nuns."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "There's this verse, which I also read during the meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "This is from the nun Sakula."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "If there is something in these teachings calling out to you, it's because something in you is calling out to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "The path will take you whenever you're ready, just as you are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So I want to talk a bit about this."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That last phrase, just as you are, is so important in practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's such an important idea."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And the context is that the path will take us when we're ready, whenever we're ready, just as we are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So it's not really that we need to be different."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that has to do somehow with our relationship to the teachings and our relationship to practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So what is this being ready? It seems to be kind of a balance or middle way among a number of different relationships that we might have to practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And it's something that we explore in our self over time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But one relationship that I want to start with, because it's such a common one, is to see our practice as the ultimate self improvement project."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so we use various reflection or self assessment tools, and we come up with an idea or a list almost of what our issues or our difficulties are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then we come up with some strategies for addressing those."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And I'm making it very explicit."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I don't know if not everyone does it so explicitly, but we can check, you know, maybe even subtly in our mind, we have this idea."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So for example, we might decide that we have an issue with anger."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so we're going to try anger management workshops, and we're going to do nonviolent communication so that we can connect better with people that we find irritating."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we're going to do psychotherapy in order to work out the issues of our upbringing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then we're going to do meditation for calming the mind and opening the heart."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So we have subtly in our mind kind of this list of things that we're going to address through various practices."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So let me say first of all that all of those things are great things to do that are very valuable, and they do reduce suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "However, what I'm pointing to here is that kind of background idea going on, where we have an idea of what the issues are that we know, we know this is it, and we're going to work on that by doing various things."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "There's a sort of a rational plan is a sort of a rational plan."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And the subtle conclusion is that when I've really processed all of these things that I'm working on, then I will be well on my way to awakening."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that's what it's going to take."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And maybe a subtler underlying attitude there is the idea that awakening means that all of my rough spots are going to be smoothed out and all of my oddities are going to go away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And I'm going to become that ideal person that I imagine I can be."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So I'm being pretty kind of direct and not because this is a completely wrong approach, but just because we have to be aware if we have that attitude."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's, but what maybe just I'll give you now an example of something that happened for someone I know in practice, which is that they began just following the meditation instructions, you know, follow the breath, when the mind wanders away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Let go of that and return to the breath really stay connected to the body sensations and the breath in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And they did that pretty diligently for a number of months, I think it was."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then they noticed to their surprise that they were less angry at work."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And this was a little bit shocking to them because they thought, wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "The anger is going to be reduced doesn't that shouldn't I have had to work directly on the anger and shouldn't release probably I should have done that to practice but suddenly it's just like there's just less reactivity less prone, less being prone to anger."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So it was surprising because all they've been doing was trying to follow their breath for some period of time per day."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes works like this."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes we work directly with things but sometimes we don't have to work directly on things for them to fall away the path works a little bit in sometimes in unseen ways and sometimes in surprising ways."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so it's important to be open to that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Not to feel that everything has to be managed directly by working on that exact thing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Who knows and we might in some ways reinforce difficulties by working on them directly."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "You know if we make us the more we see I'm an angry person I've got to work on this anger I have this problem with anger or sadness or depression."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "We almost reify it in a certain way."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's a little bit of subtlety there in knowing that our mind has certain tendencies but not making them into a self not identifying them with how we are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So sometimes it's best just to return to the breath and be surprised where that can take us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's not that we don't ever work on things but sometimes I can also bring up say an attitude of a version."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "We can decide if we've decided that this is the good part of my mind and this is the bad part of my mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And I have to work on the bad part and make it go away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then only the good will be left."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's a particular again that's a particular attitude about practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So we don't want to be cultivating that sense of a version to part of our mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So I would say this is a way if we've made this big division between good and evil in the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's a way that we might not be quite ready for the for the path to come and take us referring back to the quote."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "As our awareness gets more steady and you know by just cultivating mindfulness and daily life and regular sitting practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "There's a way in which we're less likely to get overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Then we can start maybe practicing with the idea that certain things will untangle themselves if we're just give them some space and see see them clearly."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So we're certainly not going to deny that there are various difficulties in the mind coming up."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But there is a sort of an attitude we can have where if I see this, there's some part of it that can disentangle itself."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then maybe when I've seen it more clearly and let that part go, maybe there's some direct work to do also."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But having that awareness that some of it can work itself out is so important on the path and creates so much more spaciousness for us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's kind of how the Dharma works."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "We get more in tune with the Dharma of being able to do that for us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So if your tendency is to sort of actively work on parts of the mind, you might consider this somewhat simpler approach, either just dropping things and returning to the breath again and again without judgment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Or even holding something in a space of awareness that's strong enough to hold it and kind of letting itself play itself out can be really a helpful approach."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Now there is, of course, a structure to the path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's not that it's all just open and there's no, of course, the Buddha had many, many teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "In particular, he taught the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So we do get a series of steps that are worth learning, knowing that the path is going to include these eight things, about our view, our intention, our speech, our action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And all of those factors will be developed as we proceed along the path, as we transform the mind in the way that it can through practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I do encourage learning this structure."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I'm also a big fan of asking people to read the sutras and the original discourses of the Buddha as part of the practice in order to understand the main principles that he was teaching."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But this is pointing now toward another subtle attitude that I want to highlight on the path, another way that we think we're kind of in control or managing our own path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that is that we can get attached also to that structure."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there are also people who spend a lot of time reading Dharma books or even reading the sutras and learning all the principles and trying very hard to match their experience up to what they have heard or read."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And this one is subtle because you do need to listen to the Dharma like we are today and you do need to learn something about what the main points are that the Buddha was making about things that we need to cultivate and things that we'll be letting go along the path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And yet, we don't want to take that up as kind of an abstract theoretical model that we then impose onto our experience because our experience just is what it is."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so if we're subtly applying these ideas to them, we are again in a very subtle way controlling it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "If we have an idea, let's see, I'm supposed to look for which part of effort I'm working on right now."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Let's see, which are the four aspects of effort is relevant right now."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "In a way, while we're doing that, we're not fully taking in the experience of the moment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we're subtly also seeing certain parts of experience and ignoring other parts that we don't think fit what our idea of the path is because until we're awake, we can only have an idea of exactly what it is that we're doing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so there's a way in which our theoretical ideas also act as barriers toward actually walking the path, actually engaging the experience and finding our freedom within it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So this is not at all to discourage study and that kind of thing any more than I am discouraging working on and understanding our difficulties, but just to know that there are attitudes around that that can hinder the way that we are able to be free in experience."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "One good news about the Eightfold Path is that it's very, the more I work with it, the more impressed I am that it has a way of undermining identifications that by actually following the steps of the path as they're laid out."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Here's what right view entails."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Here's what right intention entails and aiming to do that in our own experience."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Everything will be undermined."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It will undermine even itself."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So in a way, the Eightfold Path is a process that undoes even identification with the path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's this balance in watching the mind for its tendency to want to control and manipulate and theorize, and then also with this sense of being open and easeful and letting things unfold as they are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So the beginning of the verse from Sikula, remember it goes like this, if there is something in these teachings calling out to you, it's because there's something in you calling out to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So this is another way of considering our relationship to the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So this is yet another means of connecting, of interfacing with our practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So here you are right now listening to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Is there something in you that has drawn you here this morning? Is there something in you that is calling out to attend a sit and a Dharma talk? Maybe just taking a moment to feel what it is in you that brought you here today."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then equally so, can you hear something calling out to you? Is there something in these teachings that is calling out to you? So what is this resonance between the teachings and your heart? Is there some sense of resonance there? In the recent IRC retreat, Paul Haller was talking about the invitation of the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That was the phrase he used, and it really caught my attention."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Far shore is a poetic term for the goal of Buddhist practice, which is the end of greed, hatred, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's called the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So it's not so much that that is a different place, far removed from here, but it's more that we're often not focused on it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "What we're focused on is kind of all the stuff that's right in front of us and is occupying our attention, and that's collectively in Buddhism called the near shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then there's the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So when the near shore is in focus, when we're really focused on all of those things that keep us busy, we're not focused on the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's in our far, far field vision in a sense."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It does invite us, doesn't it? So even when we're here on the near shore and we're taking care of our lives, there's an invitation in each moment from the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that can help, in a way, take us deeper into ourselves, deeper into this moment, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So discerning this call, whether we're discerning the invitation or the call from the far shore, or whether we're discerning what in our own heart is calling out toward that, we would need to listen."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "We need to listen in order to hear that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So I call this contemplation."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "The word contemplate can include kind of a sense of combining listening for this invitation and an internal contemplation of what is wanting to be offered or what is wanting to come forth from the heart."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So in a way, we invite the Dharma as well as the Dharma inviting us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And are we in tune with what that is for us right now? So relating to the teachings can get very intimate."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's something that we each have to discern for ourselves, and it will change, of course, all along our path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So it's maybe different at the beginning, and then farther along, and then even farther along, there's a way in which how we're relating to the teachings is coming forth differently in our heart."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's maybe a beautiful phrase about that that we could contemplate, which is the traditional refuge is in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we might consider, is there a way in which we feel like the Buddha is in our own heart right here? And is there a way in which we feel that the Dharma is something that is flowing through our veins, nourishing all the cells of the body? And is there a way in which the Sangha is not something outside that we're relating to, but that the Sangha can never be separated from us? It's sort of a part of us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "The whole Sangha is contained just within this being."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And considering in this way, it's as if refuge is woven into our very being."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "This is something that we can point to maybe during meditation with the breath, the way the breath flows through the whole body, beats with the heart, and unifies everything that's in the body and the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Of course, it's not like this every time we sit, but it can be a sort of a guiding idea in our practice and finding the way in which that resonates for us."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And the way in which, you know, once we have done this enough, kind of saturated ourselves with this sense of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha being in the fiber of our being, then seeing what actions can come forth from that, you know, how we get up from the cushion and talk with people, and how we get up and do our work around the house or for our job."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I would say that when we've done this enough, then that's what it means to be ready for the path to take us just as we are, just as we are, but with the addition of the refuge woven into our being."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we can look, for example, at how long time practitioners practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Mostly, they go along with their life."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But every now and then, they undertake particular practices or trainings of some kind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, you know, I feel like it's time to do a retreat with a particular teacher, or, or a self retreat, or to take a trip to Asia, or to set aside a time for writing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "These things have a way of feeling like they're ripe."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then, and we say, oh yeah, okay, this is time now it's time to do this next thing it's just feels like it's the time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Usually there is some fruit when it really feels like something is ripe and it's the time to do a short retreat or take a class on something."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "There will be some fruit from it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "But sometimes it's surprising."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's one of the hallmarks of the Dharma is that it's a surprise."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we know there's something coming something there but what it actually is, is not anything that we could have thought about."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So truly, we're not in control of this process, but we can sense it as it flows along."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's this balance that we're finding."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And it's really, in some ways only a matter of how deeply we accept that we're not in control."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And yet there is something happening we have a role to play."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, so relax, in a sense, relax and allow the path to unfold."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes it will do so easily."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes not so easily, but it's always going to be unfolding, just how it can."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And this is, this is the life of the Dharma, the continual unfolding of that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, let me read this verse one more time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "When you're looking in these teachings calling out to you, it's because something in you is calling out to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "The path will take you whenever you're ready, just as you are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "You're great, just as you are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "In fact, you're probably on the path, just by being here and sending into your experience as it is."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I hope very much that you find this resonance as often as possible."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes we fall out of it, but when we're in it, there's this sense of resonance between what's calling out from our heart and the call of the far shore, the teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, may your path progress very well and be well."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "If there are any questions or comments, we do have a couple of minutes, and I welcome anything coming into the chat."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Please be aware that I have a delay, and so I won't see it right away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I wanted to ask any questions or make any comments."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I'll see if there's anything else I can say, and otherwise have a wonderful day or evening."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I see a question about the book that I read from."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's called The First Free Women, Poems of the Early Buddhist Nuns, and it's not exactly a translation of the Terigata."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "It's, of course, based on that, but it's more of an interpretation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the heart can relax, maybe the organs deep in the body, the stomach, the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And too, perhaps the mind can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And the mind is not relaxed, caught up in mental tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's often caught in past or future and worries concerns."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So can the pull to past or future be softened a little bit? Set aside perhaps for the time being and seeing if there can be an inclination to be here present with the mind and body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And as there may be a little bit of arriving more fully into the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Noticing just to begin with what is obvious, what is naturally being received and experienced."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Let's already hear present available."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It may be body sensation with a breath or sound that's happening in your environment, the sound of my voice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Might be a state of mind or heart."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Whatever is here, mindfulness can be present with it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And what is here, what is obvious may change from moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Undoubtedly will change from moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It is expressing the nature of experience to be changeable."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so one form of mindfulness practice is kind of settling back and just seeing if there can be a receptive, a willingness to receive whatever is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Not needing to direct the attention or choose what mindfulness pays attention to."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "For some, this form of practice, this receptive mindfulness practice, can feel very comfortable, useful."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And if that's the case for you, you're welcome to continue."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just simply being aware of whatever is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And for some, it feels more congenial to land with a particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so for you, if that's the case, it can sometimes feel more supportive for mindfulness to allow the attention to rest with one particular area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Perhaps the breath or body sensations or hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "If that feels more supportive for you, you're welcome to allow the attention to rest with whatever experience feels most comfortable in that way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And I would encourage, if that's your exploration, to explore holding that experience with a receptive mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "If you're landing with the breath, receive the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "No need to make it be a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just how is the breath? How is this breath? Or if sound is what you're attending to, just receiving the sound."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "There's also no need to hold tightly to whatever experience you've chosen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "You may be settling with the breath, for instance, and still aware that hearing is happening, kind of on the periphery, or other body sensations are happening on the periphery."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "In fact, this is sometimes the way mindfulness works as we attune to one area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Others also become illuminated."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So you don't have to try to force other experiences to go away."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just allowing yourself to connect, to experience, and receive what's here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "At times, when I'm practicing, I find the mind gets a little caught in something, trying to do or fix something, wanting to hold on to something."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Not to is just something that's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "We can be simply aware that that's what's obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It feels like there's a little bit of a catch, or tension, or a tightness, a little struggle in the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes I find it helpful, and sometimes it kind of naturally arises."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What's here? A struggle that's arising."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "That reflection in my mind supports a little bit of a letting go of identification, or a letting go that I need to fix it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's more of, oh right, this is just happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So sometimes these little wisdom reflections can create conditions that the mind can then relax, and simply receive, oh there's that tension that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "As opposed to taking it personally, thinking it's something wrong with me, or wrong with what I'm doing, wrong with the meditation, it's just another arising."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Aware of experience, whether more broadly receptive, or connected to a particular experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Receiving, receiving, just as it is, experience as it has come to be."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "It can be helpful to start a sitting by just first checking in how are you in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Just taking, kind of like taking stock of yourself, noticing how the body is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Is there tension or ease in the body? Is the mind caught up in thoughts? Or is it fairly relaxed? It's kind of beginning by arriving with yourself as you are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "This is mindfulness, being aware of how you are in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "No need to judge or try to fix or change anything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "With mindfulness, just opening to, this is how it is right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes, not always, but sometimes that arriving with, aligning with, recognizing this is how it is right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes it can allow the mind to relax a little bit with that simple recognition."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "That's part of how mindfulness and wisdom work."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And while mindfulness is this non-interfering awareness of how things are in this moment, wisdom can choose to act, wisdom can choose to understand, know things, wisdom understands and knows things that support us."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And so wisdom may choose to orient towards some supports for being present, such as relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes we can relax the body consciously checking in and noticing where tension may be held and sometimes it can be released."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And this can support our capacity to be present."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "So you can take a few moments to just scan through your body, maybe noticing places or areas where there might be tension held and see if there can be a softening or relaxing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "There's also sometimes a possibility of orienting to a more internal relaxation of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Not always available, but maybe the inside of the throat can relax, maybe the area around the heart can relax, maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Maybe too, the mind can relax, letting go of thoughts, worries, concerns."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And if that is an odd thing for you to reflect on, your mind gets caught up in what that means, just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "We'll offer an analogy that Gil uses sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "As if the brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And sometimes a way in to relaxing the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Having explored relaxation as a support for being present."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Opening to again, once again, how are you in this moment? It's possible there's been a shift from earlier."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "It's also possible there's more capacity to just align with and hold to be with yourself as you are right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "This is how the mind is right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You can, with mindfulness, explore this receptive quality."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Just allowing the experience to be as it is, changing, shifting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Almost as if the experience of our body and mind is a river just flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You're just in that river flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You don't need to stop the flow to identify anything in particular about just receiving."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes receiving from a broad perspective."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes there will be specific things that kind of highlight a body sensation, emotion, thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Noticing those and then what's next? This is mindfulness in its receptive form."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And for some of you, it can help at times if you're comfortable with this receptive form, you're welcome to continue with that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "For some of you, it may support your capacity to be present, to perhaps narrow the field a little bit of what you're receiving, choosing perhaps the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And then receiving, how is the breath right now? How is the breath flowing through, in and out? And is the mind staying relaxed, receiving either the broader experience or the specific experience? This capacity to be present, be aware of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "It's a natural capacity of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "It functions quite well when we relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And the mind will get caught up in thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You wonder for some period, and at some point, you will remember that moment mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Often we orient to the fact that we have been lost, but can we recognize that this is what it's like to be present now? Mindfulness has returned."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "It's like the light comes on."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "What's being received in that moment? What's here? Again, just taking stock, checking in, how is it right now that mindfulness has returned? If tension has crept back into the system while the mind was wandering, it can be helpful to explore relaxing the body and mind again for a few moments, remembering that supports this capacity to be aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes, in that moment when mindfulness returns, we're not judging the mind, not judging ourselves for the mind having been wandering."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes we can notice that the mind is actually more subtle, more calm, more relaxed than it was before it wandered."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "So can we just receive, take in, how is it in the moment that mindfulness returns? In each moment receiving."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "That is already available to be known."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What I would like to talk about this morning is anxiety in the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And this may seem like a strange topic, but what has happened is that lately I've become very aware of how many people are experiencing anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I've been mentoring this online meditation course and out of 17 students that I've been mentoring every week, I would say over half of them have referred to the fact that they have been anxious or they've been treated for anxiety or that anxiety keeps them from meditating."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's a really significantly large number."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Also, I have family and friends who complain about anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And when I say complain, I don't say that in a denigrating way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I think they really suffer from anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So that's caused me to think about what does this mean? There's certainly cause for concern in terms of reflection about what are the causes of anxiety and why is there so much anxiety in the world."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But it's not really what I want to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What I really want to talk about is what is the experience of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And how can we alleviate suffering? Because that's our goal."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The Four Noble Truths refer to suffering, the causes of suffering, the end of suffering and the path to the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So how can we relate that to what we're living in our everyday life? So that's what I'd like us to consider."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And what I'd like to do is kind of set the stage for how I'd like to think of it as an experience and then open it up and have a broader discussion because this group is really good at that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So what does it mean to be anxious? How does anxiety feel? Really, what is the experience of anxiety? Lately I've asked a lot of people that question and there seem to be some themes that arise."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But mostly people seem to talk about mind states of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "They don't spend very much time talking about how anxiety feels in the body."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "They don't talk about my hands get sweaty, my heart beats, although sometimes they say that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it leads me to think that there are kind of maybe two main flavors of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's the anxiety that has a strong emotional content where there's kind of a wave, a sense of overwhelmingness, and there's the kind of anxiety that is more of a mind state where you're sort of ready, a certain readiness, where the anxiety is looking for what might happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there are kind of two different ways that I'm thinking about it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is not meant to be meant to be exhaustive."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is just my thoughts as they're coming along."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes there seems to be an urge to be better."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "For things to be better, for me to be better, I can't live up to this being better."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's an element of self-judgment that arises, a lot of self-judgment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is not good, I'm not good, I should be better, I can't do, and a fear that will never be good enough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Now all of us have some fears as we go through our lives and some feelings of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I think what people call major anxiety is much larger and there really is kind of an overwhelming feeling to it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Just not good enough, just not able."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Somewhere in the story of anxiety is a feeling of hopelessness, of hopeless incompetency."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I can't prevent this from happening, or I can't control this, or I can't."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's an I can't feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I kind of divided these things up into just three main areas."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So one of them is uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "How we deal with uncertainty and how we experience uncertainty I think leads to some definition within anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's a loss of control with uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "When things are very uncertain, we can't plan our way into them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So holding that uncertainty can be quite difficult."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes self-esteem is tied to the need for control."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If I can't make this happen, I'm bad."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I should be able to do this, and so self-esteem suffers."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "My consciousness that I can't do, I can't do."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it can be quite overwhelming, a sense of responsibility."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What is that kind of funneling in feeling that happens? Sometimes it's a matter of feeling that there are just too many things happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That overwhelming feeling is not so much the largeness of what's happening, is that just too many things happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's no track of all of them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes it has to do with an attachment to outcome."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In order for things to be good, this has to be true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's a kind of setting something up, and if I can't make that happen, then I'm a failure, because that's what needs to happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The outcome is the only really good thing."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If I can't make that happen, it's not good enough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or maybe another side of that is I've set everything up, and it didn't happen so I was wrong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the sense of not being able to control the outcome is experienced that way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And we'll kind of come back to some of these things."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm kind of giving an idea to you of the responses I've gotten from people when I've asked them about anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the interesting ones is that people respond with a sense of paralysis."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's kind of the deer in the headlight feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I've had that feeling that I'm in a situation and all of a sudden I just can't move."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't that I can't even think of anything."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't that I don't know what to do."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's just a total stopping."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Nothing can be done feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I've seen that in some people close to me recently, so it's really strong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a sense of not being safe, of things not being secure."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a kind of unmooring that happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, you're tooling along, everything seems fine."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "All of a sudden it's like you've been hit from behind."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I was recently hit from behind in my car, so I know what this feeling is like."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And all of a sudden all the safety has gone away and you just feel like you've been shifted and everything seems a little shaky again, you know, this unmooring feeling that happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or some major catastrophe happens in your life."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it's kind of a surprise."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And you're moved off your pattern, you're moved off your plan, this unmooring feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes we refer to it as being pulled out of our comfort zone."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, we're moved off where we feel comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's uncertainty, there's paralysis, there's the sense of the unknown, which is a little different than uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The unknown is just not being able to feature what comes before."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's a very human thing to want to move forward."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And not being able to feature it is really difficult."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're afraid of making a mistake."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're afraid of the consequences of our mistakes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We set up a threat barrier."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, humans have evolved to be able to respond to threats."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, that's how we got away from the saber-toothed tigers, right? We set up vigilance."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the amount of vigilance we set up, we sort of equate with security."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So if our vigilance isn't good enough, what happens to security? So there's this sense that I've set up things to work and I'm safe behind this and then the wall is breached and then it's unknown because we've made that wall that place of security."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And now it's been breached."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The unknown can be quite frightening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes it's just a lack of the familiar, you know? I get pretty used to the way I feel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is how it's going, you know? I recently went on a vacation to an island where things were very different than they are here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I was surprised at how much effort it took just to sort of walk down the street."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Everything was unfamiliar."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I didn't know where I was."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I didn't know where to find."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, where's the grocery store? How do I get milk? And all of that sort of edged up the uneasiness in me, you know, the lack of the familiar."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There also seems to be a little piece of loneliness and anxiety where we kind of lose our sense that somebody else is there to help us."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We lose our sense of connection to other people and we feel very isolated."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So maybe isolated is a little better word that kind of shows up when people talk about anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So someone, I have a few quotes here from a friend of mine who's just said some wonderful things lately."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So this is one of Dan's things."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "He says, loneliness is the absence of other and aloneness is the presence of oneself."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I thought, wow, that is really great."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Loneliness is the absence of other and aloneness is the presence of oneself."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Which kind of brings me to the place where we start talking about how can we work with anxiety? How do we experience all of these aspects of anxiety? And what does that mean as we try to eliminate suffering in our lives or lessen or ease or make it a little less with us? How do we practice with anxiety? So what I would like to suggest is that being with the experience of anxiety, all of these various ways that anxiety manifests itself, has to do with the practice of being with what is true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So when we talk about how do we let go of those things that are causing suffering, we talk about the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the Eightfold Path, it's our prescription for how do we deal with suffering and how do we give up suffering."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And of these eight things, you can kind of divide them into three areas."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One is the wisdom section, and it has to do with right view and right intention."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Right view and right intention."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then there's a section that has to do with more action things."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We have right speech, right action, right livelihood."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then there's the meditation section that has to do with concentration, mindfulness, and right effort."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So if we say those are kind of the tools that we have to work with, what is going to apply to anxiety, to all these feelings of anxiety? What comes up? How do we apply these tools to eliminate suffering, to let go of suffering? So I'm suggesting that one of the places that seems most likely to help is in that wisdom section that has to do with right view."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Are we seeing things? How are we seeing things? And intention."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What is our intention when we see what we see? So in looking at that, I thought there are kind of several things that we can do."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "First we have to notice what comes with the anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It was interesting to me when I asked people how did they know they were anxious? This seemed to be a really difficult question."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "How do you know you're anxious? Well, I'm anxious."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But what is the experience of anxiety? What do you see? What do you feel? Often there's a contraction in anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'll give you an example."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Let me list the four things and then I'll give you an example."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So noticing what causes contraction or defensive postures or the pushing away, whatever the reaction is to the anxiety-causing thing."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What do you do? How do you feel? And what do you do in response? Notice that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The second is willingness to stay with the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I'll have a lot to say about that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Staying in the room, which has to do with not going into the past, not going into the future, not going into plans, but staying in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the fourth one is reflecting on what else is here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So those are the four things that I think might shed some light on anxiety and our experience of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What causes contraction or defensive postures? What's there? The willingness to stay with what is there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Staying in the room so that we don't build up the story about it from the past or what has happened or what might happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And fourth, reflecting on what else is here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So those are the four ways that I'd like to look at this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'll give you a quick example."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This morning I woke up and it was pouring rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I live up by Point Race Station."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it's normally about an hour and a half drive to here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I woke up, it's pouring rain, I'm thinking, okay, rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "First day after a three-day holiday, traffic is going to be miserable on 101."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I decided to leave early and I gave myself two hours and 15 minutes to get here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It seemed pretty generous on an hour and a half trip, right? Well, traffic was crummy."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I realized that I was becoming anxious around this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And how did I know I was becoming anxious? Well, I was doing my usual gripping the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But also I was kind of pulling the steering wheel toward me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I mentioned this gripping the steering wheel in this group a few weeks ago."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I said something about loosening my fingers, loosening my grip from the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And someone was concerned that I'd stopped driving using the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'll tell you what I did was I loosened, I didn't remove my hands from the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And that's when I noticed that I was actually pulling back on the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I was in a hurry to get to where I was going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, there was this feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I thought, well, that's interesting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then I noticed that my jaw was really tight."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So here I am going 20 miles an hour on 280 in pouring rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And there's really a lot of traffic."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the truth is, and my intention is to be on time and to arrive not feeling too jangly."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I have a couple of intentions."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The conditions for what's happening have all been set."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The time I left has already happened."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I cannot affect any of these conditions that are giving rise to my anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What I can affect is how I experience those conditions and what's happening now."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I realized that I could continue trying to think of ways for what was true to not be true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Well, if I'd taken another route, or maybe I should have, or maybe I could scoot over to that lane."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And maybe it's going a little faster over there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or I could worry about, well, what's going to happen when I come in late? They're all going to be sitting there and they're going to wonder, nobody's shown up this morning."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the conditions are not going to change."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So staying with just the conditions as they are, I softened into that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I didn't have to stay with that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I was able to just say, OK, the conditions are the conditions."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I'll either be on time or I won't be on time."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "As it turns out, I was early, so that was great."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But that didn't stop me from being anxious on the way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But it did have a lot to do with what were my intentions for being present with the moment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "How was I reacting to those conditions? Was I willing to stay with the conditions? Was I willing to admit that I was anxious? You know, good Buddhist teacher isn't going to be anxious."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Was I willing to admit that into the car with me and realize that's why my hands were gripping the steering wheel the way they were? OK, so the first one is noticing the willingness to stay with discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The willingness to stay with discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I talked to this absolutely remarkable person last week who was a young man, a physicist in Germany."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And he said, I really had this great experience this week."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And he was someone who told me that he had experienced a lot of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "He said, I was sitting, I was sat down to meditate and I was very anxious and very restless."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I was so restless and I just thought, I'm not going to be able to sit today, I'm too restless."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And so he said, I thought about trying to just stay with it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I started to study the restlessness and I realized that it was just getting bigger."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So then I said to myself, OK, I'm restless."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And he said it was like the earth moved."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "To finally just tell himself he was restless, to admit that he was restless and not have to change the fact that he was restless, was a source of liberation for him."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's a difficult thing to talk about if you haven't actually experienced that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Where you're with something that's uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And everything in you wants to change that what is uncomfortable to something that is comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And to realize that you can be with that need to change it, with that desire to change it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, one of the questions is, is it OK to be uncomfortable? You know, when I'm uncomfortable, the first thing I do is I think about how I'm going to fix it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, my knee is a little tight."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Maybe I'll move it over this way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But very often, I'm sure you've had this experience, when I sit, my alarm clock goes off at 30 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "At 30 minutes, I know the 30 minutes are up."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But what I found is if I look at what is happening in my knee and study what the feel is in the knee and how it's moving and where it's going and the need to change it changes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily go away, but it changes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the next thing I know, I've gone to 45 minutes and I'm wondering how I got to 45 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't gritting your teeth and stuffing yourself through the experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's really just the way you hold the experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The willingness to be with what is uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Now, I'm not talking about something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the things I did on my vacation is I went snorkeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So every time I get into the water, I have to overcome a little bit of fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then I'm in the water for a while and I get soft and I float along and it's going okay."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But there was one time, there was one place that we went in on this vacation where the water was rough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It was very deep immediately and I was really scared."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I realized, and then there was a slight current."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm a very weak swimmer, which is one of the reasons I'm afraid of water."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I realized I was just really scared and that there was a difference between overcoming this fear that is sort of an endemic I'm afraid of water and the fear that had to do with this is unsafe."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is actually unsafe and I got out of the water."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So we're not talking about staying with something that's unsafe or that's going to harm you."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But can you be with what is uncomfortable? What does it feel like to be with what's uncomfortable? I'm not even prescribing that you stay with something that's uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I am suggesting that learning what the experience is can be very useful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "To experience the ability to stay with what's uncomfortable, admit that you're uncomfortable and know what that is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because there is freedom there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There is easing around the tightness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Very often, not wanting to be with something that's uncomfortable is not wanting to be with ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes, so I may find myself in a conversation with someone where it's not going well."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're talking past each other or things are escalating and the energy level is changing and it's uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it's not my intention for it to be that kind of conversation."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I can feel myself getting irritated, maybe developing a little ill will toward this person."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Why are they doing this? Why are they always doing this? I hear the stories start."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then I have to figure out what I'm going to do because ill will is there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Now I don't want it there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I don't want to think of myself as somebody that has those kinds of thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So what do I do? You know, sometimes we think that if we admit something is present, if I admit I'm angry, that it's just going to get bigger because I'm going to feed it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But admitting that it's there does not mean that I'm going to feed it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Admitting that I'm fearful about something doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to feed it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I can feed it by telling myself stories."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I can say, oh, this always happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is going to happen in the future."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That puts energy into that experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But just saying the current experience right here in this room, that's different."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's useful to learn the difference."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So we accept that we're uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're not encouraging or discouraging it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And when we do that, we're free to discover something else about it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What this person from Germany told me is that he found a softening, an easing around the discomfort of the restlessness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It was really magnificent to discover that he could be restless and not need to change it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That that amount of easing was really interesting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This kind of learning encourages to think about where we fight our battles."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If we were going to be perfect, we would be very busy."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Just about everything that arises would have us having to do something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the things I'm learning is when to just stop."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In the example of a blooming argument or unskillful conversation, I've learned that I can just stop."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In the past, I thought, if you just stop, you have to explain why you're stopping."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You have to tell somebody, well, this isn't going anywhere for me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the truth is you can just stop."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And usually the conversation, which tends to be one-sided at that point, keeps going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You don't have to explain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it doesn't make the ill will go away."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because I've stopped, I'm not putting more energy into the discussion."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the urge to retort or complain still leaves, is still there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then just wait and see what happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It surprises me what happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because my forward movement is so strong, I'm pretty sure I know where it's going to go, and it doesn't."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because I didn't go there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it means giving in the need to be right."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So if I'm in a discussion, I know I'm right."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I could help this person if they just listened to me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The first thing I have to do is give up my need to be right before I can help them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It just doesn't work that way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I had this experience yesterday."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm still regretful that I didn't see that sooner."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That I didn't stop sooner."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I was really trying to help."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But this was a case where intention was not aligned with what was true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What's true? It wasn't going to go there, no matter how hard I was pushing it that direction."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It wasn't going to go there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So another thing that we kind of get stuck on is the lure of the peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Well, if I'm going to be a quantumist, I have to be peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And so we expect everything."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We have this not an expectation so much as an idealism that things should be a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I should be a quantumist, and a quantumist means that I never lose my balance."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So when something comes in that threatens us, if we can't be balanced, we're introducing anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're making it a centerpiece because we have an ideal about how we should be reacting to this occasion."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So that we think that every time we deviate from peacefulness that it's a failure."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Equanimity has to do with seeing what is true and staying with what is true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Not feeding unskillful actions, but also not pushing away what is true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So when we're trying to maintain balance, we find ourselves spending a lot of time getting entangled in fixing, arranging, adjusting, which is feeding that sense of, I'm not good enough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'll never be good enough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then we have a blossoming into this place of self-judgment and anxiety that we're kind of hooked in."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What seems to be true is that we have these well-worn paths that our mind takes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And we're rolling along, rolling along."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Doesn't matter how skillful we are when we hit that rut."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're going to have some adjustments."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "On the other hand, if you're riding a bicycle and you're constantly adjusting, you're going to find yourself not being able to maintain your balance at all."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a certain ease that comes with the balance of knowing how the bike is moving and how your body is on the bike, and you're just going, you don't have to be doing this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "All the present moment is like that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We have a lot of expectations for what we should be doing with our present moment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the most important thing is to see what is actually true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of those things is to stay in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Staying in the room is my shortcut for not going outside and learning about something else."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes I notice when I'm meditating that when I'm restless, I start trying to find the reason for the restlessness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Right here in the room, I'm experiencing restlessness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or I do a lot of work with hospice people, and very often I'll find myself coming into someone's room and saying, oh, this is just like so-and-so."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So-and-so is not in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or I will, I have a tendency toward asthma, which I've spent most of my life pretending was not true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Recently I had pneumonia, and it triggered asthma, pretty bad asthma, and so they put me on prednisone."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I've never taken it before."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It makes me really jangly."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And what I've discovered is it's sometimes difficult, but my usual cues are wrong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because of the pharmacological things that are going on in my body, I'll experience something and I'll say, oh, it's like this, and it's not like this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's actually a function of how agitated the prednisone makes me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It makes me feel like I've had a lot of caffeine."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes it gives you kind of an elevated feeling, and then you look around and realize it's not connected to anything and you crash."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'm finding it very disorienting, and I'm constantly having to ask what's really happening, what's really happening, and staying in the room and not thinking I know what it is outside the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This has a lot to do with staying with what's uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because my husband right now is having a hard time reacting to me, and I'll think, what's wrong with him? And then I remind myself that maybe it isn't him, maybe it's me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I have to stay here in the room with all this uncomfortable feeling that's going on."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And what I do, I have this mental picture of how to stay in the room, and I take this version of the Buddha doesn't have it, but very often you'll see a Buddha statue and Buddha is sitting cross-legged on the ground and he has his hand down."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This symbol is related to the stories around the night of his enlightenment, and in the temptations that he faced during that time."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The final thing he did before his enlightenment is he called on the earth, he touched down and he said, I am here, Mara, which is the version of the tempter."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I am here, I deserve to be here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Mentally, I touch the ground."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "When I'm finding it difficult to stay in the room with whatever is happening, it's just a feeling I have of my hand sort of turning over and touching the ground."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it helps me, it's a mental trick I have for staying in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Don't go out there, stay here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The last thing is what else is here? What else is here? This is kind of related to, if we go back to the prednisone story, okay, I'm feeling little, it's not coffee."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't actually what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What else is happening? And really paying attention to what else is going on."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes, for example, I may feel discomfort of, let's say I have a feeling of discomfort due to feeling inadequate."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "All right, I can't fix this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Somebody wants something from me, I can't really do it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What else is here? Well, I'm a little embarrassed."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I should be able to do this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's some embarrassment here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What else is here? And sometimes I find that whatever my first answer was, while not untrue, it's not quite it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Why is this important? Because the first thing that comes to mind is where the ruts are."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's where your mind typically goes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm in the habit of doing this, right? So hunger is a good example."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm very distrustful of being hungry."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because the question is, what am I really feeding? You know, it's really hard for me to go hungry."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I have a lot of fat stores."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But boy, there are times when I could tell you I'm really starving."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's just a way of feeding something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What am I feeding? What's really happening here? What's going on? Sometimes it's very often a response to anxiety feeding."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I have a strong ice cream habit."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Fortunately, I try not to keep ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But it was noticing that that was my response to anxiety that I found interesting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So there's an intention to be skillful and the drive to be better than we are."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And one is kind of a distortion of the other."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Being skillful does not require us to be other than who we are."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But if we have this ideal that we're leaning toward, instead of what's happening here, it becomes much more difficult."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So another thing that my friend Dan said is he was talking about what it's like to get older."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And he said, because I like myself now, I care less about what others think."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because I like myself now, I care less about what others think."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There are lots of places to get tripped up around that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'm going to read you a poem by Galway Cannell called St."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You've probably heard this poem before, but it seems particularly fitting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The bud stands for all things, even those things that don't flower."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "For everything flowers from within of self-blessing, though sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "To put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch, it is lovely."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Until it flowers again from within of self-blessing."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow and told her in words and in touch, blessings of earth on the sow."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the sow began remembering all down her thick length from the earthen snout all the way through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "From the hard spinyness spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart to the blue milk and dreaminess spurting and shuttering from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The long, perfect loveliness of sow."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Each of us comes to each moment with intentions and goodwill."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Goodwill for ourselves, basically."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The question is whether we can see ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Can we see ourselves? Can we see the moment? Can we see what is true when we don't bring all the other stuff into the room? My experience is when I am directly connected to my experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's really quite lovely and it doesn't seem to matter whether it's pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That being connected to this moment changes everything."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I spoke longer than I intended to."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What are your thoughts? Does this seem relevant to the subject of anxiety? Is there material here to work with? Yes, there's a lot there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The thing that was most striking and helpful to me was the parallels between your discussion of equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In my head, I used the word equilibrium."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a parallel to the practice of meditation for me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You're talking about riding a bicycle or being perfect."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There isn't a perfect meditation."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "When I'm meditating, it's constantly bringing myself back to the present."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The left side of my brain is constantly chattering and supplying me with worries sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I might be under stimulated stimulation, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The equanimity is in the bringing yourself back."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's the parallel that I saw."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's beautiful because it keeps me wanting to keep meditating without judgment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Even though sometimes you go, how did I get here or why did my mind wander off? The more I meditate, the less I try to understand why my mind wandered off."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's what equanimity, a lot of what equanimity seems like."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's just bringing yourself back to the present moment, acceptance of what is right now."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The other thing that I go to is, right now, in the present moment, I'm physically healthy."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm not worried about anything, but I know that at some point my body is going to break down."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What I hope for is that when I can recognize it, I can just say, well, that's just part of the process."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's just going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Not grasp at what medication or what treatment or what surgery."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The thing is, the equanimity around that is, to some extent you want to take the right medication and get the right surgery, but you also need to know when you're just grasping for something that's inevitable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Grasping to prevent something that's inevitable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I think getting towards living at peace with that I'm going to die would be a nice thing to live my life that way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Take, for example, dealing with the unknown, if we can box our experience and pick out different aspects."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes we can search down through certain feelings such as sweaty palms."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Where is there really suffering in sweaty palms? Yet there's a conceptual knowing of this is anxiety, this is rising because of it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You can sometimes find a little bit of space in the unknown of how is this really arising and that can get you a bit of distance from it and recognizing that there's a higher process going on and this isn't necessarily you creating this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Does that make sense at all? I think it makes sense."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What you're saying is, what you notice is the sweaty palms, but you don't necessarily have to go to the place of anxiety around spreading, you don't have to be responsible for the sweaty palms."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The painful experience of this is anxiety or a pain in my stomach right now, for example."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm also a little bit nervous speaking."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I can touch down to the individual experience, studying it a bit more, and there's the component of when it all comes together, it has a pointingly feeling to it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If I shift my awareness more to the direct experience, the narrative which we create is a function of time, where the direct experience is just little points, little sine waves that we're only aware of."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If the awareness shifts to that, you're not as aware of the painful experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the things I've liked to do with painful experience especially, is how bad is this as compared to being on fire or burning? How bad is that really? We treat things like cramps or stress in the back on our shoulders, and we get worked up about this, but if we compare it to some really truly painful experience, and how bad things can really happen, this is silly, this is not worth really getting worked up over, this is really easy compared to really negative experiences, and I can even find joy in that, and get the heart and mind to open up to that experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Even with the contemplation of a corpse, death contemplation, will result in equanimity and future bodily harm."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Yeah, so there are many things that you said there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the really skillful things is to stick with the direct experience rather than the story that is feeding something else."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But you also said that you compared whatever this feeling is to some other experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's actually leaving the room and is tricky."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I think another way of looking at this, because I think what you are doing is quite skillful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So the way that I approach that in a similar situation is I look at it and say, oh, there's this pain, this is a terrible pain, terrible pain, and I recognize that I'm calling it a terrible pain, but that in fact, I'm staying with the pain just fine."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's kind of this assumption, when you go to the place of this is not like being on fire, it's a similar thing you're saying, this pain isn't that great."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm creating how great this pain is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's all created in the mind, and that's what you're doing by that comparison."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I invite you to try to stay in the room with it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Well, the point isn't to run away."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's the manipulation of view."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I think that's a really important point, that a large part of what your experience is dependent on where you look."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So if you are looking at the story, you're much more likely to get caught in the story."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If you're looking at the physical thing that's happening, if you're looking at the direct emotional thing that's happening, you're staying in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a lot going on all the time in every moment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "As I'm sitting here speaking, I'm trying to be reasonable about what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm trying to be darmic about what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm conscious of my arms moving."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm conscious of how I'm sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Pretty soon, the number of things I'm paying attention to can drown out my ability to hear you, to hear my own voice, to be skillful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And where is the primary intention? When I'm here talking to you, my primary intention is not to look good, right? Because if I'm paying attention to that, I'm not going to be able to have this conversation with you."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So all moments have this, where am I putting my attention? You can put your attention on the physical thing, which is a good way to bring yourself in the room."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But you can also be paying attention to what is the attitude of my mind that I'm measuring this experience within."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Am I open to this experience? Am I closed to this experience? Am I afraid of this experience? Now, if I'm looking at that, I'm probably not going to be focusing on what is the physical experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it's both a skill and something to be aware of, that what you are experiencing is determined by where you're looking."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's one of those conditions like the rain and what time I started."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Kim has been waving her hand back here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And Maria, thank you so much."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You're coming so long way and have a great subject we talked about here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And you covered from what to begin with, the anxiety and then how to deal with it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's really helpful here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So the anxiety, it's like it's coming from the fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's fear and it says no self."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It says no self and then why I fear? And then this no self, I had experience of past life vividly."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then going after this body decayed, where this no self is going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I see last past life, the person I was dealing with very closely and I met him here and had, it just convinced me that it's him, exactly him, how he looked, how he had this kind of presence."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "His presence is exactly same that I see last experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then that convinced me this no self, where it's going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I feel like I'm going to carry this same state of me is carrying to the after decayed that if there is next life, go carry one."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So who is this? Well, I have no answer for this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I am aware of, I can only speak from my experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I'm aware of the person that I think I am in this moment and I'm aware of the memory of the person I used to be, where I had constructed this image of self."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "My experience is that what I call myself, how I define myself is a mental construct and that many things are possible and there are physical limitations to what's possible."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the self part, what characterizes this being is largely an accumulation of my past experiences, my opinions, my views, my mental habits."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And that almost anything that I could say about this being, I could say is also not true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So what is it that moves into the next moment? I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Woody Allen once said that he doesn't mind dying."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "He just doesn't want to be there for it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the reason I mention that is that there's a great difference between anxiety, pain and suffering around are you going to be next online somewhere and facing your own death and many things in between."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "A lot of experiences bring with them huge amounts of suffering in the body and as somebody pointed out there's practice necessary to live with that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But also certain kinds of anxiety require that you, before you do anything, that you calm yourself, calm down so that you can see and see clearly."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And that's very hard, especially when it's a chronic situation going on for a long time because the pain and inflammation, the physicality of the body is enormous."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The suffering in it can easily overwhelm the mind without a lot of training and a lot of care."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You're absolutely correct."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the reasons I chose some of the examples I did was in an effort to develop habits of experiencing in situations that are not so threatening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If the first time you try to stay with something uncomfortable is when you're staying with just being in the middle of an automobile accident, that's going to be tough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "One of the things that I said earlier was that I was coming to grips with the fact that I actually do suffer from asthma."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And one of the reasons I've been so reluctant to admit that is that I've been unwilling to face that there's some likelihood that my life will end with my inability to breathe."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm sure it's tied up with why I have trouble snorkeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I practice going snorkeling to overcome my fear of not being able to breathe."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I spent the last afternoon of someone's life with her where she was dying of lung cancer."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And she was much braver than I was."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It was a really amazing experience for me to be with her."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "She kept saying, please help me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And there was nothing I could do for her but be with her and stay with her through something that was truly excruciating, excruciating."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I remember taking some deep breaths and letting them out slowly and she said, stop that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I will never forget holding her body against mine and just being with her inability to breathe."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I hope that that will be useful to me someday."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't easy to face one's own death because whatever we think about self and rebirth, the ego is really strong and the desire to be is very strong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the physical pain that goes with the way some people die is not to be trivialized."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or the mental pain not to be trivialized."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Or the anxiety that arises with, I could die at any minute, people who have heart disease."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "After you've had a heart attack, everything changes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But living with that anxiety also changes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "If you have constant reminders, degenerative diseases like MS or Lou Gehrig's disease or any number of other things, living with that kind of uncertainty with a known certain end is extremely difficult."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The wisdom of practicing to make those mind habits, to grow the mind habits that makes that possible, guides me, encourages me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's very hard to live with the anxiety of a degenerating body."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's difficult to get old sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But it's better than the alternative, they say."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So thank you all for this consideration."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "May you all be happy in the present moment and well."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "The topic for tonight came because there was a question, a practice question, submitted on the Google form that I put on the link for this event."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it's a question about continuity of awareness in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And the person references a kind of practice that I often teach with practicing with awareness in daily life and mentioned some struggles there."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But what I'd like to do to start is to just describe a little bit the practice that the person is referring to in the question."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So there's some context for what the response is."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And also, maybe you'll find this description interesting."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It connects a little bit to what I suggested in the guided meditation, recognizing when awareness returns."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So this is a practice for daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "For myself in daily life, and I find often for a lot of people in practicing in daily life, telling people to try to be mindful all day long is just, you know, not going to work."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "People have a lot to do a lot of other things on their mind, a lot of things they need to engage with."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And trying to carry mindfulness along with you through everything you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Often, it just feels like you're carrying around this heavy weight, and it just doesn't feel like it happens."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So I've, in my own practice, one of the key explorations I've made around daily life practice is to be curious about when awareness does arise in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So just that familiarity of seeing awareness return, it actually happens a lot to us in our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "There's a kind of a way that when awareness returns, sometimes we don't consciously notice it because we're so quick to jump on what awareness has kind of taken in and start processing it or doing something with it."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Because generally we're more interested in what awareness is aware of than we are in being aware, in recognizing that we have become aware."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that habit, often when we become aware, again, after we've been lost, very quickly, you know, like we're sitting at a stoplight kind of spacing out and, you know, and then the light turns and we become aware of that."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And we don't really consciously recognize, I've become aware because we're almost immediately knowing red light."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so it's like the return of awareness gets submerged."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So this is, this is kind of an invitation to just see if you can begin to be interested in those moments when awareness returns in your daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It happens a lot, as I said a minute ago, it happens a lot in our daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And if you can begin to get attuned to it to notice when it happens, and you may not notice it very much at first, you know, it might be three or four times a day you might notice, oh, awareness is back."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And in that moment, again, just kind of taking in what's it like to be aware now."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "What is awareness easily knowing in that moment? So it might be a body sensation, it might be sounds, it might be sight, it might be a thought, it might be an emotion or mood, it might be what somebody's saying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It could be the like, for instance, sometimes I find when I'm out walking, if I'm kind of lost in my thoughts when I'm walking."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "If something unusual happens in my field of vision, like a car goes by, or, or there's some kind of change."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "A little kid kind of pops out into my field of vision."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "There is this kind of waking up and it's like the mind-oriented to seeing in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's like the change of the visual field will kind of trigger the awareness to return."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that moment, you know, that the awareness has returned with something."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So just, just be curious about that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Just the noticing of, oh, I'm mindful here."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And in the simplest of ways in that moment, take in how you are in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "This is what awareness is aware of."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And maybe just a simple, simple of, well, there's ease or there's tension, just that much."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And then what I often suggest, and this sounds counterintuitive for a mindfulness teacher, get on with your day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Don't try to hold on to that mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Don't try to keep the mindfulness going in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now, sometimes it might be able to last a little while."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it might be like when I'm taking walks, for instance, it's like mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it can hang out for a while because I'm not particularly doing much else than walking."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so it's pretty easy to be present when I'm walking."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And I remember, oh yeah, I can be present while I'm walking."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But often, you know, we will have mindfulness return in the midst of some activity."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Like, you know, we're engaged with something, a conversation with somebody, or we're doing something kind of focused on our computer."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And, you know, we recognize, oh, I need to go get this thing."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And then for a split second, we recognize, oh, I'm aware now."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And just take in that moment of now I know that I'm aware."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "The more we can attune to that moment of mindfulness returning in our daily lives, the more we will notice it happening."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's like the mindfulness begins to get familiar with that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Mindfulness begins to get familiar with that experience of mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And because it happens so much through our day, where it's a little bit just below the surface of our conscious awareness, it's almost like that attunement to that experience of awareness returning begins to connect with the subtler times when awareness returns."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's like the horizon of our subconscious, you know, the horizon of the ability to be aware of something gets more and more sensitive."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So we start to see more of those moments."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So you can start with this kind of practice in a simple way, a light touch, you know, not trying to hold on to mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So when I offer this as a practice, this recognizing the return of mindfulness as a practice, I often connected or say it's kind of a practice of intention."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, you just remember at the beginning of the day, or maybe three or four times through the day, you know, you might recognize or remember, wow, I haven't been noticing much mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Well, in that moment, you're probably noticing that mindfulness has returned."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But then in that moment, then recommit."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I'm just going to keep trying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, I'm just going to keep trying to recognize when mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it's not a trying that we're like trying to hold on to it or reach out or try to find those moments because we can't find those moments."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "They happen spontaneously."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so the intention is to be there when those spontaneous gifts arise, when those moments of mindfulness arise."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So the intention isn't to try to hold on or to like keep the mindfulness going, but just to recognize those moments of mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So the intention is just to remember several times a day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Remember several times a day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Just remind yourself, well, it doesn't seem like I've been seeing too many of those, but just keep trying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, just kind of a little pat yourself on the back."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's okay, just keep trying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that intention of remembering that it's something you're interested in exploring, it doesn't have to be something that you're remembering constantly through the day, but just a few times a day remembering this is something that I'm interested in exploring."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "That intention will support you to remember occasionally."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And that's my experience with offering this practice in daily life, doing it myself in daily life, is that, you know, at first in the exploration of this, it only happens occasionally."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But if you keep that intention, there are more and more kind of recognitions, more recognitions that mindfulness has returned."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, even if you only notice it four or five times a day, that may be four or five times more of being mindful in your daily life right in the midst of what you're doing than you would have had before."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it does seem to build."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It seems to gain some momentum."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's not necessarily that we get a lot of continuity, but we get more of those moments of mindfulness through our day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it almost begins to build a thread of continuity through our day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Then it feels like over time it begins to feel like mindfulness is never very far away."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's almost just like right at the surface, right there."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So that practice of recognizing the return of mindfulness is something I often offer for daily life practice."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now, the question that was submitted about this practice, I have a question about continuity of awareness practice throughout the day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "When I have the intention to notice whenever awareness returns throughout the day, it feels tight, fueling more grasping and not skillful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So I've relaxed the intention to practice this ongoing study awareness and have been using suffering more as the reminder to practice, letting the intention go the rest of the time."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "However, I know that the Buddha said to practice mindfulness in all postures, sitting, standing, walking, lying down, and I'm trying to reconcile these two approaches and would appreciate any thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So it's true that the continuity of mindfulness has a power to reveal a lot of what's going on in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "However, that continuity isn't something we can do."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And my experience too is if I'm trying to do that continuity in daily life, it does get tight."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so it sounds like from the person who asked the question, it sounds like the intention to notice awareness returning through the day is trying to be, trying to keep it going through the day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And my guess is because there are other things that we need to do in the day, that does feel tight because when you have to focus on something else, trying to remember in your mind, I need to be mindful of this, it creates attention in the mind to try to focus on something and try to balance your checkbook while you're remembering to be mindful in every moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's possible to be mindful while you're balancing your checkbook, but generally that happens when there's a momentum of mindfulness and that mindfulness is easily coming, not when we're trying to remember it."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So that's the distinction here."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so the encouragement with practicing with this, just noticing mindfulness returning is not to try to hold onto it, as I was describing just a few minutes ago, but just notice when it does return and then get on with your day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So let go of trying to be continuously mindful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now, what this person says is that just letting suffering be the reminder, that's a great practice, that's a fabulous practice, that's one that works for me too."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "In fact, it's like that's one of my biggest mindfulness bells is if there's any kind of suffering, mindfulness is right there."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that's kind of recognizing mindfulness arising with some kind of struggle or stress or suffering."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And when that happens, having mindfulness return with it can be very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it sounds like that approach for the person who asked the question is allowing there to be more ease with recognizing mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "They're not trying to hold onto the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "They're just allowing the return of mindfulness with suffering to be what they let be their mindfulness bell, essentially."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So one thing I would generally say is if a particular practice is creating tension or stress in the mind, it's not generally a useful practice."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now, for you in that moment, because of how you're engaging with it, if you're trying to engage with mindfulness of breathing while you're doing activity, I have been able to do that at times, but again, only when it's been almost like just right there, just an easeful connection with the breath that's so light I don't have to work at it while I'm doing something else."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But if you feel like you have to connect with the breath and remember the breath while you're trying to do something else, you're going to feel that tension."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so if you're feeling a tension in how you're practicing, I would say, yes, put down that practice and find a more easeful practice."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But check in here as the person's doing in this question."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I think that there's a misunderstanding about the way that connecting to the intention to notice awareness returning throughout the day was understood."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So to have that be much lighter, not to try to keep it going."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And for myself, reconciling the idea that I'm not going to be able to practice mindfulness continuously throughout the day with the encouragement to practice mindfulness continuously throughout the day is really just a matter of kind of like reality for me in a way."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Like I have seen that trying to, so exactly what I described a moment ago, trying to continuously remember mindfulness throughout my day while I'm engaged with some other things has been stressful for the mind."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so using this other approach of noticing mindfulness returning has given me more capacity to recognize mindfulness in many different situations created more conditions in which I can be mindful in the day without that tension in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So for me, especially in daily life, I don't put too much pressure on myself to try to be continuously mindful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now when I go on retreat, that's another story."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "When I go on retreat, I wouldn't say I put pressure on myself, but my whole job when I'm on retreat is to cultivate mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "That's what I'm doing in that situation."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And there are times in our daily lives, like for instance when we're driving or doing our taxes or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "If we have a deadline, something needs to get done."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now it might be that we could prioritize awareness in our daily lives too."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And yet what I've seen in my own life is when I come up against a deadline, and it's like I need to get this done by this time, because being aware continuously does slow down what we're doing in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "If it's not an easeful or if it's not that the mindfulness is infusing what we're doing easefully, which is possible."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I've seen in the midst of computer programming, I've seen mindfulness arise and hang out for a little while."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And I've been amazed that even in this very intensely focused activity, mindfulness can arise."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I couldn't have done that while focused on that computer programming, because it would have kind of gotten in the way of all of the things that the mind was having to hold together to do that activity."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So there's this interesting paradox that yes, mindfulness can enter any activity, but sometimes in order to really see it in a natural way, and that's what I'm pointing to here, is like seeing what's happening throughout our day in a natural way, not through, okay, I'm going to try to be mindful of every single movement, which makes things a little bit, it can make things a little bit less natural."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Sayada Utejenia has a phrase, when awareness becomes natural, and that's when there is this momentum of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And awareness can, I like this word infuse, awareness can just infuse whatever we're doing and be very present for whatever we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But that's a momentum of mindfulness that develops over time."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And my own experience is that this cultivation of recognizing these moments of mindfulness returning begins to get that ball of the momentum of mindfulness rolling so that we can begin to see mindfulness in the midst of something more focused or intensive."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So yeah, I think I'll stop there and see if there's any comments or questions or reflections about this topic."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Oh wait, there's one more piece I want to say."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "There's some other daily life practices that can be really useful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "We talked about the one noticing when suffering arises."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Another one that can be really useful as a way to begin to get the juices going in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "One that I used at the very beginning of my practice was if there's something happening in your life that's really interesting to you to get to know more about, to learn more about."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So at the beginning of my practice, I was really struggling with anger and I was very motivated to learn something about how anger worked in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so I chose noticing when anger arose as my project, as my thing I wanted to notice in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I didn't worry too much about being mindful at other times."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's just like I wanted to be there when anger arose."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that's another way in to mindfulness in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Pick something that is interesting for you or you want to learn something about and let that be kind of your intention or your focus for the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's serving a similar purpose to kind of like noticing when mindfulness returns throughout the day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's just kind of the intention to recognize when mindfulness is returning in connection with a particular thing."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And the person in the question found that noticing mindfulness arising with suffering was easy."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that's great, you know, that's fine to use to use that."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "After I took your daily life retreat last time, I made myself some little cards and just am I aware? And I placed those just around as reminders."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "How did it work for you? I'm sorry? How did it work for you? It works fine."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "What I found with those kind of reminders and I've used those two in my in my house, I find I have to move them."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Like, you know, you can't leave them in the same spot because at some point you stop seeing it."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So they become part of the furniture."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Or, you know, even different colors or something that makes it different, you know, you need to change it up a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Did I have these Apple AirPods? I'm not sure how."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Cause even with just one, one in one a year."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, this topic really exploded for me."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I mean, I was so excited to talk about how Goldstein's voice was in my head a lot, you know, talking about awareness, but one thing that you said struck me, you know, going on retreat."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And, you know, made me think of retreat as kind of a, you know, a very controlled environment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But even a daily, you know, your daily sit or my daily sit."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "is that controlled environment where just the simple act of noticing coming back, the basic instruction, noticing coming back to your anchor, to the anchor, is kind of like a microcosm of that daily life practice of kind of coming back to noticing when mindfulness arises."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But one question I had, I guess, was what are things that can condition kind of the arising of mindfulness in daily life? I know, obviously, it's not, we don't do it, but what are the things in daily life that may condition mindfulness or awareness to arise? Well, I think one of the key things is having that intention to notice when it does arise."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "That, for me, was so crucial just to kind of just recognize, yeah, I would remember when I first started this kind of practice, I would remember at lunchtime, I'd be making lunch, it's like, wow, I haven't noticed mindfulness returning at all this morning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And I was like, that's okay, I'm just gonna keep trying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So that intention somehow kind of seeds the mind to connect with it, returning more."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And then there are other things that you'll notice in your own experience."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Each person has their own kind of conditioning where we will have mindfulness return based on kind of our lives, our life's conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And for me, it tends to be when things are unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I wake up when things are unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so it's very interesting to me to have recognized that."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It wouldn't be what I would have thought."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So the arising of suffering is one thing that does wake me up too."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "I also noticed, as I mentioned earlier, like change in the environment will wake me up."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "If I'm sitting and suddenly the phone rings, if I'm kind of like involved in something and suddenly the phone rings, it's like, yes, mindfulness will return there."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So something startling the mind will have mindfulness return."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So there's a lot of different conditions."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And this is something that exploring this noticing of mindfulness returning helps us to recognize the various things that do condition mindfulness to return."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "In terms of the whole, there's some wholesome qualities that condition mindfulness to return in."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Careful attention is what the Buddha says."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Yonisou Manasikara is the wise attention is the condition for mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it's kind of like mindfulness conditions mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so the more we recognize mindfulness, the more we condition the future arising of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "That's actually how it all unfolds."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so the intention for me, the intention to be curious about it is the first, you know, the first step almost, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can you hear me? I kind of feel like continuing just to meditate with you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes, so the topic, I shouldn't start with meditation, I can't talk after that, I just feel like going on and on."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Come on, get into it, they want you to talk."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay, so the topic I would like to discuss with you today is this whole thing about how do we balance our own practice with our concern for others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "What is the value to be given to these two aspects and how do we interrelate them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And for that I am basing myself mainly on the simile of the acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so I am using this topic also to introduce you, to give you a little flavor of my main academic work, which is the comparative study of early discourses."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Early discourses means we have the discourses in Pali, which you are probably familiar."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But these discourses also have, from a different transmission lineage, we have them in Chinese, the Chinese Agamas."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And besides these Chinese Agamas, in several cases we also have some Sanskrit fragments and at times also versions in Tibetan."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And what my main academic work is to compare these different versions, because they come from different transmission lineages, to find the differences and the similarities between them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because it is this type of academic comparative study, which gives us access to the very earliest stages of Buddhist literature."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the type of text, the only type of text actually, that can make a real claim of going back all the way to the Buddha, besides the rules in the Vinaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so to give you a little flavor of that, we look at this acrobat simile in the different versions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Don't worry, I am not giving you the Chinese or the Tibetan, we have it all in English."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And after that, in the second topic we will look at the significance of this simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In the third, we look at some other similes, and then finally I try to relate that to mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So in the case of this acrobat simile, we have three different versions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "One is the Siddhika Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Then we have a Chinese parallel in the Samyutta Agana."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then we have a third one, this is in the Moolasavastivada Vinaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have a full version in the Chinese translation of this, in the Baisajavastu, and also a short quote in the Tibetan."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The third one, we will leave it out for the time being, because number two and number three belong to the same school, they are both Moolasavastivada."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We just look at the discourse version, number one, the terravada version, and number two, the Moolasavastivada version."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So what I have done is, I am always giving you the text, first the Pali version in italics, and then the Chinese version in normal script."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So we just read through this, and then we talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just give you time to read."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So it's basically the same text we have here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "On top you have the Pali version, below you have the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And one noticeable difference we find is about the location."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In the Pali version, the town of Siddhika is located among the sumpas."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In the Chinese version, we are told it's among the Kosolans."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we also get the additional information that it was on an Indian rosewood grove."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is very typical when we get in comparative studies, that there are differences about locations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it kind of shows that for those who transmit the discourse, what was really important for them was the actual message given."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And whether it took place in San Jose or in San Francisco, that was not really so important for them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So sometimes we very often get these differences in the locations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I think you're already getting a little bit of this feeling of how close they are, but still there are these slight little differences somehow."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We are dealing with an oral transmission."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At the old times there were no computers, no books, no nothing."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If we would be at the Buddhist town, now we're giving you a talk, then anything you can take with you is just what you can keep in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And Buddhist monks were not trained like the Vedic reciters."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They tried their very best to pass the message on, but slight changes are almost unavoidable."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In the Pali version we get the name of this apprentice, Meda Katalika."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the feminine ending makes it quite clear that this should be a lady."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The Pali commentary then gets into a very strange argument trying to change her into a male, which I do not find very convincing."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, that's the main difference here I think."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This whole part is not found in the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's also something we get often that one version is somewhat more detailed than the other."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The only thing that I don't really understand is if they have something to discuss why she already gets up on her shoulders, it's a little bit uncomfortable to discuss, I think."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "One major difference is just that we get a little bit more detailed description of how the discussion between the two starts."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Again, the formulation is slightly different, but we get this basic thing that the teacher says to the apprentice or the assistant, I look after you, you look after me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In this way we can do our acrobat display in a nice way and we get whatever people then I assume people would be standing around and then throwing coins or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This part really strikes me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "No teacher, you're getting it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The basic point our Medi-Catalica is making is that I'm not going to look after you, you're not going to look after me, but each of us is looking after himself, after herself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the part that got me interested into this sutta."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's one difference that in the Pali version the Buddha is the speaker and in the Chinese version it's the teacher, but there's a basic difference in evaluation here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The Buddha agrees that the apprentice is right and the teacher is wrong, but in the Chinese version the teacher says, yes, you're right, but actually that's what I was saying all along."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We'll come back to that later."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So here we notice that the Pali version already brings in my translation of Satipata, Establishments of Mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The Chinese version brings them in later, so it's not a difference in meaning, it's just a difference in emphasis."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And both give us this message that there's protection of oneself and protection of others is in some way interrelated."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If I look after myself, I thereby look after others, if I look after others, I thereby look after myself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We'll discuss that later what that could mean."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Here in the Pali version we are not really told what it is that is to be pursued and developed and cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I think it's Asevanaya, Bhavanaya, Bahulika Meen."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And fortunately the Chinese version spells out the obvious is the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And in the Chinese version there seems to be a loss of text there, but I've put in square brackets there, it's not found."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is a very normal, it's a typical way of teaching we find in the Sutras."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's always this question like, how is this or what is this? Then we get it explained and then there's this final statement, this is what it is."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So my commendation there is quite safe and it just seems to be a loss of text there in the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the Chinese also mentions the attaining of realization."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This explains us how by protecting others we protect ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the basic themes are similar, but what I really like in the Chinese version is this gift, the underlying Indicator would be dana."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "A dana of fearlessness, a dana of non-violence, a dana of harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So again we get the basic message is the same, whether I'm concerned with myself, I'm concerned with others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The key point is mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And in the Pali version we again get this statement that protecting oneself one protects others, protecting others one protects oneself, which we don't have in the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And my translation of the Chinese is very literal."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's true, the force fears of mindfulness, but the meaning is the same as Satipatana, Smriti Upasthana."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the Pali doesn't have a conclusion, it just stops there while the Chinese version has the normal conclusion we always have at the end of the discourse."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The Buddha spoke like this and the monks were usually happy about what they heard."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, that's one exception there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I think it's Mula Parayaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the first Imaji Menaka, they were not happy about what they heard."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, I hope that was not too boring, but I just wanted us to go into this discourse for you to get this feeling of what this academic study of early Buddhism is about, to get a feeling also for the slight differences, but what I personally found in my studies, I have given the book to Gil as a fat book, I studied the whole of the Maji Menaka in the right of all of its power, what really strikes me most actually the similarities, how close they are, the basic message is so similar."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So we can't latch on to the form, but the content is still there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So now we want to look at the significance of this Acrobat Simulim."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, there's somebody in India and he is doing Acrobat Sim."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And here we have two ladies in the West."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The Chinese are particularly famous for their abilities in acrobatics."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's a small thing I would like you to notice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You see those strings? Why do they have those strings there? Exactly, exactly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's a very important point for our understanding of the Acrobat Simulim."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They need those strings to keep the poles in place because as these guys are moving up and down and round, the poles will otherwise be moving around."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Just keep that in mind when we discuss the Simulim."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is from a 5th century tomb in China."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We do not know if there was any connection between this and the Indian Acrobat, but it just fits the Acrobat Simulim so well that I want you to see it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So what's the point of this Simulim? As we already discovered, like this string is there with the Chinese, there's a problem of keeping the pole in place."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So if I have nothing better than this, give me the stick right."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If I am the person at the bottom and on top somebody is moving all the time, then what do I have to do? I always have to balance him out, no? I have to keep my own center and as soon as the fellow up there is going like this, if I don't do anything else, I have to go and keep it in place."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And as he's moving there, I have to go and keep it in place."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the person at the bottom, what she has is actually never stable because that fellow below is all the time moving around, no? So there's this constant interplay between the two."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the whole situation will only work when both of us are really keeping precisely our center, totally centered, always away from the slightest adjustment."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "As I'm up there doing my acrobaty, I feel, whoop, he's moving a little bit there, so I better do like this, whoop, whoop."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the one below is, hey, wait, wait, wait."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The whole time they need to interact in order to continue doing it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And for doing that, the most important thing, what then it is, what? Keep their own center, no? If I'm just looking at the fellow up there and I'm not aware of my own center, the whole thing will collapse."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If the one on top is just looking at the, hey, what's he doing there again, then he'll fall off."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So keeping their own center is really the central thing."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And when the teacher says, I look after you and you look after me, why is he saying that? The teacher's in the safe place, no? If something goes wrong, it's the one on top that falls down."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So he says, really, I'm really going to make care that you don't fall down and you also take care that you don't fall on my head, maybe."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But then we get this reply by the student, which I told you that I found so interesting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The way the teacher had formulated the whole thing, it sounded like not that the student feels like, hey, but for this whole thing to work, I have to first keep my own center, you've got to keep your own center."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If we're too much concerned about each other, that won't work."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's a very important point she's making here for us."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If we don't keep our own center, how are we going to help others? Isn't it? They are distressed again for you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then this remarkable difference in evaluation, where in one we are told the Buddha approves, and we get the impression that the apprentice knows it better than the teacher, which is a little bit surprising because if they're introduced as the teacher and the apprentice, we would kind of expect the teacher knows the stuff better than the student."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is what always struck me about this similarly when I was reading the Pali version."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And here, I mean, I feel more comfortable with the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is from the whole logic, it seems more meaningful, this part, that the teacher says, yes, you're right, we have to protect ourselves, but this is what I all the time had in mind anyway."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But as far as interpretation is concerned, the basic message we get is the same."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't change the meaning of the acrobat simile itself, but to my personal feeling, it just runs much more smoothly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At this point, I want to briefly stop and see if there's any questions or comments on this acrobat simile, because that is what I had in mind on this particular simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And after that, we're going to look at some other similes, and then I also need your cooperation to interpret these."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have been talking for quite some time now, and it would be nice if we become a little bit more interactive."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's actually the way I like to."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Usually, when I go somewhere to give talks, the idea is always like, what can I learn today from you? And so it's very lovely."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can you speak to fearlessness and what is meant by that word in that sutta? If we give the gift of fearlessness, for example, if we keep precepts, then I am giving other beings that safety, that I'm not going to kill them, I'm not going to steal from them, I'm not going to lie to them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Or like as a monk, any woman that interrelates with me, she gets that grant, this man is not going to be after you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That really eases the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's not this kind of tension below, we don't know what's going to be happening."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that is a real gift, actually."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It makes relationships very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, those who have the mic have to do a lot of jogging when they are doing with me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This sutta that you just read seems to perhaps explain principles of karma."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If I lose my center, I might do things that are harmful or speak unskillfully."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And if you aren't centered, then I'll be throwing you off, pushing your buttons."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And you might get angry back at me, and it goes back and forth, back and forth."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But if I can keep my center, I'll be careful in my speech, and you'll feel safe with me, and that'll calm everything down, and you'll be more centered as a result."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, very nice, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If you already learned something, let me just digest it, very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I hadn't thought of it actually, well done."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There was somebody up here, and then I come to you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's clear to me that this relates to our relationship with other people, and is it possible, it must happen sometimes, that you are trying to honestly relate to another person, and it appears to me that I, so suppose I'm on the bottom, I try to be self-centered, but for whatever reason, it appears to me that the other person is going to fall, do things, maybe not keeping that person's center, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can you say something about if the acrobat comes upon someone who he or she just can't work with, because it's not working? Then what do we do? You have my questions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I give the question to you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Anybody can comment on this? What do we do with somebody who can't do acrobatcy with us, who can't keep the center? Just the only question that replies to this one now, please."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Oh, I find the meaning of the fact that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Actually, it sort of relates to a question too, and I've read the difference in how to protect yourself and how to protect others as a difference in a practice of wisdom or mindfulness within oneself, that's the cultivating, developing, attaining realization, and a compassion practice toward others, just keeping the precepts, patience, harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If someone isn't a very good acrobat, we have to be patient, and we have to be compassionate."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Somebody at the back there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Well, what comes to mind for me is the notion of mindfulness in everyday living, that we can practice mindfulness in a retreat a lot easier and maintain that mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In everyday life, we're encountering all sorts of variations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's much more challenging, isn't it? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But that's the testing ground."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's the testing ground."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The nice placing on the retreat is not the only way to bring us forward."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have to test it out in everyday practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then we see where we really stand."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At the back there, the lady."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Oh, she's going to get two mics."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I don't need any really, but I was thinking of a question that I had when you asked your question, sorry, about protecting the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I couldn't imagine what that meant."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I can imagine protecting my body, but then to think of protecting the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I couldn't imagine how to do that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Then when you asked your question, I thought, oh, maybe that's the answer to his question."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That can I protect my mind in a situation like that by saying, oh, well, they're not a good acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And not extend, overextend, lose my own balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's a very good beginning."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We will come back to the protection thing."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's a very good beginning in me there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I really like the point of making sure that I don't lose my own balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So we have the patient's thing, definitely."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But there's also the point of up to what point I can be patient without losing my own center."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes? The mic is coming from back."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So along those lines, for me, I keep coming back to the difference of positions with the acrobat and the teacher who's holding the acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And as you demonstrated, the teacher is actually in constant response to the acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so in a way, when she says, oh, you've got it all wrong, we have to focus on ourselves, well, that's really her role as the person kind of leading the movement, whereas he says, oh, yeah, that's what I meant all along, even though originally he sounded like he was just talking about him protecting her, but he's actually the one in response to her constantly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So it seems, even though it's a symbiotic relationship, they're in very different positions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so then they kind of approach it in a different way as well."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I have a very good point."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I was kind of thinking about the same ideas, but slightly different perspective."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The teacher says this is correct and is also the meaning of what I said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And yet if we look at it literally, it's not at all what he said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He said one thing, you look after me and I'll look after you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And she said, no, I look after myself and you look after yourself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the Chinese version is kind of interesting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Is that an odd translation or what does that mean? Or is the teacher just trying to be right because he's the teacher? That's what I said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So my thought was when I was watching you kind of move this around and talking about the teacher's balance and the acrobats balance as two separate things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And also it occurs to me that there's really only one balance there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Both of them have to create it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the idea of myself and yourself, I protect myself, you protect yourself or vice versa, sort of loses meaning in the sense that neither can simply have their own balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They have to have a communal balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So slightly different, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But just to add to the Chinese, I think the teacher is just saying that in order for me to protect you, I anyway have to keep my own balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is the meaning of what I said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That is the, when the teacher says, let me just go back to there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Where is that? Yeah, this is the lower one."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "When he says, as you said, we'll take care to protect ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is also the meaning of what I said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "What he means with that is it's obvious because I have to be centered myself in order to be able to protect you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That is the way how I read the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The point you make is perfectly fine that in the end, whether it's me or the other, there's this symbiotic relationship."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But the Chinese is not odd."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I can't, in this Acrobat situation, I cannot look after the other without looking after myself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The teacher thinks that this is implicit in the whole situation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's the point the Chinese makes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But we don't know, from what the teacher originally said, we can only add that implicitness to that statement."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It comes out of the logic of the similar leaf quite clearly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Just on that point, it strikes me that the teacher has described sort of the end goal."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the student is kind of amplifying their understanding of how they need to go about it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It feels to me that an important consideration is, before the student climbs up the pole, there has to be some sort of understanding of limitations of oneself, of one's own fears of climbing up the pole, one's own ability to balance on the pole, to hold the pole, to develop that trust, to have that communication before we even start to get to that level."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There was somebody just close by, I think."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "No? Any more comments on the acrobat simile, or are we ready? Yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm curious about the symbolism of the pole itself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any comment? Well, it connects them, so it's critical."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So they have to be very careful about the substance of it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So that it supports them, yet it's flexible enough."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any more ideas about the pole? It's so lovely when you all say something and slowly the thing becomes richer and richer and richer."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In my comment, I talked about relating to someone, and of course the relationship occurs mainly through communication."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And maybe this pole is that communication, that we have to pick out a good means of communication."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Otherwise, we're going to have a lousy relationship."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can the mic move down to her? Or is there some other mic close by? This is a little bit away from the pole, but I'm wondering about the whole, the simile in general."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "When I think about acrobats, I think about the training that an acrobat would need to have."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so when using a simile as a tool like this, and acrobats are watched by an audience."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So is this presented as a tool? Do we, as a tool, imagine ourselves all as possible acrobats in mindfulness? Or do you know, it seems so specialized an acrobat trains their whole entire life? So I'm just wondering about that whole perspective of the simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, it's kind of separate from, if we're a room full of people right here, how many of us are an acrobat here in terms of mindfulness like that? Just curious about that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any comments on that? I thought it was quite interesting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any idea of the skill that needs to be developed? In response, I go back to what I noticed the pole might be the communication."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And what you're saying is the acrobats need to train, but we need to train ourselves in communication."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Well, I'm over 70 and I still fall down in ways that I communicate with people."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, my training is not ended."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So as communicators and ones who relate to another, we need to pay attention all our lives to training for that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, I like that training, training in mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We need to be able to see somebody mindfully interrelated with someone else."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We may not climb poles, but I'm sure we all walk tight ropes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I was just thinking that we are always all in relation, you know, in relation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We exist in relationship, so it's not a specialized situation to be."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes, that's very interesting because if we look at the historical context in ancient India, there was this complete withdrawal."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the Buddha did not choose that way."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He emphasized seclusion a lot, but he made it a rule that the monks have to go out for their food."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They're not allowed to keep overnight because he wanted that interaction apparently."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is one typical characteristic of the early Buddhist community, this continuous interaction."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He put it side by side with the fact that mindfulness is really typically Buddhist in the ancient Indian setting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have a very nice connection there, so thank you for that comment."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have a particular appreciation for this story because I'm not an acrobat, but I dance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And to be lifted, which I have very little experience with, but the little experience I have, it gives me the opportunity to hold yourself in such a way that you feel like the person on the bottom is doing all the work, but the person on top has to as well."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm sorry? You were a little fast for me to."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "When you're being lifted, when you dance, the person being lifted also has to hold themselves in such a way to make it easier for the person on the bottom."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's not just the person on the bottom doing all the work."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I can't remember if this was introduced in the text, but there's a huge element of trust."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not only for the person being lifted, but for the person lifting, because if the person on top doesn't hold themselves in such a way and hold onto that center, then you both fall down."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Thank you for sharing this."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The element of trust is very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So when the pole is vertical, the two people are in balance, but that may not last."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the person on bottom has no idea which way the acrobat on top may start to fall, right, left, forward, back."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And when the person does start to lean, the person on bottom has to apply corrective measures very quickly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So you have to be very alert."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So this perhaps could relate to having a very good mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They both have to be quite mindful."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the person below has to feel the pole like an extension of his own center."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so that immediately it starts to move a little bit already."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I feel, oops, I'm out of center and I'm balancing it out again."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because if I wait for too long, it'll be too late."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I won't be able to catch it anymore."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But what came to my mind was a tic-not-han."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You know, you would say, well, this is like this because that is like that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so when there's this, there's that as an opposing reaction immediately."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that everything we think, say, do and feel has an immediate response upon our own organism and the organisms that are surrounding us."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it goes on in an infinite way."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We don't really know how much and that can go into dependent co-arising all these factors."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, that's so what she, if I understand her right, what she's drawing our attention to is that this whole interaction is a very clear demonstration of conditionality, dependent arising, the interaction of the two."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The gentleman at the back."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can we pass on the mic? So there's an imbalance in the list between the two acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The one on the top can go into itself more."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that increases the responsibility of the one below."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's an imbalance of responsibility that's right."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then it says when we both, when we succeed, we both do that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But when we do not succeed, perhaps one pays more than the other."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's still the responsibility."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Somehow it tells me that there's more responsibility with the person who has the more ability, who's more centered."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That is, if all of us don't come to become an acrobat or nobody follows it, it does become the acrobat of equal level."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At least begin with the other at the same level."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In this case, it's a teacher in the same perspective."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's a point where it may be a situation like this that one of them is centered, the other is not."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They still have to work together."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so the response may be, the right response is, okay, I am centered."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have the ability and the other person does not."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I need to, so I need to approach maybe that I need to be more of a, take the approach of a teacher, more patient, and more alertness, because I have to protect two of us."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And also the question of well, when maybe, you know, when they, when it was good to delay or something, when they practice, I'm sure they had a safety net underneath them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's like being on retreat then, no? Perhaps that's also in their stomach."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, no, that's very good."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we can imagine that safety net like being on retreat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then when we out of retreat, the safety net is gone."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So now it's really a job of keeping balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I wonder if part of the mindfulness isn't being aware of whether you're in the role of the base holding the pole or whether you're in the role of the acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I mean, for lack of a better word, the power that you hold in that sort of relationship or situation, and then, you know, how you proceed."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The other thing is the pole metaphor I really like, but I keep getting stuck with the fact that in the acrobat scenario, it's a voluntary sort of volitional interaction that like two consenting adults are sort of agreeing to put their trust and undertake the action."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But in real life, that's often not the case."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But can we still apply the same principles? I mean, that's when you go back to figuring out then, okay, what role am I playing in this relationship if it's sort of coming on sudden or this interaction, and then you can proceed with your mindfulness in terms of value."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, so then we go with some other similes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's now, I'm briefly presenting to other similes on this theme of mindfulness and protection."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So one is just, this is just a bare statement."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness is the one factor to protect the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So we're coming back to this topic of protection of the mind that somebody mentioned before."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The other one describes mindfulness as a careful chariot here, careful driver, we would say."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then there is mindfulness as the gatekeeper of a town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "One is it's a border town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this border town has different things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It has all kinds of things that help to keep out enemies."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And within this context, mindfulness is the gatekeeper."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's the one that knows who's allowed inside the town and those who should not enter the town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then there's another setting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's again the gatekeeper of the town, but there are two messengers and they want to know the way to the king in the town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so the gatekeeper has to tell them the fast way to the king."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the two messengers are Tranquility and Insight."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the king of the town, if we'll re-guess it, Nirvana."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "One more on the general level of dealing with sense restraint, perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Another one more on this kind of guiding role of mindfulness in the progress towards realization."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So now I've thrown these three similars at you and I would like to know which one of these similars speaks to you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "What could it mean for you? What is not unclear about it, perhaps, any comments or ideas about these similars? And also, how does mindfulness protect the mind? We had that question before."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The first that comes to mind for me is the gatekeeper of the town, in relation especially to the senses."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So how do we protect the senses? I think that's very much appreciated when we are in retreat and when we come out."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then we're bombarded by sounds and sights and smells."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "How do we balance? How do we know how to take care of that? And then in our more subtle, it's of course the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "What change of thoughts do we allow to spin in the mind? Right."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The lady here, here in front."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I relate more to the charioteer because of the metaphor of the senses as the horses."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I think also because of the movement in that, it's more to me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's the movement of the chariot and the senses versus a town and military and gates."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, it's a setting we are not so happy with."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The careful charioteer, all of you have been driving here by car can quickly relate to me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You must all have been mindfulness because you came here without an accident."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the gatekeeper speaks to me as well."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The choice and you can choose who comes into the town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's the choice to react or to sit with something that happens."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I have an ability to say like, I can choose either to react to this or I can sit with it and figure out what's really happening."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that which allows me to choose is mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Which is also protection as well."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Slowly getting a feeling for that protection thing now."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any other comments? Yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I was thinking about the first one, the factor to protect the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I've been curious about in kind of modern day Buddhist circles, there's often a talk about the heart."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I don't know whether this could also be said as a factor to protect the heart or not."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So it's the heart-mind chitta."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Chinese translation with the heart radical actually."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Well, I think I experienced heart and mind maybe not as one."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You're talking physical heart or? We have three different words for mind in Pali."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They have slightly different nuances."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Well, I often think of the mind as being where the cognition goes on, what kind of thoughts and intellectualization and stories and that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And maybe the heart being more of the place of caring and connection, vulnerability."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it seems like the awareness, it doesn't all seem one at least in my experience."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So in early Buddhism, we distinguish between three types of mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that is basically, sometimes these are mentioned as near synonyms."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So they are just shades of different meanings."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But Mano gives you this feeling of intellectual reflection."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's one of the six sense doors."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Then we have vinyana, consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And consciousness has different roles."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes it's one of the five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes it stands for the whole of the mind, that which is reborn."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it is always a conscious of something."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that is the heart mind in the sense of citta is probably the term closest to what in English we would call emotion."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it is that which also we contemplate in mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The third Satipatana is about citta, nupasana, contemplation of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So it has that caring kind of thing, but it also has the negative emotions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "None of these terms is in itself has a value that this is only wholesome or this is only unwholesome."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's like looking at the same phenomena from three different perspectives."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And here the word is citta, which corresponds to citta."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because of the heart mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "When I think about what do I actually protect, I think it's probably closer to protecting citta."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, exactly, exactly, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I became aware of this last week story about a 25 year old woman who was leading an expedition of horseback riders, eight riders into the wilderness in Montana this summer."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there was an attack by a grizzly bear who was initially chasing a deer, but then focused its attention on an eight year old boy who was on the smallest horse to attack for food because the berries hadn't ripened yet and the bears were all looking for food in this area."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the leader of the group charged the bear."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "All the horses had turned around to go back to the, they were running away from the bear basically."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The riders lost control of their horses and they were all going to run back to the camp, to the corral."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But this one, the leader of the group, she turned her horse around and charged the bear three times and eventually the bear left."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But anyway, that was just kind of a literal example that this reminds me of mindfulness and."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Thank you for sharing this."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It kind of goes with the last two similes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Thank you for sharing this story."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So how does mindfulness protect the mind? I don't understand that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can anybody explain? Yes, please? Somebody there, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "For the gatekeeper of the town, that comes to mind for me that this is a two-way process."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not only are we allowing things into the town, but we're concerned about what's leaving the town and looking at our resources, looking at safety of who's going out and timing of things, when we need to be secure, when we don't need to be secure, maybe when we're allowing everyone in for a festival."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "My idea of how mindfulness protects the mind is this."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Suppose you're angry and you're about to say something that expresses that anger."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If you're very mindful, your mind can slow down enough that you can."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "As you're starting to become angry and as you're starting to talk, you can notice the contraction."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then, if you're aware that, oh, contraction means anger."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If you know that much, you can catch yourself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If I don't know I'm getting angry, what can I do about it? That's the point."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Have we exhausted the beauties of these similes or are you still able to make some current question on them? Yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But at one point I felt like I was back in graduate school and listening to everybody's opinion about what one particular simile meant."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I was wondering about can we take similes too far? Well, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm finding myself a little bit like a pole is a pole."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The pole is not the relationship."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "What is this really all about? It was important for me, as you explained things, that I didn't realize I didn't know as much about the physical act of that particular kind of acrobatics."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I don't know if you have any comment on that or just tell me to go practice more."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm definitely going to tell you that anyway, whatever you say."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I understand what you're saying and there is sometimes a tendency to over interpret."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "For example, there's one teacher in Sri Lanka and he goes into all kinds of different stories."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's the story of a woman who has lost her husband and now she's in the middle of the river and she has one child on one side, child on the other side."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so he gets into a whole kind of thing that this means the aggregate and this is grasping and all that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I think that's really besides the point because the story is meant as a historical record."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They're explicitly introduced as similes and they are meant to stimulate us to develop inner images."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "This is a world of orality."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There are no pictures and the early discourses work a lot with pictures and they want us to interpret, to find, to give a meaning that makes this image come alive in us."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I think it's perfectly fine to interpret the Paul as a relationship, whether this was originally meant with the simile or not is not really the question."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But as long as it helps us to understand the whole thing, I think that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And allowing ourselves that freedom to work with these images can be very, very powerful, especially in practice as you are talking about practicing more."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I find sometimes in deeper practice, there's not really the place for starting to think out things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "These images that do not call up any kind of concepts can inform my practice of the proper direction to take."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "She's already getting the mic."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "As you were going over the list, I realized that I have my own set of similes and I assume that's probably the same for everyone that we each come up with our own imagery of, that reflect our experience of what it's like to practice being mindful."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And for me, it's a very domestic simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's about cleaning house, keeping my house clean and sweeping and sweeping."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there's always new dust and so it's a relentless work."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Thank you for sharing that simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes, so now we move from the similes to."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Something is going wrong here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Pushing the wrong button here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay, this is from Brennan and Yana Ponyaka."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There are these reflex moments like when we lose balance, we quickly do something to catch our balance again."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And he compares that to bear attention."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He's talking about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That in the mental realm, mindfulness gives us that ability to feel that we have to catch our balance again."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And he speaks of non-violence."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness is something that doesn't interfere with things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It sits back and allows things to unfold for us to see and understand."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it is that which enables us, we have for the example of anger, to actually know what's happening, which is the very basis for us to be able to skillfully deal with any situation in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Bear attention is just his way of describing mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He's just making an emphasis on this aspect of mindfulness that just allows things in without immediately reacting on them."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So when Yana Ponyaka is telling us how by looking after ourselves or in the acrobat simile by keeping our own balance, we are actually looking after the other."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We make them this gift of fieldlessness we were discussing earlier."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's not self-protection, it's more self-control is what is referred to here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is self-control in the case we are going to do something unwholesome, you are perfectly right."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He is telling us what the impact of somebody who is developing himself or herself, who is stopping all this craving and grasping."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I think you all would probably know what it means to be around people who are mindful, who don't crave, who don't grasp, how they inspire us, how they help us to diminish these negativities."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They don't even have to do something directly towards us, just the way they are."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have found a very powerful monk in Sri Lanka and we all think he is very highly attained."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And one of my friends said, you know, it's enough to see the shadow when he moves."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I like this idea of a contagious disease."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It just keeps on and on and gets worse and worse."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So this is all about how my self-cultivation in itself already contributes towards others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And now we come to the other aspect."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Coming back to the acrobat simile, Pali version speaks of patience and harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I mentioned that at that time already the Chinese speaks of the gift, the dhāna of fearlessness, the dhāna of non-violation, the dhāna of harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In the traditional Buddhist country like Sri Lanka, they go to such extent to prepare dhāna for us monks."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At the meditation center I was leading in Sri Lanka and sometimes we had this invitation for monks to come for the meal."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And some of these laypeople, they are there at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, they start preparing and cooking just so that at 10 o'clock there is this whole great menu there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so there is all this devotion and this love that goes into all this preparation for this type of dhāna and for the type of dhāna that we are giving here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I mean, if I want to give you the dhāna of fearlessness, of non-violation, of harmlessness, I also have to do preparation, I have to clear my own mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So giving that type of dhāna is of immediate benefit to myself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the way it expresses itself is here, loving kindness and sympathy, empathy."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We can get this very clear interrelation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You said that with the acrobat simile, that in the end it's just one balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "No longer my balance or the other balance, it's just one balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is natural to reach out to others and wanting to help them, but we have to first tidy up our own house, otherwise it's not going to work."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's beautiful simile in salekasutta."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If you're sinking in the mind in yourself, how are you going to pull out someone else? You have to stand on firm ground to be able to pull out the other."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't mean to walk away and let them sink."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's not the question, but that clear understanding, do I have enough firm ground under my feet to pull out someone else? Then start pulling out."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Otherwise we're just both going to be drowning."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Till I become perfect, it will never happen."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I didn't say that you have to become an arahan to help others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just said enough firm ground that allows you to pull out another."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm not an arahan, still I'm sitting here and talking to you, but I'm sitting at Gil's house and just doing my practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I am under the impression that I have enough firm ground under my feet."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Now I come to the last topic, how does this relate to mindfulness practice itself? And there's this aspect of in the Satipattana Sutta, we get this, I call that refrain in my book, we get this instruction for each of the exercises."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we are told one of these is that any practice should be done internally, externally and internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The interpretation of these terms is somewhat complex."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I do not want to go into too much detail now unless you're asking for it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But my own understanding from what I can gather from the early discourses and also the early Abhidharma is that probably what was originally meant is myself and others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That seems to be the basic meaning behind that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there's a very strong interrelation when we practice mindfulness because mindfulness is not only when we sit in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So seeing how others relate to what I do, like now, are you falling asleep? Are you aware? I need to have that awareness for me to keep that talk going on."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At the same time being mindful of myself, what am I going to say next? I also have to keep that in mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's a continuous interrelationship."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we can also learn so much from others, how others react to situations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I tell you a little story about my own practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "My main defilement is anger."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Long time ago, it has changed."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm actually a totally different person."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It was just because of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But I was extremely angry before."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And when I started to meditate, this anger thing was really difficult."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because behind that anger, there was a feeling of righteousness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There was one situation in Sri Lanka in a meditation center."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we were just meditating and the official hour of meditation was over."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But the rule was if people keep on sitting, you leave them alone."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Somebody had to clean up the hall."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this person was not willing to wait."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because for some reason she wanted to do it right away."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so she started to make a whole mess in the hall."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I felt myself getting slowly like building up."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Like, she's not supposed to be doing that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "She's disturbing our practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I was just about going to get really angry."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And somebody else was faster than me and also got angry."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that person did exactly what I was about to do, this kind of."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it looked so stupid, you know."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It was such a foolish thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And when I saw somebody else acting on what I was about to do, I suddenly realized what I'm doing every time I'm getting angry."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it was so helpful for me to realize that anger is just foolishness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that really helped me to work with my anger."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So that is a way of how observing externally can inform our own practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's just a little example."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There's a continuous going forth and back."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Those streams that are in the world are held in check by mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And with that, I come to the conclusion of my talk."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I thank you so much for all the beautiful comments you made, the contributions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And we have another 15 minutes time for any questions that you might want to ask."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But I really enjoyed today with you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have taken quite a number of new points, the dancer and so many other things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's really lovely because you see, if I just sit here in front and talk and talk and talk, I mean, what I'm talking about already knows."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I'm going on with nothing."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But when you contribute, when you say something, each of you has your own experience, your own perspective, your own idea, and I learn so much from that and I go out and I'm really enriched by that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I thank you very much for that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any comments or questions you would like to ask? Yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's just a silly question."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That last saying there, just push my buttons, because I've been asking the question about a fluid center versus a sticking to my center, and there it's."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The streams stand for the unwholesome, the unwholesome that carries us away, the craving that carries us away."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Because I think I don't want to control nature, allow it to flow through, come back, you know."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's just a question of holding in check, so we are not done."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Those streams in the world that desires the craving are held in check by mindfulness, but they are cut off by wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So mindfulness is not cutting off the stream, it's just keeping it within a boundary, but it's letting it flow."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's the context of the simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I really appreciate the slide before that one that you brought up and explained, because when I first discovered Satipatana Sutta, those two were really brought up a lot of questions on me, so I even searched some monks in the Seolzi area to when it asks one of the Burmese monks to help me explain the way you just did."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So still remember the word in Pali, Ajatama Jaita."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "No, thank you very much for that one."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I think what came for me is that how interconnected everything is and the impermanence of everything."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Like greed and hate can affect everybody."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "If I have it, it affects everybody."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So there's so much interconnectedness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And in terms of the question how the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can you keep the mic a little bit in front of you?."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "protect the mind? I think that what I learned so much at going to Vipassana is how to rest the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And sometimes I think that every time that we are paying attention to our breathing and doing a sweep of mass, we are resting the mind and the learning."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I think we get so much intoxicated with information."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And even the words, sometimes I don't want to learn anything."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just want to go to the spaceness of feeling."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just decided to meditate and pay attention to how many breaths can I have without having any thoughts coming in."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's very interesting and sometimes it seems like to create equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's just to rest the mind from all the external and internal things that come in."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's how I protect my mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's beautiful resting the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It can go off the outside world and when the mind rests in itself, concentration develops, happiness comes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You had mentioned about three frameworks of mindfulness in one of your previous lectures."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The three establishments of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Compared to the four-fold we are accustomed to."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can you talk about those three frameworks? These are the three Satipatanas practiced by the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They are specifically associated with the Buddha himself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They are not the way we are taught to practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there is his equanimity in relation to three different situations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "All of those who are there listen to him."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Some listen, some don't listen."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "All of those who are there are not listening to what he teaches."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In each of these situations he is mindful, clearly aware, and equanimous."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They are the three different situations."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Those who listen, those who don't listen, nobody listens."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You are very nice, you don't give me a chance for number three, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Have you clarified that? The lady here? I have a developing question about mindfulness and wisdom and other factors."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You had a slide a few back that the body makes these spontaneous balancing moves."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It seems to me the mind makes these spontaneous not taking up harmful subjects and so forth after a while."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But it seems that that is not really mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then I got back to wondering about the whole acrobat simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is really effort and wisdom and effort, isn't it, that makes the actual moves."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The mindfulness part is just being present."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not being distracted somehow, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is an important point with all this interest we have in mindfulness and the emphasis of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We should always understand mindfulness stands in the context of the Eightfold Noble Path."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there is the basis of sealant, which sometimes in modern applications of mindfulness is not really emphasized, at least as much as I would like it to be emphasized."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes something needs to be done, very right."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And there is also that which comes after mindfulness, the resting of the mind in concentration."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But the kind of spontaneous movement that you do in the balancing, it seems to me, is quite like wisdom, just somehow knowing what to do."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But I think what Venerable Nyanapunika wanted to say is just that this mindfulness has to be as in tune with the situation as quickly as this kind of time of balance."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That is, I think, what he tried to say."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have that where I do my long retreats in Sri Lanka."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's usually that part of the year there's a lot of rain and there's this footpath we have."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so because the earth is very hard from all the walking, it doesn't become muddy."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But because of the rain, it has a little slime on top."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "One moment of not mindfulness, you are fed on the ground, the whole robes are dirty."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So you really want to have this kind of thing in order to arrive at the meditation hall."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And all of a sudden, look, the teacher was not mindful, look at his robes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I found myself still thinking of the simile you mentioned this afternoon about the practice being like kneading of the dough, the meditation practice, and the knowledge being like the yeast."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And that came to the, that then brought me to the question, how do you balance, protect your mind, your practice functioning as a monk and as a professor in the academic world? Very good question."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, I have throughout giving absolute priority to the practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And so when I did that PhD on Satipatana, I usually did morning, like I would go begging in the early morning and then take my meal and until, until noon time, it's time for study and the whole afternoon I practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the situation changed when I went to Germany and I decided, now I'm doing it differently."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm three days of the week I'm practicing, four days of the week I'm studying."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And now at present, I, practice has become so strong, I can't handle that anymore."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm doing four days of the week."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Every day I do, when I do retreat, I do 12 hours of sitting and a little bit of walking."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I do very intense practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "When I come out, I'm there with my parents, I do my academic work and then I drop it again."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And this is what really keeps me going."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And the thing is really that I think we need to give priority to the practice and everything else then falls into place."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And it's very cute, you know, we had a very big conference in June."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's the most important conference for Buddhist scholars, the IAPS conference."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And all the colleagues are kind of like, how come you write so much? And they say, I'm meditating."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And they go like, what? But it is the fact because as I come out of my practice, the mind is so clear and I know what I want to send."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just write these articles and they are finished."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And someone else or even like in situations like for example now, I have done a whole week of intensive teaching in Hamburg and now I've been teaching here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I will be totally unable to write an article."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I will be at the same mental level as all my colleagues are all the time, which means you start writing and then you're correct and you move around, you do again and it takes such a long time."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So for the ability to balance all these two aspects, strong practice is needed."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And when I originally ordained, I only practiced for quite some time to get a basis."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But eventually it's possible and when you come to that level, both sides benefit."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But the thing is really to give priority to the practice, to make this the number one thing in our life because we are all going to die."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And at that time, the question is, what did I do with my life? And that's not the question, did I become a professor or not? How many friends I got and blah blah blah."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The question is how much did I develop myself? And that thing, having that in front and saying every day like, am I getting there or not? That gives, that sets priorities very clear."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then life becomes very easy."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You're dancing with things."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You mentioned at the time, when you were dying, you would say, what did you do with your life? And I have to ask a blunt question that is maybe naive, but I have to ask it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "How many of you did you choose that you spent your whole life each week, four days practice and three days writing, doing your thing? And you look back on your life."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Why is it that you wouldn't say, I only had three-sevenths of a life? I only had three-sevenths of a life because, in other words, did you explain to me how your four days of practice is rewarding and full of life more than or even."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But brother, this is the most meaningful thing to do to meditate."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's why I said maybe I'll be naive."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I come out of twelve hours of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The first thing goes like, wow! Okay, please explain that to me."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The joy, the happiness, the happiness of concentration, the happiness of insight, nothing comes up to that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Forget about sex, forget about music."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Excuse me? Einstein probably thought seven days a week, and we look at him and we say he was such a creative person, and he had such a."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But if he had meditated four days a week and worked three days a week, I'm an analytical person."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I say maybe he only had three-sevenths of creativity."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I am more productive in this way than I would be if I would not meditate."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So Einstein might have been more creative."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I don't know what Einstein."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I'm just talking about myself."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But theoretically or ideally, you know."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Let's be with the present situation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There is no other scholar that I know at present who is publishing as much as I do."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I publish between twelve articles per year and one monograph."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "There is nobody else I know who does that much."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But if I am free to decide what I like, I wouldn't be sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "You saw the first twenty minutes when you rang the bell, I thought, I don't want to talk now."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Four more minutes, one last question."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "In terms of being centered in your body, I've noticed there are times that I have discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And how do you deal with discomfort in your body? And does that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I guess I'm curious as to what that holding is about."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have a lot of pain in one of my hips."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Is there a way to deal with it skillfully? Pain is one of the most powerful objects of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I have a lot of pain also."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And sometimes when the two fellows come together, it's excruciating."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Just being aware of the pain."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not doing anything about it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not I'm in pain, just pain."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Not easily get sidetracked."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And a lot of freedom in my relation to this body comes out of that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I'd almost say I wish you a lot of pain because you will have wonderful, powerful meditation."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I don't wish you the pain that I have, but it's a very powerful stuff."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Just the thing of staying aware without reacting is everything that's required."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Similarly, the sattva sutta in the Samyutani kaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The discourse on the arrow."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Distinguishing between the situation of pain by an experienced meditator and by somebody who does not meditate."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the experienced meditator feels the pain."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "He or she knows it's painful, but doesn't react."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The uncultivated person, the one who doesn't meditate."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Oh, my God, what's going to happen? I'm sick."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Who's going to look after me? How am I going to do it? All two arrows, three arrows, four, chum, chum, chum, chum."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That one arrow we can't avoid, but the others we can."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And pain is the time when we are learning that."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Do you also, do you meditate four days in a row? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then three days working? Yeah, I know I'm doing Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I need that because after three days of academic work, the first day in the morning, the mind is still running."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I found, like, I like to sit for a long time."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So what I do, I just sit and I just let the mind run."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Hey, stay there, stay there."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just let it run for a little while."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And after some time it quietly comes back and settles down and then I go."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So I need that transition."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And also the Thursday morning when I come out, I'm a little, I've learned, don't reply to emails on Thursday morning."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So we are there at nine o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Thanks to all of you for your attention, for your comments, for your questions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I really rejoice in our meeting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "May all of you be well, happy, healthy."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And may all of you progress on this wonderful path to liberation, liberation of the mind from all defilements, protecting ourselves, protecting others."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So, welcome to this second talk on a series of talks on the topic of meaning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Meaning, meaning-making, and relationship to meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And one of the areas that we."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So, first I want to say is introduction that there's a cliché that everyone is a philosopher, but they don't know it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Many people don't know it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And what that means, I think, is that everyone has a set of interpretations, meaning, understanding of what it means to be alive, what's important, what this life is about, that they operate from."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Though sometimes it's not reflective, sometimes they don't even thought about it, haven't realized they're doing this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And part of a path of mindfulness is both to be reflective about this, to be clear and conscious, but also to discover what are some of the underlying assumptions, belief systems, interpretations that we are basing our life on."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And as we sit quietly in meditation, it's possible to see these operate, and then also to question them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Some of them aren't really that helpful or healthy for us, and some of them are."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "To be able to distinguish between which is useful or not, which is inaccurate or not, is part of the wonderful power of meditation, of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So one area that we can connect, one area of meaning-making and connection to meditation is our understanding of what it means to be a self and what it means to have other people in relationship to a self."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "That there's a lot of philosophy, a lot of ideas that come along with our notions of who we are and who others are and what that connection is."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "I think a wonderful story around this was some years ago, there was someone who did a study of different meditation centers."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "I think they're all in the United States."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Some of them were primarily, the participants, the meditators, were primarily born and raised in the United States, culture-rated in his local United States-Yan culture, and some were culture-rated in an Asian culture that had a much stronger collectivist culture, a much stronger sense of communal sense of identity and who they are, whereas in the United States, many people who grew up in this culture have a much stronger sense of individuality and individual."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So researchers studied these two different meditation centers and asked the participants, how was the retreat you did? They both did week-long retreats or something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "How was the retreat and what did you gain or what was the benefits from the retreat? Both groups loved the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So that they had in common."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "But when they discussed what they benefited from them and what way it was so great, in one way or the other, the people who had been raised in this local culture in the United States, they emphasized that they discovered who they are, they got a sense of real independence and freedom, and all the reference points were very individualistic."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And those people who came from the Asian culture, they said, oh, I realized how much gratitude I have for my society, my family, how deeply connected we are, and I've appreciated so much more all the benefits I've received from my society, my family, my everyone, and the sense of connection and gratitude and being part of something was so powerful for me."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so in many ways, maybe they were having similar, you could say similar experience of settling, getting concentrated, becoming still, letting go of hindrances, but the meaning or the value that they took out of the experience, what they selected out of their experiences, this is what is important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "One was very individualistic, one was more about how they are in their collective."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so this speaks to how, and often that's invisible, that we make the selections."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "It seems like this is natural."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Of course, this is like, isn't this what it's all about? Because the view we have of what's important is not just taken for granted, it's built into the fabric of the universe that self is important and discovering the self."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "A similar thing happened to me many years ago where I was on a panel with a Christian minister, and I was kind of like the Buddhist teacher minister."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And there also, the person that I was with was Asian, Asian-American, and I represented people from the United States, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Europe was kind of this individualist, Norway where I'm from is very individualistic, maybe even more so sometimes than the way we are in the United States."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And we were asked, you know, what brought you into Buddhism or into your religion? She was Christian."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And for me, I was kind of happily, matter of fact, as if there was the most natural thing in the world back then, was talked about how, you know, finding myself or finding this inner freedom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And she talked about how her Christian faith, how much it put her into a community of fellow people in relationship to society and people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "That was what was so meaningful for her and found a sense of belonging at home."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And there again, we see this, you know, people entering into a religion have very different orientation of what they're looking for and what they want."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So we also come with a lot of ideas, not just like that, but what it means to be an individual, what it means to be a self, what's important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so when we sit down to meditate, it's part of what our motivation can be is about that self."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "It could be that we're, you know, we're looking for how to be a better, you know, get a career advancements."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so we've been told that we're too anxious."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so you need to meditate to get calmer and quieter because that's how you're going to, you know, be more respected at work."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so it's all about me attaining something, getting something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "It could be that it could be, you know, it's another person has been told that, you know, you really don't fit into the community here very well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And you might try meditating because then you'll relax and start feeling more connected to the people around you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so the meditation can have a different function for different people depending on what seems important for them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And then, so then also the locus of what's valued the most around the self is the self as an autonomous, independent person."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "What's most important and we have to realize that and find it or is a self as someone embedded in a system of relationships with other people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And somehow finding ourselves kind of connected to that embedment and embedded nature of society or social connections."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "That meditation is going to help us to really feel connected to that and feel much more part of it in a deeper and deeper way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "I've seen, you know, my early years when I was first coming to Buddhism and was kind of here with a lot of new people coming to Buddhism, how many people, some people were really coming to find themselves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And what they found was instead of finding themselves, or maybe they did because they found themselves, then at some point they found themselves back into the deeper connection to the religion they grew up with."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so they will go back into a church or a synagogue or something and in a way that they then participated more in the collective life of it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Other people I've seen goes into Buddhism and also finds a sense of community there and that's what's kind of more important than the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Because that's what they're culturally or personally, their philosophy, what they think is important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And some people, you know, just for some whatever reason find that their engagement with Buddhism is always very personal and they're happy to go off and be hermits and long periods of meditation without much connection to others."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Is one better or worse than the other? I'd rather not think that way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "There are all ways of organizing, meaning, purpose in this world of ours, and maybe they all have a place, they all have a role."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "There's a time and season for all things and there's a place and society for maybe all the different ways that we can construct our sense of self, our sense of meaning, our sense of being connected to others."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "It's kind of like a discovery."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "It's kind of like the, as I said in the meditation, kind of like the powers of ten."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "That meditation takes you into some deep, deep place, quiet still, letting go place."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And then how do we interpret that around how we understand the self and what's important around the self and what the self is in relationship to needs and motivations and purposes and our place in this world in that deep place? Or what's that connection from that deep place of freedom as we come back to the powers of ten, back into the world, back into society? And not a few people have found themselves transformed so that their relationship and their understanding of what it means to be in relationship to other people has radically changed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "A simple way of understanding would be that many people are codependent, very deep sense of neediness and need and really measuring their success and their well-being in relationship to other people and comparing themselves to other people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And to really delve deep into this kind of very powers of ten to go within, going within, within, letting go of the social world for a while can be transformative so that when we come back into the social world that the sense of neediness is not there anymore, the sense of comparing ourselves and measuring ourselves with other people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And then the social world can have a very different meaning than it had before."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "How much meaning it has, how important it is depends in part by the meaning-making understandings that we have about our place in the world and who we are and who we are in relationship to other people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And we shouldn't assume that two meditators share the same understanding in that range or in that of what's most important, where they most center their life and is it more in community or more in the individual and what other kind of secondary understandings come from that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So without saying any of us are right and wrong, I think that's very important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "What I'd like to say is that it's important to become reflective about, to think deeply about, to realize what we're operating under, what are the assumptions, what are the beliefs we have around self, around others."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And to dismiss this whole investigation of self, because Buddhism says there's no self kind of, not to focus on self, is it easy that we almost miss or not notice that we actually haven't, almost subconsciously, unconsciously deeply embedded notions and operating principles around what it means to be a self and what's important and what kind of selective process attention is used for to pick out and recognize and know in this world what's important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So I offer this with the hope that you will maybe spend some time today, maybe talking with friends and others, about your own central focus on understanding of what it means to be a self, an individual, and what beliefs and ideas come along with your sense of personhood and what is it to be in a person in society and what are the beliefs and ideas and understandings that come along with how you are embedded in society."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "Are you embedded or are you really removed? What's the connection there? And I hope that if you reflect deeply on these things and think about them, that when you come to do your meditation, some of those things can be put down, can be put to rest temporarily."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And they won't be operating and turning away in some maybe quiet, deep way and allow something, some power of ten to open up for you, whether it's power of ten deeper and deeper in or power of ten further and further out."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "That's for you to discover."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "This morning, probably from about 2."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "30, there were lightning and thunderstorms here in this general area of Redwood City."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And it was quite something to be awake at 3 o'clock and looking out the window and watching these big lightning storms in the sky."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I know it's common enough in other parts of the world to have this kind of lightning storms."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But where we live here, it's quite unusual, especially lasting for so long."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then before coming down here, I sometimes, especially in the summer, will like to go for a walk up in the hills."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And the question was, for me, is it safe to go up in the hills? There's certainly with all the lightning and there's some danger involved in going up in the hills, hiking."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so I was not afraid, but I was cognizant to the fact that there's danger involved."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so I reflected by where I was going to walk."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I chose a place to go hiking where I felt it was safe."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then as I walked, I paid attention to what was happening with the weather and how far away or how close lightning was."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Sometimes it was clear, it was quite far away."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so it turned out well for me and it did rain on me a teeny bit, but not much."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It was just really glorious to be out there in the weather and hiking in the trees."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And I tell you this story in order to make a distinction or to separate out two things that are really helpful to separate them."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And one is fear and the other is danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Not all things that we're afraid of are really dangerous."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And not all things that are dangerous do we fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And sometimes the two go together."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But not all things that are dangerous need to be feared."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And the shedding or learning to let go of fear does not mean a person no longer acknowledges that something is dangerous."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And I think one of the reasons people hold on to fear is because they think that because they conflate these two, the recognition of danger and the fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So in deep vipassana practice, this distinction is actually quite important in the sense that there's a certain kind of fear that comes in deep, probably most deep spiritual practice that calls on us to begin letting go of some of the deepest attachments we have, places of clinging, especially clinging to self, clinging to life, being alive, clinging to death, being dead, all kinds of clinging that we have, attachment to status, and to relationships, and to safety even, there's a clinging attachment to our identity that we might have is all the different kinds of aspects of identity."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There for good reason, some of them were formed in us because of the dangers we dealt with in our lives and it's a way of protecting us from the dangers."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And perhaps the fears we had that helped us protect us were beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The fact that we're afraid is not necessarily a problem."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Fear can be a wise response to danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But there's also a wise response to danger that does not have fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And this is where the Buddhist practice is going, is to learn to have a wise response to danger, and in doing so, no longer need to have fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Fear is not if its function is to keep us safe, but if we recognize danger, there's other ways that we can keep ourselves safe without being afraid."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so this movement towards becoming fearless in a certain way is part of the movement of Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And part of the help for this is to be able to see the difference between fear and the danger, two different things."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And with that distinction, we can ask ourselves, what is it that's dangerous here? What is the danger? And sometimes just being afraid does not allow us to, it kind of masks or hides the status of the danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It's actually possible, I've had this when I was younger, I was afraid, but I could not really articulate why I was afraid of what I was afraid of."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And some of my fears, like the fears of social phobias that I had, fear of rejection, for example, or fear of not being liked, they were kind of deep and subtle that I didn't really, I knew I was afraid, I knew I was pulling back from people, but exactly what the danger was, I couldn't actually say very clearly."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But if we can actually start noticing what is the actual danger we're afraid of and see the danger is different than the fear, then it's possible to work with the fear in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Because partly because then it might be possible to be wise about the danger and take care of it in maybe a matter of fact way, or do the right thing in some ways, that doesn't require us to be afraid to take care of ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "An interesting place around the distinction is, to quote from the Buddha, he said, there's the person who, having the nature to die, is scared, scared, having care of death."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There's also the person who, having the nature to die, is not scared, having no care of death."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So death is a danger that all of us are facing."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It's there in the horizon for us at some point, sooner or later, and it could be seen as being a danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But the Buddha, there's a kind of person who's not afraid of that and has no terror, and the person who has it and the person who does not have it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And one of the functions of Buddhist practice is in fact to overcome the terror, the fear of death."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And becoming, to go really deep in practice and really have an experience for oneself, how thoroughly we can relax, or how thoroughly we can let go of clinging."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There's something about that thorough letting go of clinging that releases from us the fear of death."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And what is the connection between having no clinging and not fearing death? What's that connection? What is that relationship? Why is it that clinging can bring fear and no clinging releases it? Not simply that maybe clinging is a source of fear, but what is it that the absence of clinging teaches us? What does it point to? What does it show? And to answer that question one way is that it shows us that we have the capacity, we have the potential to live completely at peace, relaxed and open and present."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And there's something about that state that teaches us that it's not worth clinging."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Even this idea of clinging to life, holding on to life and not dying, if that's what's happening, that somehow it's not worth it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It's not worth collapsing or contracting or losing the state of relaxation, the state of openness, the state of non-clinging, the peace that's there."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And it's a kind of interesting juxtaposition, interesting kind of dilemma even, whether to allow oneself to stay open and non-clinging, or to feel the demand for clinging, or the authority of clinging, or the insistence that, you know, the danger is so great, I have to cling."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I've known people who are clinging to all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It's only when they knew definitively that they were dying that they, I remember some people having cancer, that then they could let go fully, and they had no fear at the end of their life."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It was quite remarkable, and there were people, I've known people, who would actually go to spend time with those people, not because they were supporting them, because they were dying, but rather because there was this peacefulness about them that was teaching, there was a wonderful to be with and around."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And the way that the Buddhist teachings work, they are not an escape from life."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "They're not a removing ourselves from life, but rather it's a courageous confrontation, meeting of life, so that we have no fear of life anymore."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "We still face dangers, but then to take care of those with the best wisdom we have without being scared."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Now in this kind of teaching, the Buddha made a distinction, it's not quite his language, it's a distinction between wholesome fear and unwholesome fear, or useful fear and unuseful fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And not all fear is the same."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And some fear has a role, an important function in life."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And given that the Buddha had such a great emphasis on the path to liberation, there were certain fears connected to that path."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And for a new monastic, he talked about for someone who's newly ordained, in other words, newly really set on the path of liberation, that they have fear for doing the slightest fault in the monastic discipline, or slightest fault in their ethical life."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And this idea of being afraid to be unethical, which is another way of saying that in Buddhist language, to be afraid to cause harm for someone else."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "This can be seen as a healthy fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There can be nervousness, there can be anxiety, there can be kind of fright around that that maybe is not so helpful, but a basic fear of causing harm."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I think there's a lot of people who just feel that that's almost innate or natural to feel it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And I know that I have it, and I don't want to not have it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That when I have that fear of causing harm, I'm not going to debate it and question whether I should have it or not."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I just, it feels like a healthy kind of movement that don't cause harm."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There is also, but then as the practice goes along, and we see more clearly how the mind operates, we start seeing that greed is dangerous to have greed."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That clinging is dangerous."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That hatred has a certain danger to it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Delusion has danger to it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There are these movements of the mind that we think a certain way and it's dangerous to think those ways."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And we start realizing that there's an internal danger from how we're engaging in the world."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And we learn that because we see over and over again the damage that comes, the pain that comes, the suffering that comes from certain movements of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And that every time we have hostility towards ourselves or towards others, it's painful, it's dangerous to do that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And to see the movements of our own mind as being dangerous, not to condemn them, not to condemn ourselves, but to say, no thank you, I don't need to do that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "No thank you, I don't have to follow that train of thought."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I don't have to continue engaging in that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I don't have to pick that up and be involved in it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then it's interesting that some of these fears that the Buddha talked about that were wholesome or useful."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There's four of them that he gave."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And it's possible we have a challenge in English to translate the first two into something that works for an English-speaking audience."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The Bhikha Bodhis translation is this."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So the first is fear of self-reproach from misconduct of body, speech, and mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So I don't know if reproach, what that means for any of you listening."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The word in Pali, vada, atavada, is more, the vada usually means to talk or to speak."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so it's like to do a behavior that gives cause to someone to come to speak to you."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Gil, I need to talk to you because of something you said."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Maybe the reproach is a little bit too, sounds like too much like criticism, but you know, someone doesn't say, Gil, I need to criticize you, but I need to talk to you."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So I don't know what that is, but a certain kind of mature, serious engagement about honest conversation about what our behavior has been."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so this atavada, self-speak, self-concern, self-reproach for harming people from body, speech, and mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That is a fear that the Buddha said is healthy."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The second is fear of others coming to talk to us."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Fear, the bigger body has a fear of reproach from others."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But fear that, you know, I have people in my life who are my teachers and I hold them in high respect."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And I kind of don't want, I wouldn't want to say certain things, do certain things that they know about."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Their view of me is important for me or still has an impact on me or concern for me."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so because of my respect for them, because of their support for me and all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So I do have some fear, I don't think they'd reproach me yet, but they would fear them."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Gil, I need to talk to you about something."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That's kind of a healthy concern."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I feel like it's an act of respect, an act of responsibility to be amenable, to be open, to have my elders and my friends or anyone to come and talk to me."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Gil, we need to talk about something."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So a certain kind of fear around my behavior."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The fourth fear is not about oneself."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The Buddha talks about fear of punishment."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That's the only thing that keeps some people from stealing, for example, breaking the law."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then the fourth one he talks about is a fear of a bad destination, which means a fear of a bad rebirth."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And for some people, that's very motivating."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But as meditation practice deepens, it's really the inner life that we recognize this is where the whole movement towards freedom is."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And the deeper and deeper the spiritual life is, the more sensitive we become to the movements of the mind that are dangerous to ourselves, that harm us, that are stressful, that are agitating."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And those movements of the mind that move in the other direction."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And at some point in Deep Vipassana practice, there's a movement from feeling afraid to simply recognizing the danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "To recognizing no longer being afraid of losing things, of impermanence, of change, how much of some things are changing."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "No longer being afraid of losing a sense of self or a self-identity that we're holding on to."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I have to be a certain person and define myself a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "No longer holding on to certain pleasures and joys and things that tell me that I'm successful and good in person."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And it can feel, be afraid to let go of those things."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And that shifts to recognizing the danger involved in holding on, in clinging."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It doesn't mean we have to let go if some identities are fine to have, but it's the clinging to them."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It doesn't mean we have to let go of all pleasures, it's the clinging to them."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And we start recognizing where the danger resides is in the clinging."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So when that clinging drops, then the fear of losing those has less and less power."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So to make the distinction between fear and danger, and to use that distinction to study ourselves when we are afraid."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And this movement to study ourselves when we're afraid is a movement to not be caught and trapped by the fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And at times it's studying the fear just enough to know what we desperately need."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Sometimes we need to become safe, sometimes we need to go get out of a situation."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Sometimes we need to be quiet and just protect ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Sometimes we need to go and exercise or go to bed or I don't know what."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But once we start recognizing there's fear, then there's often this first aid that might be needed."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But as we be able to take care of ourselves better and better and have confidence in ourselves, then we can start studying the fear more carefully."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "We can begin working with it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And one way to work with it is to learn to relax."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Relaxing is one of the ways to overcome terror, to overcome anxiety attacks."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And relaxing, one of the skills of relaxing is deep breathing."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "If a lot of something really dramatic has happened, it's almost natural for some people to breathe deeply."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But to use deep breathing to keep ourselves from getting frozen from the fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And to learn to stay focused on the breath and to learn how to use deeper breaths and longer breaths."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "To keep it focused, to keep things moving, to keep it just charging."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The charge that's built up when there's some dramatic thing that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "To settle ourselves, to relax something, to have to go in front of a group of people to give a talk."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Which is frightening for many people."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "To learn how to stay focused on breathing, so breathing is relaxing."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "To learn where in the body we hold tension and learn to relax the tension."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then to learn to question, what is the danger here? What really is a danger? And if we can clearly become aware of what we think is a danger, then we can ask the question, is that really a danger I have to be concerned with? If I'm going to be afraid of what people think of my wardrobe, and I show up in a social situation and I'm nervous and afraid, but I don't recognize what they think about my clothes, then I might act kind of funny."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "But if I ask myself what I'm afraid of, it's my wardrobe, at least I think I would just shrug my shoulder and say, you know, I don't need to be afraid of that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Let them think what they think of my wardrobe."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So, and then one of the things we realize if we ask ourselves, what do we think we're afraid of, what is a danger, is some dangers are imaginary."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Some dangers are predictions about the future."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Some dangers that I have more to do with our imagination than what's actually happening."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so do we want to, does it make sense, we really see that, it's the act of the imagination, it's the predictions of the future, that can start creating a little space where we can begin maybe allowing ourselves to enjoy and relax and feel the safety here of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And to keep learning how to relax, keep learning how to relax."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "As I said before, during the meditation, relaxation is often taught for people as a beginning, beginner's practice for meditation."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Often the beginning of meditation is good to relax."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "It's also a practice, or it's also a skill for someone who's an advanced practitioner."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "The more developed and experienced a person comes in meditation, the easier it is for them to relax."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And then they find themselves able to relax in so many different circumstances so that they can be wiser, more intelligent, more caring, more attentive to the situation."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "They can be focused on the task, much better if relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So those are my thoughts about today."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And I hope you find them useful, and I hope that you find this distinction between fear and danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "A nice thing to separate out and help you find your way with your fears more."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And working with fear is part of the parcel of vipassana practice, and rather than feeling somehow that something's wrong with you because you're afraid."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And if you're a vipassana mindfulness practitioner, the occasions you have to work with fear are actually great occasions of practice."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Fears are there because fears are really a symptom of something deeper inside of us that really needs our attention, needs us to connect to it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so to use the fear as a doorway to deeper self-understanding is one of the great parts of this path of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "There's no need to be afraid of your fear."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So thank you very much for today, and I really appreciate the chance to be here and talk on this subject."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And now it looks like it's clearing up, and I think the lightning is over, I'll go on to the next danger, which is driving on the freeways of the bay area."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, welcome everyone to this series on the three characteristics, the three characteristics of existence, or the three facts, the three marks, the three recognitions."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "What's important to say about these three characteristics is that they are not a theory, they are not a belief system."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "They are what we see, what we recognize when we look deeply, when we look closely."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And this is important because the Buddha did not create a dogma."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "He did not develop a belief system."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Rather, he developed ways for us to see things more clearly, to see what is really going on, and thereby be able to recognize how we suffer and how we can stop suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, these are characteristics that if we look closely, we will see that they are true, that this is in fact what happens."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, last week we talked about anicha or impermanence, the understanding that everything is constantly changing, and everything that arises has the nature to pass away."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, everything that comes into being will come out of being like waves on the ocean, you know."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We come out of emptiness, we have a lifespan, 80 or 100 years, and we go back into emptiness."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's just the way things are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And as we know, the Buddha was very practical."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "He purposely did not talk a lot about cosmology or metaphysics because there are so many things that we just can't know, although he said he understood quite a bit."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And they are distractions from the business at hand, the business at hand being seeing our suffering and seeing how we can let go of it, how we can reduce the amount of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, seeing these characteristics clearly help us to understand the nature of things and therefore not to fight with how things are, not to resist how things are, but to go with it, we could say."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, the second one, the second mark or the second characteristic is that of dukkha, or often we say suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That's not the best translation, but it is the most common."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "In actuality, dukkha means that the hub of the wheel is a little off-kilter, a little off-center."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so dukkha is not just huge, enormous suffering, terrible things."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It is also that sense of dissatisfaction, that sense that things are not just right."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So, words like dissatisfaction, unsatisfactoriness, stress, disappointment, what else? Unreliability, discontent."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "All these refer to what we typically just say, suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it's important to recognize that suffering has these different elements, qualities, that suffering can be quite subtle."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's not always so evident, perhaps, and we'll see that more as we go on."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then the third characteristic, which we will talk about next week, is that of non-self, or not-self, or emptiness, or selflessness."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And this is the most challenging one, probably the most challenging one to speak about, and the most challenging one for people to hear."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There are many, many misunderstandings, many misconceptions, and hopefully we can clear some of those up next week."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Please come with your questions, and I encourage you to question me, challenge me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That will help me to be able to speak about it in a more helpful way."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But today we are talking about dukkha, and I want to remind us that although we speak of these three characteristics separately, in fact they are very intertwined."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You almost can't speak about one without the other, impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The recognition of impermanence leads to dukkha, because we are constantly trying to make permanent what is not permanent."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And often, although the recognition of non-self can be very freeing, it's really, when we really get it, it's wonderful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But when we're first introduced to it, it can create suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It can be difficult to get."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It can feel very, very untrue, ego-distanic."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It is ego-distanic, for sure."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So these characteristics are very much interwoven and related to each other."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I want to read you from the Dhammapada, where the three characteristics are listed and spoken about."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And this, of course, is Gil's translation of the Dhammapada."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "All created things are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "This is the path to purity."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "All created things are suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "This is the path to purity."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "This is the path to purity."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So seeing clearly these three characteristics leads us to be disenchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Interesting way of putting it, isn't it? And we can think about sometimes how we might be enchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But this helps us to be disenchanted with suffering and is the path to purity."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Jack Cornfield says, the realization of these characteristics can cut through all grasping and goals and guide us to wisdom."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And the Buddhist dictionary says, it is the full comprehension of the three characteristics by direct meditative experience."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So we talk about them, but the important thing is that each of us recognize them for ourselves, which constitutes liberating insight."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it's the direct recognition of these through our own meditative experience that constitutes liberating insight."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So seeing these characteristics directly, seeing today our suffering leads to insight."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So sometimes, you know, people think or people will say, oh those Buddhists, all they talk about is suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Buddhism can have a reputation because of the foreign truth for being a tradition that talks about suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And of course, to some extent, I mean there's some truth to that in that we do talk about suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But of course, you all know that's not all we talk about."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And other people find it a relief that we talk about suffering because sometimes other traditions don't."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And people get the idea if they're suffering, which we all are, it's a universal phenomenon, they must be doing something wrong."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Or there must be something wrong with them."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Often traditions put a very heavy emphasis on optimism or positiveness."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that certainly has its place."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it can sometimes be to the exclusion of recognizing the pain and the suffering that is inherent in existence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so basically what we're talking about are the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And this is what the Buddha taught in his first sermon, the first turning of the wheel."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "This is the basis of Buddhist understanding, Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The Four Noble Truths are common to all sects, all divisions of Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "They may have different practices or they may have different understandings of certain things."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But the Four Noble Truths are basic to all."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And of course, we know that the first noble or ennobling truth, you may have heard Gil refer to the truths as ennobling truths."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And John Peacock, when he was here, said that actually was a better translation than noble truths."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "They're ennobling when we see them clearly."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And the first of these is the recognition of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That there is suffering in this life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it's important to remember that this suffering is universal."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That there is suffering in life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And each of us experiences our little peace."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I don't know about you, but that can be helpful to me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That I'm not somehow separate or I haven't done something terrible that I should suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But understanding that suffering is common to all of us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And by and large, what the Buddha was talking about was the suffering within us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There is no doubt enormous suffering in the world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And we know that more and more now because of communication and because our world is getting so small."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So certainly I, and I'm sure all of you, are so much more aware of the suffering than I ever was before as a young person."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I'm sure for you as well, for me, sometimes it's very difficult to hold the enormity of the suffering in this world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So actually it was the suffering in the world that led the Buddha to explore the reason for human suffering and what could be done about it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But what he is referring to is the suffering within ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Understanding that if we can relieve ourselves of suffering, then of course we will relieve the suffering in the world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So the point of our meditative practice is to point us back, back to ourselves, back to our own suffering so that we understand it, we see it clearly, we can let go of it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Sometimes we don't want to admit that we suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Sometimes I like to think, oh, you know, I'm, I'm beyond that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I remember many years ago talking to Gil, I said, I don't suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And he said, oh yeah? What about, you know, that audita? Oh, he knew me well enough, of course, to know that I was not completely free of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And he knew exactly what to, what to point to."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I say that because I think we, we have a tendency to sometimes dismiss our suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We, sometimes we just plain don't want to recognize it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's not much fun actually to, to take a look at our suffering, especially in the moment."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's very easy to say, I don't, I don't really suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But the reality is until we are completely free, we do suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And just to go back to the Four Noble Truths for a moment, remembering that the second of the truth is the cause of suffering, the root of our suffering, which is clinging or craving, or actually any time we want things to be other than how they are, we suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so that can be a clinging, a holding on to what we like, wanting to have more of it, or a pushing away, a resisting of what we don't like, not wanting to have it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "In either case, we're resisting the way things are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then, of course, the third truth being that there can be an end to suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There is an end in Buddhist understanding."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's called nirvana, or freedom, or enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then the fourth truth being the eightfold path."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's the path that we, the path of practice, really, the path that we walk that can lead us to the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But for today, we're just going to focus on the first truth, the truth of dissatisfaction or stress, let us say."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And we want to see it clearly because we want to see how our suffering drives us, or is the impetus for so much of our action, so much of what we do, to avoid suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So much of what we do is about getting pleasure and avoiding suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so today, we're going to focus on seeing clearly the suffering in our life, not in a morbid way, but in a freeing way."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because if we don't see it, it doesn't go away, it's there anyway, it drives us and we don't have much control."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But if we see it, we can learn to let go of it or learn to not do the things we're doing to create the suffering and thereby become free of it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I just want to reiterate it because I think it's so important that when we feel pain or distress or dissatisfaction, it's so easy to blame ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we don't want to do that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It is not that we have done something wrong."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Of course, there are times that we can learn from it and learn to do something more skillful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But that's different from blame."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's different from feeling that somehow we are bad or wrong because we suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, so often people will say, but why? Why did this happen to me? Why did I do? And of course, the Buddhist answer is, why not? Why not me? Not in a blaming way, but just the recognition."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, things happen to all of us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So if I lose my father at age 29, I didn't like that very much."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But a lot of people lose their father at two years or 12 or 23."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, I'm hardly the only one to have lost my father at an early age."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And 29 is not as early as two or three or six."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it's not that I did something wrong."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Although I have to tell you, I sure felt that way at the time."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I felt like, why did you leave me? Why? My brother had died five months earlier."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I thought, you know, he cared more about my brother."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "He wanted to go be with my brother than be with me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That was enormously painful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, the reality is it didn't have much to do with me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But his death didn't have much to do with me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Had more to do with him, and what he was doing, and how he felt probably, and et cetera, et cetera."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So remembering that it's not that we've done something wrong."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That suffering is a fact of life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And anytime that we are liking something or not liking something, knowing that that can lead to suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because if we grasp or if we resist, that will lead to our suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I want to refer you to the first couple of chapters in Gil's book, the first one on the Four Noble Truths, and then the second one on tolerating suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I don't think I've ever heard another teacher talk about tolerating suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it's a very good point."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Recognizing how we tolerate suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And seeing the difference between accepting and tolerating."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I don't think in the book, but I think I've heard him, or maybe it's my example, I don't know, but anyway, the example of having a pebble in your shoe and tolerating that suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Rather than stopping, taking off the shoe and getting rid of the pebble, how many times do we just keep walking? I know I sure have."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it's not a huge annoyance, but it's that dissatisfaction."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's that constant unpleasantness that is constantly there."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I could easily stop and get rid of the pebble and it would be gone."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So seeing where we tolerate suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And he suggests that there might be times that it might be valuable."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It might be helpful to us to put up with something."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "He calls it suffering not something we don't like."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "He talks about going to school, you know, having to put up with a lot of whatever to get a degree that is going to pay off in the long run."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Or exercise, which may not feel so pleasant at the time, but we know in the long run is going to be good for us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But he also suggests that there may be times that we tolerate suffering that the payoff is not going to be so good."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And he uses the example of the drive for money or the drive for material success."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There may be times that that can be quite useful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But sometimes it may be out of balance."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It may not the sacrifice that we make may not be worth the reward in the end."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I have a neighbor who works two jobs all the time."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And her son-in-law told me that it's because she wants to work now and save up money and then retire."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And, you know, it can make some sense."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we all know how many times people have done something like that only to retire and have a heart attack or have, you know, something else terrible happen."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So weighing or being aware is the suffering that I'm experiencing now."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Is it worth it in the long run? I know someone else who has a very, very stressful job and works very hard."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it's sort of the same thing in order to build up a very good retirement."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But in the meantime, there are health issues and the health issues are increasing."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So is it worth it? Is it really worth it? And each of us, you know, can probably look at some situation in our life where we're doing something that we think is going to have a payoff in the long run."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But if we look really carefully, is it worth it? Is it worth it? So another piece to be aware of is our relationship to suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "How do we relate to it? Are we accepting of it? Are we resisting of it? Do we deny it? Do we actually embrace it? Identify with it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Sometimes people can build an identity around suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I am a sufferer or I am a victim."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that can become an identity that someone carries."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then rather than learning to alleviate their suffering, they may be caught in a position of creating more and more because that's how they see themselves."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "To be free of suffering, they might not know what to do."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And there can be some of that for all of us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We all have tendencies that we might not like, but to be free of them might be kind of scary."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it can be helpful to look closely and see, are we indulging in our suffering? Are we identifying too strongly with it? There's a saying from a Sufi master, Pierre Vallant Khan, that I very much like."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It says, may I overcome any bitterness that may have come because I was not up to the magnitude of the pain that was entrusted to me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I love that part entrusted to me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Again, that takes some of the sting out of things that have created suffering in my life, have been the root of my suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But the pain that was entrusted to me, somehow that gives suffering for me or pain or dissatisfaction a very different slant."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it helps me to to have a very different attitude, a very different relationship to the pain in my life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "One that is more along the lines of, how can I use this? As I was talking in Morgan Hill last night, I was suggesting one of the things, one of the pains suffering in my life has been a lack of self-confidence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I was considered a shy child and I was told that, so of course I developed that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that led to a lack of self-confidence and that has been something that has dogged me a good bit of my life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But there came a time when I thought rather than fighting it, how can I use this issue? And what I have found is that it can be, it can make me a much more empathetic therapist."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Psychotherapy has been my profession for many years and I have found talking with people that sometimes I make reference to how I have also worked with a lack of self-confidence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And people have responded in a way like, yes, I can see that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The way I say it, they know that that's true."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That I'm not just saying that theoretically, but that that is true."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that can help in my relationship with that person."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So things that we consider to be very stressful or painful or create suffering, is there a way that we can use those things so that that they can be beneficial rather than something we struggle against? And that word entrusted, the pain that is entrusted to me, helps me to see things more in that light."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So of course, like with everything, our mindfulness is the most important tool to recognizing, understanding, seeing clearly our own suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I'll suggest to you that over the next week, you do pay attention to the suffering in your life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The large suffering and see how refined you can get."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "See how much you can become aware of the very subtle suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, I recognize it when damn or shit comes to my mind."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, somebody cuts in front of me or I forget something or something."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And there's that, you know, it's not huge."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Hopefully nobody's around, I may not say it out loud, but that has become like a red flag."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Anytime a four letter word comes to my mind, oh, where's the suffering? Because if it wasn't suffering, that wouldn't occur to me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That wouldn't come to my mind."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it can be a very minor thing, just something that annoys me that might not annoy you."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Nevertheless, that's a little bit of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And as a long time Buddhist practitioner, my aim is to be free of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Not just the major, but all of it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it's very helpful for me to have these little red flags to notice when there is a little bit of suffering going on."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then, mostly now, I, you know, the word occurs to me and I chuckle."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Is it such a big deal, you know, that this didn't go well or something else? And for the most part, I can let go of it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Not always, of course, but but a lot of the times I can."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So our mindfulness that helps us to see our own suffering and to see the little ways in which we suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I'd like to lead you in an exercise for just a moment, if you will."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I'm going to ask you what in your life is a suffering, large or small, that you turn away from, that you don't like to acknowledge, that you don't want to admit."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "If you're really honest with yourself, and I think we all have them and usually it doesn't take too much effort to say, oh yeah, that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So if it's helpful, close your eyes and see what comes up for you."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "What is a suffering, a little a little dissatisfaction or a large, that you really don't like to acknowledge? It's very easy to turn away from."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And can you now acknowledge it? Really feel it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It might be a feeling, might be a memory, might be a story."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Be as aware as you can of the suffering, the suffering associated with whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Go right into it, as we say."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And now if you have really felt it, seen it, sensed it, let go."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Imagine it's a balloon rising into the sky."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Just totally let go of it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And what's left? What's the feeling? What's the experience? What's left as you totally let go of the suffering? And you can open your eyes."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And what anyone like to say? What is your experience? What's left when you totally let go? After I really got into the suffering, I began to realize a lot of it was related to past experiences that I was remembering from childhood and stuff."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And when it was free, I suddenly shrank down to about the age of a two-year-old and I haven't had no judgment about anything except that the world was a good place."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So I felt happy and peaceful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Someone else, what was your experience of letting go? Well, when we first were thinking about it, the suffering, and then when you first said, let it go, my body relaxed."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it shows me that not only in my thoughts do, am I carrying it, but I'm carrying the suffering in my body also, the tension."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And then after that, then I experienced just a spaciousness, just a lot of space."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I wasn't doing anything in that space or thinking anything."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There was just space all around and I felt so good."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The two of you have said most of the words that I had written down."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's a common experience when we let go."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Yes, there's that spaciousness, that relaxation, happiness even sometimes."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Related to what you were saying, Gil reminds us in the book that suffering is only in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so when we're suffering in the present moment, it's a memory of something, or it can be a memory of something past."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that can be helpful to see that it's not happening now."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's a memory of what happened."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And for something like abuse, that's not a way of dismissing it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Of course, you know, it's important to recognize and feel fully the experience of abuse."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it can be helpful to know that it's no longer happening."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's a memory of what happened."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Someone else? My suffering was related to feeling guilt about how I've treated someone."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And when I released that, immediately felt compassion for that person."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's the truth about suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That when the heart breaks with our suffering, that releases the compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So recognizing our own suffering is a way to get to the compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And compassion for ourselves and compassion for others."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So this is the reason, a main reason, that it is so important that we remember to have compassion for ourselves amidst this suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That when we are facing the suffering, it can be very challenging, very, very difficult."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It takes courage to turn and face it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And therefore, it must be done within the context of compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Compassion for ourselves, compassion for others."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And of course, the more we have compassion for ourselves, the more we can have compassion for other people."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's like so many things, you know."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "If we can't give it to ourselves, we can't very well give it to other people as well."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Anyone else? When you invited us to look at an area where we might be suffering, but we're not acknowledging it, I found myself having resistance even to that exercise."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I thought there's so many areas where I can see I'm suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Why don't we work on those? Why do I have to go find yet another one? But I was able to locate another one."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it almost felt like I had a double suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Here's yet this new suffering and the resistance to even doing this."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So it was really a surprise when you suggested now just let it go like a balloon."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because there was such a release and a lifting and a clarity of both of those types of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I felt so light and clear like, is it that simple? We think that turning to face suffering is, oh we can think a lot of things."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We think it's foolish, we think it's dangerous, we think, you know, why would I want to do that? There have been times in my life that I have faced certain things and had friends say, but why would you do that? But we find, when we do, that it does lead to a freedom."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because as Linda said, as long as we're not acknowledging that, that doesn't mean it's gone."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And there's a tension, there's a tightness, there's a discomfort within the body."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And, you know, with trauma now, there's a lot of recognition of how the trauma is held in the body."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And a lot of therapy is now body work to help release the trauma that is held within the body."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so recognizing it, recognizing the discomfort in the body, the tension, the tightness, is a way to help relieve it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Anything else? I was focusing on suffering in family relationships where there's a desire for me to want that relationship to be something that it's not."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And there's a lot of pain and suffering with the change that's not going to happen there and recognizing that change."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And when you said let it go, my first thought was, yeah, right."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There's no way because I have to face it every day."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But I put it in the balloon and let it fly and had this amazing like lightness moment that I was in this paradise for that bit of time."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I thought, you know, yes, this is something that's going to, I'm going to come across very regularly in my life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But if in those moments I can try and just do that, then what an amazing sense of freedom I will have in those small spaces."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's a good place to start in those with that suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that brings up another point which is that there are many things that that we cannot change as you suggest that we're going to come across regularly, daily."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The difference is or what the Buddha taught is that we don't have to suffer about them."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And you experience that freedom and hopefully can experience more."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But sometimes, you know, we talk about the second arrow."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And the Buddha never suggested that we could get rid of all pain in life, you know, all experience that we don't like."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we don't have to suffer about it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We don't have to tell ourselves the things we do."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We don't have to tell ourselves the stories we do."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Ain't it awful? Kind of things or make ourselves wrong for it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We can hold it as that's the way it is."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Whatever the situation is, that's how it is."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We don't have to add to it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Which is our tendency, of course."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's the acceptance."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's not that kind of acceptance."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's a realistic acceptance that that's how it is."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But do I have to suffer about it? And usually, no, I don't."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Well, life is challenging, right? Life is not for the faint-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So just because it's challenging doesn't mean we have to suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "that's what we can do something about."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We can change our relationship to it so that we don't suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because there are many, many, many things in life that could create suffering for us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because we think it should be different."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Or they should be different."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And we may not be able to change that situation."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we can change the attitude in here."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Change what we bring to that situation."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Buddhism suggests it's not what life brings us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's how we deal with what life brings us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And accepting that death and loss and disasters are part of life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So what is our attitude? How can we bring not a Pollyanna attitude, but an acceptance that allows things to be as they are? You know, during the holidays there's a lot of talk cards and signs and all kinds of things saying peace on earth."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And, you know, since being so involved in Buddhist practice, I have come to see, I was thinking this year, maybe we should instead say peace in me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because as long as we're focusing on peace on earth, it's usually, well, if they would stop fighting."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Or if this would be different."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Or if they, in my case, if they would be kinder to animals or whatever, then we could have peace on earth."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But I see this life as a schoolroom, a classroom for learning."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And, you know, there's a certain arrogance, right, when we think we know how life should be."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we can become peaceful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We can develop that peace within us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And you know when you come across a peaceful person."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It's very nice, isn't it? And it's somewhat contagious."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You want to be around that person."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so I don't think it's selfish at all."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "If we work on developing peace within ourselves, we will radiate that out to the world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And in fact, peace on earth will happen."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it will come from just our being peaceful ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I love what you said about, it's the relationship to the suffering or, you know, our attitude."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I need to be reminded of that constantly."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And the suffering that I thought of for the exercise was the fact that I'm just very, very busy at the moment in my life."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I always feel like, you know, there's another place I have to get to and more things to get done."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And there's constantly this huge list of things that aren't going to get done."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it kind of follows me around."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I carry it like on my shoulders, you know, literally almost."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because my shoulders are, you know, this tension in my body always related to this."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And, you know, if I can, and I've been working to try to figure out what can I cut out of the list."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "What do I not really need to do? But I really, I think the answer is more like, okay, just accepting the fact that at this point in my life I'm very, very busy."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I have a lot of things to attend to and a lot of responsibilities and be okay with that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's really the answer rather than, you know, well, I don't really need to do laundry or I don't really need to go grocery shopping or maybe my son doesn't need to go to another sport thing, practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "No, you know, those things are important."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I need to just honor that and accept it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And it won't always be this way."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Maybe not tomorrow, but eventually."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Yes, I catch myself too when, when I get very busy."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "The mind saying, oh, I don't have time for that."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Oh, I'll never get it all done."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's a good place to catch myself."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And actually what I find when I don't say that, if I just, you know, oh, it'll get done."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Oh, I'll do, which of course I do."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But if I'm not saying that to myself, there's so much more space."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There's so much more time."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So being aware of what we're telling ourselves, which is really just what you're saying, that relationship, and stopping the not helpful, the unskillful mind talk."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Let's sit for just a minute."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Taking a couple of deep breaths and letting all the words just wash through you."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Not grasping onto anything."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Just being very present in a relaxed way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Connecting to your body, the sense of being where you are, your physical posture and at the beginning of a meditation, it can be helpful to just really take in whatever is most available in terms of being here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You don't have to try to dive in and find something subtle, but just like contact of the body against the chair or cushion, any physical sense of sitting, just being aware that you're sitting, sitting and breathing, and just exploring, remembering to be with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You may notice, I often notice at the beginning of the sitting the kind of pull to what I had been doing or other things in my day that I might need to do, just gently letting that go and remembering here and now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "And as I arrive, then I bring in often the reminder to relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Relaxation being such a support to this quality of being present, being aware of what's happening in the present moment, and so allowing the body to soften and relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "And even internally with physical sensations inside the body, physical tensions and holding can be sometimes if we become aware of them, they can be released."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "So perhaps the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Perhaps the heart, the area of the heart can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "This visceral area of the body is often very reflective of what's happening in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "And sometimes the relaxation of that area can really support the mind to relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Another support for relaxing the mind is really to soften the face."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "The face kind of give way to the pull of gravity."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "No need to be concerned about an expression."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Just letting the brow, the eyes, the mouth, the cheeks, the jaw all soften and relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Maybe the mind can let go of pulls of worries, concerns about the past and the future."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "And again coming back to opening to your experience more generally."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "What's available? What's obvious in your experience right now? Settling back and not looking necessarily, but seeing what is coming to you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "What sensations, what experience you could almost say is asking to be known, is asking for connection, being available to your body and mind to receive what it's saying, what it's communicating."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You don't need to have any ideas or views about what should be there."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "What is there? What's available? Might be physical sensation, body, breath, hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Might be emotions or moods or thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Let's hear this organism expressing itself through life, through sensation and the amazing quality of the organism to be aware of that, to be consciously aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Of course the habits of mind will pull us away from this connection to our bodies and minds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Yet the amazing piece is that at some point that capacity of awareness will re-arrive and we will become aware again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You don't have any say over that it happens, it's natural that it happens, the condition of encouraging it, of being aware of it, of noticing it when it comes in, encourages it, it creates the conditions for it to happen more and more."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "And so when awareness re-arises, just noticing that out here, aware again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "What is awareness receiving? What is it connecting to? As we become aware, what are we aware of? Well, sometimes in that re-arising of awareness, whatever had been happening kind of has a little bit of a pull to it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "It feels like a niggle or a tickle."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "I need to think about that or seeing if you can notice that kind of pull."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Mind yourself of the benefit and the power of just opening to this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "That thing may have its time later in your day, but right now, seeing if you can set that aside and just be with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "That may mean being with some resonance of emotion or body sensation that has come in while the mind was thinking, and that's fine."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "Being with what's here, being with what's asking for attention, and seeing if you can let go of the content of the thought and all of these words, you can just let them go now and incline towards just simple awareness of this being here now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "This is taking in how you are in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Whatever is easily available to know in your experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Like starting in the meditation just from where you are, acknowledging, connecting with whatever is present right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Seeing if that connection with whatever is obvious or whatever is present right now can be held in a way that is curious, interested, and not judgmental."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Just acknowledging what is here, just receiving it, allowing it to be as it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "I often find at the beginning of a period of meditation it is helpful to start with acknowledging how I am because if I jump in right away and start trying to be with a breath, I often will miss some subtle or not so subtle even energy or holding or attention that is actually asking to be seen held in this space of kind attention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Whatever is here has arisen because of conditions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "And opening to that, opening to that with mindfulness, without the judgment in there without a judgmental attitude about what is here, it is kind of like a way to really hold ourselves with kindness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Whatever is here belongs, whatever is here can be met."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "This attitude of allowing what is here to be here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Kind attention, loving awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Allowing is an expression of love for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Full opening to allowing what is here to be here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "And as we come into that attitude perhaps of kind attention, it may be helpful for it can be helpful to orient towards a kind attention of the body and breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "One of the most obvious areas of our experience in a place which our body holds so much of the stress and suffering of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Holding it with this kind attention can allow it not to be exacerbated but actually can."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It's like holding it in a warm embrace or a friendly connection."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "We have such an attitude or a habit of getting things done or doing things right."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "And for this time there is full permission to just be yourself and be with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Not judging it or condemning it or holding on."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Be with your breath as it is showing up."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "You don't have to look at the breath to dive into it to figure out any details about it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Just what's a hobbyist? And Buddha encouraged us to when breathing in, just know we're breathing in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "You What is arising in this moment, whether it's bodily experience, whether there's the awareness of the breath or feelings or hearing the teachings of the Buddha encouraged us, the Buddha's teachings on mindfulness encouraged us to know it just as experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "In this perspective, Buddha used the phrase being aware of the body as a body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "As moods or states of mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It might sound like that's cold or clinical, but the experience of that is very intimate, connected."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "The idea of it as my body, something I need to do something with or fix or change."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "All of that extra thoughts about it being my body, what I need to do about it, is in the way of that intimacy."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It separates us from our direct meeting of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "And so while that phrase, being with the body as a body may sound kind of cold or clinical, the experience of attending in that way has this quality of friendliness, of loving attention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "And so exploring in your meditation this perspective of allowing what's here to be here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "You're welcome to attend to your experience in whatever way you're most familiar with."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Remembering this allowing perspective."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Whatever is arising and being known can be known as experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Come to the third talk in this five-part series."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "I've called it Finding Our Way, and Finding Our Way with these different pairs of states that we can experience that sometimes exist in relationship to each other and sometimes can exist independent of each other."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Sometimes can be healthy and sometimes can be unhealthy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And today the pairing is that of joy and despair."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And for me, when I think of the joy that I've kind of been awoken in me through this Buddhist practice, I think of it as a big yes, yes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And even not knowing what I'm saying yes to, I mean I'm not saying yes to anything, it's just the idea of a yes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "That something brightens inside of me, opens and delights me with joy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And that in that regard then despair is this no, oh no, kind of a giving up, a kind of deflation, a kind of drop in loss of energy, sinking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "A feeling of maybe hopelessness or great disappointment or great sense of fear of what might come."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so this yes movement and this no movement that can exist together."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "A little bit like yesterday, the gladness and the sadness, that joy can come from hope."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And when hope is dashed, it can bring a lot of despair or there is no hope, it can bring a lot of despair."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But one of the strong associations with these two has to do with purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "That when we have a clear sense of healthy purpose, that there can be a kind of a yes to that, the kind of our system, our being, it gets involved in doing it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And when there's no sense of purpose or the purpose seems hopeless or is not working out or we can't engage in it, then there can be despair about not fulfilling this purpose that's important for us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And the question is what is the purpose we have? Is it a valuable, healthy purpose? There can be joy in the engagement and doing of things which are unhealthy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You know, you can really fully be immersed in eating only desserts for lunch and for dinner, just completely engaged."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And the concentration, the absorption, everything else in the world falls away because it's just dessert."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And the joyful can have a feeling of the engagement is so nice, but it might not be healthy for you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And there might be things that are healthy to do, but the way that we engage in it is not healthy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "We might do it with resentment, with reluctance, hesitation, and we don't really give ourselves over to doing it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So maybe we can't be successful and they're doing something half-hearted, but it's an important thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so we feel despair of something that's healthy that we do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So the sense of purpose, what do we have a purpose for? What's the intention? It's a very important part of human life and it's a valuable thing to do in a spiritual life is to spend time reflecting on the purpose, the intention, the reasons, the goals in which we have set ourselves up, what we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And this can set up then joy or despair, even wonderful, lovely, important, valuable spiritual dedications or purposes, meditation purposes can bring a lot of despair if we are unsuccessful in doing it, we don't reach what we're trying to do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "What I'd like to propose is that it's important to spend time reflecting on what our purposes are, whether it's the purpose is to cook a meal or clean the dishes, or the purpose is to develop our mature spiritually in our Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "These motivations, purposes are important to become clear about, so then we can inhabit the purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "We can really say yes to it and engage and hopefully it's a healthy purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And then have a sense of appropriateness of how we attain these purposes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "I mean, if you sit down and my purpose is to get enlightened, but first you don't even know how to do breath meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Maybe first you need to learn the basics of breath meditation and learn about the hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so the purpose, there's all these earlier purposes we have to inhabit and follow through on before we can attain the full ones."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So the sense of purpose I'm talking about here is not an abstract purpose, which might be some distant one, which might be important for us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But rather each step of what we do, how we engage in the moment in the direction of that purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So if the purpose is to be able to develop strong concentration, then engage fully for a while understanding your hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Without really becoming wise about the hindrances, you probably won't get reliably, healthily concentrated."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so engage in that process, study the hindrances, and that's the purpose, that's what we engage ourselves in."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So when we despair can come and we don't have a purpose, we don't have an engagement."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so this idea of joy and despair, which are healthy, are founded or based on a healthy sense of purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And then learning how to inhabit that purpose in the moment, doing in the moment what's appropriate for that purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Not sitting there kind of just daydreaming about a big purpose far in the future."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But if this purpose is important enough, what do I enter into and have it do now? And so for example, if now this idea of concentration, and I need to learn about the hindrances, so maybe the next step is to read about them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so then you would sit down in a way and really purposefully engage."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You wouldn't read a book or an article about the hindrances, like you would read a novel and just kind of as entertainment and just kind of be carried along to relax."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You would do it purposefully, engage in it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But not in a way that's stressful, of course, and this is where the art of all this is, but a way that brings you joy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "There's the art of doing, of engaging, that brings joy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And not a lot of people have learned this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "They've learned it in certain areas, certain things which are fun to do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "They can really enjoy doing that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But there's an art to learning how to do anything that you need to do in a joyful way, in a way that's a big yes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "It's like in doing it, it's so much good."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "If you have to clean the toilet today, the more senior monks in the Buddhist monasteries in Japan, they're assigned to the task of toilet cleaning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And maybe because they have the spiritual maturity to really do it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So you have to clean the toilet."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So maybe you don't like it, it's a little bit gross, and so you do it like half-heartedly."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But to do it fully, just really, if this is what you're doing, this is your life energy, for this moment, just clean the toilet."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Do it as if it's everything, it's the whole."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Just give yourself to a yes to doing that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "What I'm teaching you today is a lot of what I learned through Zen training."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Where if you sweep the courtyard, you really, that's what you do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You give yourself over to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Toilets, whatever you're doing, you give yourself to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And the surprise of it is that it's possible to learn to really feel sense of joy and delight and happiness and just giving ourselves over to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Even if you're sick and don't have much energy, then what is giving yourself over? Really do something with purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "What does it look like given the conditions of your life if you're sick or in pain? Whatever the circumstances are, the sense of doing is in harmony with the circumstance, with yourself and the world around you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But this is what you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "It can be overdone, it can be done with stress, so you're exhausted at the end."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And we can learn the art of doing that it's fully there, but we're relaxed in doing it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So this art of appreciating the value of what we're actually doing while we're doing it can be a source of tremendous joy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And that kind of joy can grow."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And part of the despair that people can experience is when they have no sense of purpose, when the purpose they had for their life kind of gets shattered, or they're unsuccessful in the purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Purpose is very important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so the relationship between purpose and fulfilling a purpose, engaging in a purpose, and your joy and despair is something to reflect on and look at and consider."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And certainly knowing you're doing something that's wonderfully and meaningful for you and purposeful can be a source of joy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "But if it's only abstract in the head, the evaluation of it, oh, I'm doing something wonderful, then you're missing where the juice is, where the real heart is of this practice of mindfulness and the way it can really grow in us, grow for our life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And that is give yourself to the purpose of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Give yourself to the whatever bigger purpose you have if you're pursuing it or engaged in it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And what is the steps in the moment? So, I mean, just to make the point in this silly little example, say that the purpose is to, a big purpose to develop concentration and meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You've heard now that reading about the hindrances and learning about them and understanding them well is a very important stepping stone for concentration."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So now you, but now you don't have a book on the hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So you go to the library to get one, the town library."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so now walking to the library, driving to the library, biking to the library, that's the task of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You forget about going to the library."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You set the course to go there and now you give yourself over to the going to the library."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "When you get to the library, and this is how it works in a monastery, when you open the library door, you give yourself over to opening that door."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You give yourself walking down the aisles, finding the book."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And so it's the doing where something really important comes up, the doing things in a purposeful way, intentional way, so that you find joy in it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "I'm not suggesting this is easy, but it's possible to live a life of yes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And if the purpose is valuable and you find this kind of value in happening, engaging in what you're doing, then it doesn't matter if you're successful so much."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "You might fail at things, but you're so happy about the way you did it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "It was rewarding the way you did it was rewarding."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And if you're successful or not successful, your joy, happiness, and well-being is less dependent eventually on the success or failure, but in how you do it, did it, how you were involved with what you did."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So for today, I've maybe given you lots to think about and to engage in for the day, but to maybe make key points."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "What role does purpose have in your life? And have you dismissed the value of purpose? Can you find a sense of purpose? Purpose doesn't have to be big purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "It could be the small purpose of the next five minutes, the next hour."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "What's the purpose you have? And then the yes of engaging in purpose in the step-by-step ways, the small steps it takes, whatever purpose it is, not to be ahead of yourself from the activity of the moment, the individual steps to get there, and to find how a yes in engagement in the steps to whatever you're doing, the purpose, that that is purposeful as well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Finding purpose in how you do things is one of the great joys and secrets of a well-developed life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "And it all supports your practice, your mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "It's a way of manifesting your mindfulness into our life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "I hope you find a delightful day with yes to whatever you're doing and exploring your sense of purpose."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And it's wonderful that technology allows us to be together in this way, in this wonderful way of people around California, perhaps other places."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And just to welcome you would be lovely to just for you to unmute yourself and maybe say a quick hello and where you are calling in from tonight."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm at home in Mountain View, California."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm in Berkeley, California."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm in Redwood City, California."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm in Santa Cruz, California."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm calling from Probo, Utah."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Hello, Abraham from Palo Alto."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Hi, it's Barry in Washington, DC."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Welcome from the East Coast."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So I will start and just to let you know, we're also trying live streaming on YouTube, but only my video."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "My video is visible for privacy reasons."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So your voice will be heard as if you were at IMC and you were taking the mic, but your face, even though you can see each other in gallery view, but it's not on YouTube."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Just to let you know in case you're wondering how this is all being cobbled together tonight, but you're welcome to switch to gallery view and see each other, which is quite lovely to see each other."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So I'd like to start and I'm going to mute everyone just in case there is background noise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And for tonight's practice together, the theme that I'd like to share is practicing equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The Brahma Vihara of equanimity in challenging times."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So equanimity is one of the four Brahma Viharas and the Brahma Viharas are often translated as the heavenly abodes, really the home of our heart."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And those four, the first one is Metta, Loving Kindness, which we practice a lot."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "That's our go-to in this tradition, which is a sense of goodwill, warmth, care for other beings that we try to cultivate, not just for other beings, but for ourselves, 360, including ourselves, a sense of kindness and care."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The second one of the four Brahma Viharas, heavenly abodes, is compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So when goodwill meets suffering in the world, it expresses itself as a sense of compassion, care, concern for suffering, whether it's ours or others."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The third of the Brahma Viharas is vicarious joy, when this goodwill, Metta, number one, meets good fortune in the world and happiness and joy arises."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And it could be happiness and joy for others, or it may be gratitude for ourselves if we are feeling a sense of uplift for our own good fortune."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The fourth is equanimity, which is what we'll be practicing in happy hour tonight together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And equanimity, also translated as equipoise, is the practice of one way to think about it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Actually, the word upeka itself, the word upeka in Pali, can be translated as having a bird's eye view."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Having a bird's eye view of everything that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So the opposite of equanimity would be if you have just a narrow view of a tunnel vision and you're really stuck in seeing things in a very limited particular way."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whereas equanimity, if you were actually had a bird's eye view and really saw all the causes and conditions of what is happening and what's arising and passing in the world, there would be a sense of ease and openness of having this expansive, spacious view of what's arising and passing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And it's important to say that equanimity sometimes, erroneously, it arises for people the sense of being aloof."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "That couldn't be further from the truth."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "In fact, aloofness or not caring is considered to be what's translated as the near enemy."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I like actually the word masquerader."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So aloofness can masquerade as equanimity, but it's not equanimity, it's not caring."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Equanimity is a sense of warmth."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It has warmth and care in it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Otherwise, it wouldn't have been lumped with the other Brahma Viharas."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So there is a sense of care."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "There is so much care that actually there is a sense of stable presence."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "If there was no care, you wouldn't be present."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whereas the act of actually caring and being with is an act of care, is an act of holding witness, an act of being with in a way, in a spacious way."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And also to say another way equanimity relates to the other Brahma Viharas, the other three is that it forms the foundation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It really forms the foundation without equanimity, without the sense of spaciousness and balance, equipoise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The other three would veer into their opposites or their near enemies."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "For example, metta, instead of being love and care, without attachment, without expectation of return or expectation of any outcome."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It would become attached love if there was no equanimity and spaciousness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It would be, I have metta for you, if you have metta for me, I'm going to wish well for you so that you will do this thing for me."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So it will become conditional instead of being free and really having a sense of ease."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Another way that I like to think and invite you to consider equanimity, besides spaciousness and airiness, openness of view, is to feel into it as a stability."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So there's a sense of stability that you're not knocked over and actually embodiment, which we will do at the beginning of the guided meditation tonight."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "A sense of embodiment really helps with a sense of stability."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And you can think that if you're sitting on a bedrock, you know, the same way that, say, a statue of Kwan Yin is stable, or the Buddha sitting on a platform of stability."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "That sense of stability allows the unmoving for you to be with things as they arise and as they pass, not being knocked over."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So with that, as preamble, what I'd like to invite us in the guided meditation would be first an invitation to stabilize, arrive in our bodies with a breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And then move into the formal practice of equanimity and offer some phrases."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And of course it perhaps doesn't need any mention, but the practice of equanimity is very supportive in this crazy, unprecedented, challenging time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whether you're personally affected and we're actually, I take that back, given that you're personally affected, we are all personally affected."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Every single one of us in different levels and amounts, our hearts, our minds, our bodies are affected."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And we are concerned for people that we care about and love, as well as all beings everywhere sharing concern for our whole planet and all beings on this planet."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So the practice of equanimity, which again is not aloofness, and you'll see as we practice together, can really support the sense of stability going through difficulty, living through challenging times with stability, with grace, with stability, and without turning away, without being stably here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So with that, I'd like to invite you to get into your meditation pose, whether you're sitting on a chair or a cushion, or whether you like to move, you need to move right now to make yourself more comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "This is the perfect time to do that, and I'm going to move and sit cross-legged on my chair, which is more comfortable for me, and take a sip of water since I've been talking."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I will mute everyone in case of background noise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So it's not personal, it's just because of the background noise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, as you are sitting, sitting, or perhaps even lying down if that's a more comfortable position for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Arriving, arriving in your chair, arriving in a cushion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Landing in this body in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Connecting with the sensations of this body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Contacting the floor, your feet, your legs, your bottom."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Sense of connection being connected to the earth via your chair or cushion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Taking your seat with integrity in this humanness."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Things are as they are right now."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "For some people, the shorter version of it is what it is is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Alternatively, may I be at peace or may I accept, may I be undisturbed by the comings and going of events with equanimity and balance?

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "You are welcome to choose whatever variation that works for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "This can be a creative practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "May I meet the comings and goings of events with stability and spaciousness? Or back to the first one, no matter how I might wish, no matter how I might wish things to be otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Things are as they are right now."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It is like this right now."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Before we move to practice and communities and connecting, which is particularly important these days, particularly important, I just want to ask, maybe popcorn style on muting yourself and saying how you feel right now, what word is coming up for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm going to say resilient again."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "A revealing and surprising calm."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Reflection and health of everyone."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "That's what everybody is in for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "We'll move into a brief time for connection and sharing and the sense of embodiment and stability that you have through this practice through the guided meditation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The invitation is to continue with that to continue to tap in and feel into this stability."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And to feel the body as you will be speaking in the groups."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So in a sense of warmth and care because you'll be holding presence for others."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "You won't be turning away thinking about what you're going to say, what you're going to do."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So you showing up for each other in the small groups in a moment is an act of equanimity with care you're going to show up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And whatever arises you will hold witness to and for yourself too."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whatever arises for you holding with spaces and send with a sense of integrity and stability."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So we'll be in groups of three."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And each person will have a couple of minutes to share."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I will broadcast in the rooms."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And so it's briefed less than 10 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "The whole thing would be maybe eight minutes or so setting up etc."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And yeah, a sense of connecting with these other beautiful people who are joining us from various places in the world."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And the prompt is how are you? How are you? And you can take that as how are you right now after this meditation? And if you wish you can also make it more general."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whatever calls to you, whatever comes out of your mouth is the right thing to say, how are you right now? And other people will holding space, not interrupting, not asking questions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "How are you? How are you? Okay."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So with that, I'm going to create the breakout rooms."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Let me look at the breakout rooms."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I think they are all, there's, all right."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Let me, I need to do some adjusting here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I think that's going to work."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Look at it one more time, going once, going twice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So and one room is going to have four people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I think it's all good."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I believe everyone should be back from the, from the rooms."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I think we're going to have a, a few reflections about the practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "What came up for you and also questions about the continuity practice and this challenging time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So you can raise your hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I physically, I may not see you raising hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "But you can raise your hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "By clicking the three dots on your name and raising your hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "If the technology doesn't work for you, then try to raise your hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So any questions or reflections, please."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It also works if you just press the space bar while you talk."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "No reflections whatsoever."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Well, it was obvious that in, in, in our group, we're all dealing with a lot."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "We're all dealing with a lot and we are managing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "We have to manage and find ways how to cope."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So the acknowledgement that it is a challenging time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And me wishing it to be otherwise is not going to make it otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And what kind of resources to actually to, to acknowledge the resources that you have to cope to, to accept things as they are, which is a practice of equanimity instead of fighting reality."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And that was a beautiful, beautiful meditation that you, that you provided for us this evening."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Any questions, any comments? What, what did you notice either in the guided meditation or in the group practice together, holding space for each other? Oh, Barry, your hand is up please."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So yeah, thank you for the guided meditation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I went to the retreat on Saturday and that was the first time I had heard about equanimity practice and lo and behold, that's tonight's topic."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I am excited about incorporating elements of that into my regular daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I for years would say the serenity prayer over and over to myself and it would calm me down."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And it had like a powerful effect on me."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I think I'm going to use that to be part of my equanimity practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "My core practice is with the breath, but I want to use the two together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "But yeah, I was dealing with a dullness and torpor during the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And yeah, I'm glad to be here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I, the other person, I'll let her speak for herself."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "But yeah, we just talked about sort of what the meditation was like and what we thought of equanimity practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And thanks for hanging in here, given that it's three hours later where you are."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It's almost 10 pm So yeah."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And the serenity prayer, I think that's another way of really tapping into the same concept of equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So whatever works for you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Buddhism has a lot to offer."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And there's so many traditions that it's basically this is part of our humanity, human family, the way to face and being with challenging times."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So whatever wording works for you, by all means."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Thanks for bringing that up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Trudy, you have unmuted yourself."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "You wanted to say something, or? Oh, I think this is a perfect time for me to practice equanimity, because again, connecting it to the serenity prayer, there's so much that we can't change and things that we can."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "But that wisdom to know the difference is always crucial and difficult."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, yeah, I like that idea of wedding the serenity prayer to equanimity as a practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Can I say something? Sure, Abraham, please."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Okay, what we talked about in our group was ways and means that we had been using resources to help us through difficult times and obviously the stuff online at IMC has been a real benefit for a lot of people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "One person had had a bicycle accident and so was shocked to see that, that as they were getting better, they didn't understand why everybody else was freaking out because they were feeling better."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So that was a nice wrinkle on that."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I kind of had the same thing happen."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I was on that online retreat that IMC had with the deepening meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So I just continued being on retreat after it was over."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So I've been on retreat now for some time."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I find that most of the time I'm really, really enjoying or appreciating where it is that I am at."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And every now and then there's these moments where I freak out over something and then go back to, I guess, equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So that's been the experience, that's what we were doing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "In the last minute left, anyone has had any questions about equanimity seems, does it seem like aloofness for you? Any questions about that? That sometimes comes up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "That feels like, oh, you're just giving up and saying, oh, things are as they are."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "For anyone, did it feel like that? If it did, let's talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "If it did, please raise your hand."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm not getting any takers."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So it seemed like for folks, actually I'm going to pause for one moment just to make sure because it's important to talk about that."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "If it's veering into aloofness for anyone or a sense of resignation, which it's not supposed to be."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "It may not, this may not be to your question."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Actually, I'm going to pause."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "If it's not about aloofness, I'm going to give that one more beat because if anyone has that, I just want to make sure they feel comfortable to bring it up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "You know, usually during the happy hour, right, there is, we can ask to think of one person that, you know, that comes to mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "But today it was like everybody, you know, I was, I was wishing everybody to be happy and healthy and safe."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "You know, like so many people were coming to, coming to mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "I'll offer just a very few words to support settling in, starting by taking in how you are in this moment, just opening to how the body is, without judgment, without resistance, without holding on to anything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just how are you? How's the body? How's the mind? And seeing if there can be just an allowing of how you are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes as we become aware of what's already happening, we've not been fully aware of it and we become aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes there can be a little bit of a shift or some space connected with what's here, if it's a little bit of a struggle, and if it's something lovely or uplifting, sometimes it can brighten the mind to actually become aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So just taking in how you are and noticing if being aware of it, with an allowing stance, has an effect."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Then recognizing that we are sitting here and connecting to the present moment with intention, remembering that it can be really helpful to see if there can be some relaxation of body, relaxation of mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe scanning through the body and just checking in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Or might there be tension? Can it be softened? Can it be relaxed? Sometimes we can consciously relax parts of the body when we notice there's tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And sometimes we can kind of just play with this too, seeing if there can be in this light, gentle scanning through the body when there's an acknowledgement of a place that may be a little tense."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And what happens as that tension is met with that gentle awareness? Sometimes bringing that kind of soft, friendly attention can allow there to be a releasing, not a releasing that we're consciously doing, but when that happens because the tension is held, it's not resisted, it's not squeezed on, it's just known."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes that kind of awareness can very naturally create the conditions for releasing that tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Not always, just exploring that possibility."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then ask the body and mind maybe have a little more relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Opening to whatever is obvious, whatever is most naturally known, whatever, is naturally already aware of perhaps having the stance of receiving experience rather than choosing what to attend to, settling back and seeing what wants to be known, what wants to be seen, what wants to be attended to."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes what wants to be known or what's already, most easily known is something very specific, a particular body sensation or sound, the mood or a thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And sometimes what is kind of most wanting to be known is something more vague, a sense of being or ease or agitation perhaps, not a specific precise experience but much more of a diffuse experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Knowing that kind of diffuse experience is much easier when the mind is more relaxed, receptive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And for some of you it may be more natural or easeful rather than stepping back and being out of the driver's seat, just receiving."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "For some of you it may feel more easeful to pick something simple like the breath or the body and allow the attention to kind of land there and if that feels more easeful for you, please explore that landing with that area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then maybe you can explore receiving that experience, receiving the breath or receiving the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "In our mindfulness practice we are opening to this present moment's experience and there's so much happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's fine to pick a particular section of the present moment experience and it's fine to open and just receive from a broader field of attention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "In this particular case we are exploring, being aware of being alive in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Exploring being aware of the only thing we can ever be aware of."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What's happening right now?."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "This meditation will be in two parts."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "We'll just settle at the beginning and then right at the end I'll come in with a little bit of a, um, some suggestions for attending to particular aspect of experience, the feeling tone, which is the topic for the, for the talk today."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "But we'll just start with the kind of settling as usual."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Start, it can be helpful to start by just acknowledging where and how you are just here, in this place and time, in this body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "I'm just taking in how you are right now and no judgment, but just kind of like taking inventory."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Is the body tense or relaxed? Is the mind agitated or at ease? And just, just acknowledge that and see if there can just be a, okay, that's how it is right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Just kind of starting there with awareness of how you are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Then a condition that supports our capacity to be present, our capacity to be aware, is relaxation of body and mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And having checked in, you may notice, you may know or recognize that their particular aspects or areas of tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And if you have noticed that, you might just explore the possibility of relaxing the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe even a possibility of relaxing inside the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Sometimes that's a place where there's physical tension that's held."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And if we attune to that area, sometimes it can soften."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "If we attune to it with the intention of relaxing, so maybe the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe the stomach and intestines can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe too the mind can relax, letting go perhaps of worries, concerns about the past or the future, setting them aside for now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe too as an analogy for relaxing the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Sometimes it can be helpful, as Gil suggests, maybe the brain can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "This relaxation connecting to the conditions that support the meditation and clining towards relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "You could say as kind of a setting up a container for the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "With that relaxation, perhaps you can recognize that you're aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "First, aware of whatever is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe aware of how relaxed or tense the body is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Just aware of what's here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Often body sensation is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "In the past weeks, we've been exploring awareness of body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "So maybe there's awareness of sensations in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Often a very obvious aspect of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe the pressure, the hips are contacting, the chair, cushion, bench."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe sensations of feet or hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe a broader sense of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "What is the actual experience that's happening in the physical experience? In talking about what I've just said, the contact points, the contact, the place where the hands and feet touch, the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "All of that is known through actual sensations."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe you can touch into the sensation level of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "The pressure, wherever it's obvious, whatever experience in the physical realm is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe you're noticing pressure of hardness or softness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe you're tingling or vibration, pulsing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe movement if you're attending to the breath, expansion, contraction."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe moisture or dryness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "What is the actual experience happening in the present moment? In this way, touching into essentially how our physical body communicates."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It doesn't communicate the physical body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It doesn't communicate through concepts of hand or foot or even breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It communicates through sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Can you know the sensations that are happening right now? You're welcome to just be attending to whatever is obvious for you in the physical body right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "With a breath, if that's more comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "You don't have to go digging for knowing what the sensations are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Just whatever kind of is most clear what's coming to you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Going to relaxation and a receiving of these sensations."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Of course, the mind will wander or get lost in thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "At some point, equally, naturally, the mindfulness will return and you'll become aware again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "In that moment, when we become aware again, often we become aware that we've been lost in thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "We become aware of that because we're aware of something here now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "So can that be the curiosity? What's here now? Sometimes after the mind wandering in thought, there is sometimes a tension that creeps back in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "If that has happened, it can be really helpful to not try to jump back to where you were when the mind wandered, whatever you were paying attention to before the mind wandered."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's allowing a relaxation of body and mind, taking a few moments to allow that relaxation again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "With that relaxation, the mind relaxes again, it supports awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "What are you aware of? I'm going to see actual experience that you're aware of."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "We'll sit together in silence for some time and I'll come back in towards the end."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "In the last few minutes, I'd like to explore a little bit around the feeling tone of experience in your practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "So just allowing your attention to connect with whatever is the most obvious physical sensation in your experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe new attending to the quality of that experience as we were doing before, the hardness, the pressure, vibration or tingling, heat or coolness, whatever that is for just a moment, letting yourself take that in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And then what is the flavor of the experience in terms of pleasant, unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, neutral quality? Maybe obvious or not so obvious, just seeing if you can recognize whether that experience is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And as you know that aspect of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, does it get stronger or weaker or stay the same? And you may notice perhaps along with the quality of pleasant or unpleasant, sometimes with neutral also, that there's a response to that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And as pleasant, we often like it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And as unpleasant, we often don't like it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "That's happening, just acknowledging that, okay, it's unpleasant and not liking is happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's pleasant and liking, appreciating, delighting in is happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "There's a difference between the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral quality and the response to it, just seeing if that can be recognized."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Relax as you explore this, again, it's what can be received rather than trying to dig."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Letting go of that for now, for the last minute or so of the sitting, just letting the attention kind of float freely to whatever it's drawn to in the physical experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And see if you can be curious about whether what it's drawn to has a pleasant quality, an unpleasant quality, or a neutral quality."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And then for the last little bit of the sitting, just the last few seconds, I'd like to invite you to allow the corners of your mouth to turn up in a half smile and see what happens to the feeling tone of your experience as you do that."}

How is the mind? What's our mood like right now? Do we feel sleepy, alert, we feel cheerful, scattered, depressed, excited? How is it? There's no right or wrong mood, just as with the body, there's no wrong place to start."}

{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Our Buddhist meditation has many facets, many different purposes, it can be useful, many different methods."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "But of all of these, the most central qualities, the most essential benefit that we can derive from Buddhist practice, meditation, is to draw upon some of the intrinsic qualities of mind and to develop them."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "The mind has the capacity to be awake, to be aware, to know."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "We can use meditation to consciously cultivate that quality of wakefulness, alertness, bringing attention to this present reality."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "The mind also has the capacity for peacefulness, for steadiness, a quality of calm, focused attention."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "The mind can rest, be fully focused on one thing upon this present reality, with peace, serenity, complete ease."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "For these are natural qualities of the mind, their attributes of the mind, and they can be developed, strengthened, brought to a full fruition."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "A mind and body relate to each other very closely, with a very deep, direct connection."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "How the body is affects the mind, how the mind is affects the body."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "They work together, at the lungs and the heart, the stomach and your liver, it's a different faculties that function very much in relationship to each other, they work together."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "So if we wish to establish, develop a mind which is alert and awake, then how we hold the body, what we do with the body affects that."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Bringing attention then to the spine, feeling the presence of your backbone, invite your body to sit in an upright, alert way, to let the spine, to invite the spine to stretch to its full, comfortable limit, not to be tense or rigid or uptight, but just letting the body grow, lengthen, stretch till the spine is full, comfortable, natural limit."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "As the spine lengthens, grows, stretches in this way, notice how immediately that lends a quality of a greater alertness, sense of energy and brightness of mind, helps us to wake up, even just a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Leaving the presence of the spine as the center, the axis of our physical world, then we invite the rest of the body to relax, to soften around that, to be free of tension, to settle."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "I just as the lengthening and stretching of the spine encourages alertness and awareness, and the relaxation of the body, the softening of the muscles in your face, shoulders, your belly, your legs, and encourages the quality of peacefulness, of calm."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Now first of all bring attention to the feelings in your face, your forehead, around your eyes, your mouth, notice any feelings of tension, rigidity, tightness there, let those muscles relax, give yourself permission to let the muscles of the face be soft, restful, let the tension around your eyes and your mouth soften, dissolve away."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "As the muscles relax, notice that there is an effect upon the mood, the eyes and the jaw, the mouth soften, relax."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Does this have an impact on the mind's feeling of ease or calm, how is it, what is the effect of that relaxation, and letting the attention flow down through the body, moving gently down our neck into our shoulders, notice the sensations that are there as we bring attention to that area, the shoulders soften, relax, drop down a notch or two, often we go through life with our back tense and hunched shoulders up around our ears, we are in a safe place, surrounded by good people, there is nothing we have to be worried about, nothing we have to generate tension, stress about, your shoulders relax, your arms hang easily loosely by your sides, and letting his wave of relaxation then gently continue to flow down, your left arm and your right arm, relaxing them too, whether you have your hands in your lap or in your knees or wherever you choose to have them is not important the exact way we hold them, let the arms and hands be free of any kind of tension and tightness."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Feeling the trunk of the body, your chest, your stomach, solar plexus, the whole central core of our physical world, the shoulders drop back a little, the heart be more open, by yourself to breathe a little more easily, letting the stomach spreads, relax, soften, this is the opposite of the abs of steel program, this is the abs of jello, you can let your stomach spill out over the waist of your trousers or your skirt, no tension, relaxed, completely at ease."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Letting this wave flow down to the hip joints, the pelvis, letting your thighs, legs drop an inch or two, knees, lower legs, relaxing the whole lower part of the body, all the way down to our feet, to our toes, making friends with this body, this constant companion, this vehicle of our life, to relate to it in a friendly, kindly, compassionate way, giving it permission to rest, to settle, to be fully at ease."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "For the next few minutes, then let the attention sweep slowly up, down through the body, feeling out all the different corners, notice how the body has changed, sometimes when we are engaged in relaxing our legs, our hip joints, our eyes have scrunched up again, our jaws tightened, and while we are relaxing our jaw, our eyes, then the stomach has gone rigid once more, let it take the next couple of minutes to slowly, steadily, gently sweep the attention through the body, and wherever you find that tension or tightness has reasserted itself, let the mind rest at that spot, invite the body to soften, to be free of tension once again, so we are holding the whole body within awareness, accepting it as it is, feeling its presence, knowing it, accepting it."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "The mind in its pure state, the mind free of greed, hatred and delusion, is both perfectly awake, energetic, bright, and completely peaceful, completely relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "In the ordinary way of thinking of things, we think of peace or relaxation as being curled up in a heap on the sofa, snoozing on a long and lazy weekend, alertness we associate with negotiating with the traffic on highway 17, going to a scary movie, and something's exciting, frightening, irritating, the mind is alert."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "But beneath all that, behind all those superficial reactions, conditioned reactive habits of mind, the very fundamental nature of mind at its basis, is both alertness and total peacefulness, working together, coexisting, not conflicting."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "As we establish this quality within the posture, the body both energetic and upright, fully relaxed, that supports the realisation, the embodiment of those qualities on the mental level as well."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "It helps us to find those aspects of mind that are also both completely peaceful, completely awake."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Our mind's tendency is to drift, we remember things, we anticipate things, we hear sounds and create trains of thoughts and stories triggered by what we hear, what we remember, what we imagine, the mind drifts into agitation, and the other direction drifts into sleepiness, things are quiet and still, serene, next thing we know we dozed off, nothing interesting nothing exciting, so click, we switch off, therefore it's important for us to notice that drift, maybe for a moment we find we're able to sustain that beautiful balance of alertness and peacefulness, and then we drift, the mind dozes off, shuts down, find ourselves drooping over the spine no longer straight, the head have fallen forwards, the mind's gone into a dull, heavy nebulous, sleepy state."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Or it's drifted into agitation, body tense, rigid, the mind busy, planning, thinking, worrying, remembering, so we use ways to notice that drift, the most simple and straightforward way of seeing that happen, catching it as it begins, is to focus the attention on a single object, to take a simple neutral reference point, there are many different things one can use, a mental image or a mantra word, different ideas, like loving kindness, but the most simple and accessible, usable for most people, is to simply focus the attention on the natural rhythm of your breathing, breath is always with us, the body breathes on its own, there's no thing that we have to will on a personal level, the body does it by itself, awake, asleep, keeps breathing, breath is not exciting, so it takes effort to bring attention to it, but that application of effort helps to brighten, strengthen the quality of awareness, bringing attention to your breathing then, not trying to change it or fix it, do anything with it, you don't have to breathe in a special way, long or deep, short, let the breath come and go as it chooses, set that pattern of feeling, the in breath, the out breath, set that right at the center of your attention, it's like being at the very heart of a mandala, put the breath right at the very center of attention, for these next few minutes, make the resolution, right now there's nothing I need to plan, nothing I need to remember, nothing I need to figure out, no problems I need to solve, all of that can wait at least 10 or 15 minutes, the world can wait, consciously put everything else aside, set the intention to focus on the rhythm of the breathing, feeling the in breath, beginning to its end, the out breath, from its beginning to its end, very quickly many of us have been practicing this kind of meditation for many years, some of us are completely new to it, by the way very quickly we'll notice that the mind obeys orders for a very brief period, then up pops the thought and the attention gets pulled away, we drift off into a memory, find ourselves getting sleepy, so by having a clear reference point we can notice when that drift begins, if you're off planning next week that means you're not on the breath, you're hearing somebody snoring very close by, that might be you, we bring attention to the breathing, simply so that it's a marker, a reference point to see the coming and going of each moment, as the mind is pulled away, distracted by thoughts and feelings, moods, as I was saying yesterday we don't want to make the mind into the enemy or a problem that we have to fight against, but rather like working, training a young child, gently, firmly, we put the crayon in her hand, hold her hand in ours and make the shape of the letters, gently, firmly, calmly, when the mind runs off and gets carried away, gently, patiently, gather it back in, ready to begin again endlessly, so we're learning how to work with the nature of the mind, its habits and character, rather than setting up an opposition against it, seeing the mind get carried away, notice that, let go, letting go, then bringing the attention back to the very center, back to the feeling of the breath once again, to train ourselves to notice, distraction is like this, letting whether this is the first time we've ever sat on a retreat or done this kind of meditation, whether we've been doing this for decades, maybe we've heard these kind of instructions a thousand times, ten thousand times, whether it's very familiar or completely new, it's up to us to make use of this moment, how is the mind right now, how's the body, can hear the instructions and go, oh yeah, right, great, three seconds later, back into our streams of habit, whether it's all familiar or completely unfamiliar, somewhere in between, it's up to us, each one of us, to take responsibility, how we use this moment, how is the body right now, is it tense and rigid, is it flopped over and slumped, or is it balanced, alert, energetic, but relaxed, how is it, are we focused on the breath, or have we drifted somewhere else, how is it, no matter how many times we lose it, the attention gets carried away, snagged on the passing thought, like a burr getting caught on our socks, snagged and carried miles away, as soon as you notice, let go, unpick the burr, come back to the centre, if the mind gets frustrated and full of self criticism, oh it's just useless, my mind's all over the place, I'm a hopeless meditator, just notice that's the I'm the hopeless meditator thought, it arises, passes away, we don't have to believe it, we don't have to make much of it, this is more about learning how to lose it, how to recognise that drift, how to let go and begin again, it's more about learning to fail perfectly than to force the mind to behave in a certain way, we fail, we lose it, we notice, we let go, we begin again, fresh, open, nothing lost, just like all other wonky lines that a child makes when trying to draw the A's and B's and C's, they're not lost, they're not wasted, they're part of the learning process."}

{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "As soon as the I and me and mine, the ahankara, mamankara, I-making and mind-making is let go of, the experience of the present becomes far more clear, open, peaceful, free."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Even if what is being felt is a discomfort in the body or a afflicted emotion, a feeling of fear or jealousy, irritation, there's space around it, space within it."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "It's recognized as a pattern of nature, arising and passing away rather than me and mine or some personal attribute or some kind of personal possession."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "So as we sit for the next couple of minutes before the bell, just notice the habits of mind, the self-creating habits of mind."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "See if they can be let go of, not me anticipating the bell, but just awareness of anticipation."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "If we can notice that, see how that feels, what's the difference in quality and the experience of the present is not clouded, occluded by I and me and mine."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Even if it's just for half a second, notice how that is."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Just for a finger snap, that self-creation is interrupted."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "How is it? What is its quality? How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? We will do some walking meditation now for the next 45 minutes from 9."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Since this is the first retreat for some people and I can give a little description of walking meditation, this particular style of Thai forest tradition, the walking meditation method that we use is just to walk at an ordinary, gentle, natural pace."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "In fact, it's encouraged not to walk in slow motion, just to pretend that you're going for a stroll in the park, that you're not doing walking meditation, but just walking."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "And that framework of walking, we set up a stretch of ground that we got a nice area around us as Gil was pointing out, please don't go out on the roads or the lane, but in the area around the building or within the building, there's even a walking room next door and in the grounds around the building, in the woods, find a stretch of ground about 50-60 feet long, 70 feet long, so about 25 yards long if you can find a stretch of ground."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "And then to designate, okay, I walk from this rock to this tree and this wall to that wall and then make that the framework for the walking period."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "So just as sitting on the mat, sitting on the cushion, this is our framework for the sitting meditation period."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "You designate this is my framework for the walking meditation period and try to find a walking path that doesn't cross anybody else's, so that you're not kind of going at right angles."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "You might think, why does he need to say that? But the experience has shown that the record I've seen is someone who chose a path that crossed three other peoples."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "It's like a quadrill, you know, this kind of military maneuvers."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "It was extraordinary, but it's not necessary."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "You've got plenty of room here, so please choose a path that doesn't collide or cross with somebody else's."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "And also there is probably a perfect path somewhere, but you don't need it."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Just find a good enough path rather than the perfect path."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "So once you've chosen a path to walk on, just stay with that for the period of time and even though it might not be the perfect one is over there somewhere, leave it be, the path you've chosen is definitely good enough."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "And so maybe I'll just give a little demonstration for whom this is all new."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm an alcoholic and an addict, among other things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "For our purposes, I'm an alcoholic and an addict."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I say that so that you know that I'm not teaching out of a book, although I do have a book as we all know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In fact, I can never remember what's in there, so it's one of the perils of either aging or smoking pot for too many years."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I've been teaching on this topic for probably about six years that it's been a regular thing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I'm easily bored, so to teach the same thing over and over is not acceptable for me."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So that's why I was just writing down some notes, because there were some thoughts about how I wanted to teach tonight."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Are there more chairs in here? Bring those chairs in here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You'll be taking my inventory the whole time if you're sitting there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's really a lot of space here, but anyway."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So this class series will be five weeks."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was calculating that I'll have to, if I'm going to cover the 12 steps, that'll be two and five seventh steps."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Somebody better with the math than I am, but it's between two and three steps a night."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So we'll see how that goes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There are certainly steps that I will be emphasizing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "My plan right now, as far as I'm going to plan, is that the first two weeks I'm going to cover steps one through three."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And there could be some bleed in there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And we'll also be teaching really introductory meditation instructions, which are pretty much the only meditation instructions there are, because it's really just starting at the beginning each time anyway."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Much like a writer or painter with a blank canvas, each time we sit down to meditate, we are faced with the same problem."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Certainly it's helpful if we've done it before, because we remember how we solved our last problem, because it's the same problem only it's different."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Did I mention that? So we'll have plenty of time to meditate and have questions about meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Typically an evening will be something like we'll meditate for half an hour."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We'll have questions until you run out of questions."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We'll have a little break."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then I'll talk about a step for a while."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then we'll either do an interactive exercise where you guys talk to each other, or we'll do more kind of just focus discussion about the step."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So just out of curiosity, how many people are here at IMC for the first time? Okay, that's actually a lower number than we often get."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is a wonderful spiritual home if you choose to make it such."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The founder, Gil Fransdale, is a great teacher."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I've practiced and studied with him, and always have learned a lot from being with him."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's also a remarkable place because it is completely supported by dhana, by generosity."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Dhana is the Buddhist word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's from the Pali language, which is the language of the ancient Buddhist scriptures."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's Pali and there's dhana, and I always think it's like some kind of song or something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I actually have written a song doing a shtick on that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But Pali, I guess there's like some old folk song, Pali."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Somebody probably remembers it anyway."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But they're not that, dhana and Pali."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "See, this is a problem with getting bored easily."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So a center that depends totally on dhana, very few centers do that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Most of them will charge you a fee to come that will cover the expenses of the center."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then we'll ask you to just give dhana for the teachers."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's the way it's done at Spirit Rock and many other centers."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The fact that Gil and this community have been able to support themselves and really quite comfortably on just generosity is a great testament to both him as a teacher and the community's sincerity of practice."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I would like to begin with some meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If you're sitting in a chair, best if you can sit with both feet on the floor or on something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So that you're not crossing your legs."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What's more important than the way you have your legs is the back."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And to sit in a way that you can be alert and the back can be straight without creating tension or rigidity in the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is the first kind of balance that we have to achieve in meditation is to be both alert and relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I guess actually before we get too far into this I'll just recommend that if anyone has a telephone with them they might want to turn it off or silence it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Easy to forget to do that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so gently closing your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This practice is based on mindfulness, just being aware of what is as the fundamental tool."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it can be helpful to notice right now what you're feeling."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What's your mood as you start the evening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Is there anything you brought with you, any concerns or stresses from the day."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Is your body tense or just asking yourself how you feel right now."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You can come up with a word or words or just feel into that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Meditation isn't some special activity that removes us from ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In fact it's just the opposite, it brings us closer to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If we try to ignore how we feel, it will only undermine our attempts at becoming quiet or present."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Now doing some conscious relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Relaxing the muscles in the face, the jaw, the eyes in the forehead."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Relaxing the shoulders, arms and hands."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Notice if the mind is drawn to sounds."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You can just notice sound."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Whatever becomes dominant in mindfulness, meditation, return ourselves to."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Turn towards it rather than trying to shut it out."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And coming back to the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "A place where a lot of emotions can get stuck."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And relaxing the legs and feet."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Having a sense of the whole body sitting here in the cushion or in the chair."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Can you feel the body as one thing? This one object."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Within that single object are a whole myriad of sensations."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We can experience the body as one thing and many things at the same time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Now starting to focus on the breath."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Feeling the breath at the nostrils as it enters the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then the chest and belly as they expand and contract and the air leaves the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And after feeling a few breaths like this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "See where it's easiest for you to feel the breath."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Either the nostrils or the belly."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And let that spot become your main focal point."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You might feel the air at the nostrils moving in and out."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "With the movement of the belly or chest."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Not controlling the breath itself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then seeing what that feels like."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And not trying to create some special experience or waiting for something to happen."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Just relaxing into this present moment of breathing, of breath."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It can be helpful to use some anchoring words to help you stay with the breath."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If you're following the breath at the nostrils, you can stay to yourself in, out as the air moves in and out."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Or if you're feeling the breath at the chest or belly rising, falling with the movement."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Or you can find your own words."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Letting the words be in the background as the sensations are in the foreground of your awareness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Letting the words be in the background of your awareness."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You can make a mental note thinking, thinking, or just silently acknowledge to yourself that you're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then gently come back to the breath, trying not to add a judgment or commentary."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then starting again by focusing on the sensations of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Relaxing, settling back into the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In the same way if the attention is caught by sound or some sensations in the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You don't have to push anything away."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Just come back to the breath."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What was that woman's name? I'm talking about going out in the forest and having a seat."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's what the Buddha taught."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "He said, go sit under a tree."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You're probably a reincarnated monk."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's definitely a different energy to sitting in nature."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If you're comfortable there, that's great."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's surprisingly, right? You think nature is quiet? It's not quiet at all."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then there's creepy crawly things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then there's crunchy, crunchy things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "After about two minutes, I go back to my house."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm not a nature boy, but that's great if you're comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The only thing I would say is, don't be like, I can't meditate because there's no trees around."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Other than that, that's great."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Maybe that's why people don't want to."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's because they're recording them."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Then people can listen on the Internet."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "They won't know who you are when you ask a stupid question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Or an intelligent question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You won't get anything either way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I wanted to ask about the tension that I sometimes feel at the beginning of a meditation in my shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm just holding my body still."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I've practiced isometrics in beginning yoga where you tense up each muscle and then relax."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Do you advise that in this kind of meditation? It's not something that I do, but certainly if that's helpful for you to get started, that sounds like it could be helpful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If it works for you, not to spend the whole time doing that, but if that's a good way for you to settle in, that sounds great."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Certainly one of the hardest things is to get into those first few minutes of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In a way, that relaxation or that softening sort of happens naturally just by sitting and breathing and being present."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But if you want to kind of awaken it and encourage it, that's helpful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I just noticed that when I slouch my shoulders, I have a tendency to do that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But if I try putting them back, then it feels like I'm trying to figure out how to get comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "One of the things we can get the idea that the body is getting in the way of our meditation, but really if the body is calling to you, or if that's where there's a strong experience happening, strong sensations, then that can become your meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So that's the thing about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Mindfulness isn't about creating an experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "When we hear the word meditation, it kind of sounds like, oh, I'm going to be really relaxed and peaceful and maybe even blissful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then you sit down and your thoughts spin out and your body is all uncomfortable and you're going, oh, I must be doing this wrong or I've got the wrong."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I should go to that other meditation center down the street."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But it's really, you're just, when we come out of our thoughts, out of our minds for a moment, we discover what the Buddha called dukkha or suffering."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The kind of inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence, which was really what he was trying to solve."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And sometimes it's very subtle."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Sometimes it's very obvious."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it's not that we're always uncomfortable or that we never have a nice good time or that we're never happy."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's not the point at all."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But certainly when we sit down and try to sit still, when we begin that process, we discovered that there's a lot going on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the approach of mindfulness is not to try to push that aside and get to something else, but it's to say, wow, this is what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Can I just be present with this? And can I be present with this without either trying to fix it or running away from it? And it's very much related to me to the impulse to addiction because we find that as soon as there's discomfort, we want to do something about it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We don't want to feel discomfort, which is one of the underlying drives, not even underlying."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "One of the main drives that causes addiction is our unwillingness, ability to just be present with the unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The other one, the other main piece of addiction is the craving to feel good."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So there's aversion to the uncomfortable and then there's the desire for the pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And you'll find that as you sit in meditation that both of those energies will appear both emotionally, both mentally in your thoughts and just as an impulse."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So the place we're kind of aiming for is the place of just being able to be centered and balanced and accepting with whatever comes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is the real skill that we are developing that has to be developed in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The first reaction is naturally like, oh, my body hurts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What am I supposed to do about that? How do I make that go away? I'm thinking too much."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "How do I make my thoughts go away? And those are the kind of natural responses to this experience, but mindfulness, we don't offer a solution to that, exactly."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The solution really is the way out is through."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the power of mindfulness is that when we engage in that way, it's not that it stays like, oh, I'm just sitting here for half an hour just feeling lousier, you know, being anxious or whatever the thing is that's going on for you, that the mindfulness itself has a healing quality."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And if we trust in that, then we find that we move through the experience by allowing it in."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And we allow, it's just our presence that engaged presence that allows the experience to be kind of self-healing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If there's any magic to this practice, that's it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "During this mindful meditation, are you going to be speaking and guiding us the whole time? Would you like me to shut up? Well, I like Blisting Out, actually, which is probably what I shouldn't be doing, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If you're really Blisting Out, then my voice shouldn't be a problem."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "No, it's not, but, you know, it's just not used to it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Different times I'll be guiding different amounts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Tonight, being the first night, I wanted to really stay with people."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I mean, I feel the same way in terms of my own practice."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So let's take about eight minutes of eight."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Let's take an eight-minute break."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We'll ring a bell in seven minutes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was asked if I would talk about my experiences in India and Nepal, but I've never been to Asia, so."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Why would that stop you? Really, you know, I was too busy with other things to be traveling around."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was traveling around, like, upstate New York, playing in Hall day-ins when other people were going to Asia, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it kind of occurred to me that maybe there were some things that people wanted to cover, so, you know, I'll just, well, we'll have time for questions later."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But if at some point, you know, you feel like something isn't getting addressed that you really wanted to get into over these couple of weeks, please let me know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Speak to me, write to me, send me a telegram, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I wanted to begin at the beginning, step one, and see if we can talk a little bit about how we can connect this process with Buddhist teachings and with meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And also, partly, to kind of just talk about the steps."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I, you know, I got sober and alcohol is anonymous, and so my version of the step, or the alcohol is anonymous version of the step is we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives become unmanageable."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I say that because this isn't an AA meeting, and it's not a 12-step, it's not affiliated with any 12-step program."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I hope that there are people from many programs, usually people from all kinds of different programs come."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it seems to be, for one thing, a lot of people from food programs come to my groups."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So the question of the substance isn't really, or the behavior, isn't really the point, and it's not so much what I'll talk about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I'll also say that sometimes I will refer to alcoholics, or usually addicts and alcoholics, or sometimes addicts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I prefer the word addict to cover kind of everything."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so if you are in some program like Alanon, or something that doesn't sort of identify as being an addict, I hope you will kind of translate for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's just a matter of shorthand because if I list every substance and program every time I say that, it just gets tedious."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So one of the ways to look at step one from a Buddhist viewpoint is to think of it as awakening to right view, which is the first step in the eight-fold path, which is the Buddhist sort of path of freedom comparable to the twelve steps."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And with right view we see the Dharma, we see the truth of the way things are, and the fundamental aspect of right view is seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of suffering is the starting point."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this obviously parallels what step one is seeing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We talk about being in denial."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So before we have right view, our eyes are closed or clouded."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Before we admit that we're powerless, we were in this state of not seeing our addiction in some way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I was thinking about that word denial today and feeling like it's not quite how I see that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I think there are times when people, because the word denial implies something intentional, I deny that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Like, hey, you're an alcoholic, I deny it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so there's sort of an intentional rejection."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And certainly that's the case for some people."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I think what's more common is a lack of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And maybe after we become aware, then we deny it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But first there's this lack of awareness, which in Buddhism we call it ignorance or delusion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's one of the three poisons, greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So in delusion, we just don't see the way things are."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And we live in this, living this lie and this confusion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it's not really intentional."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it's very difficult to come out of delusion or ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In the same way, it's very difficult when you're meditating to come out of a thought."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I mean, what allows you to stop spacing out when you're spacing out? It's kind of mysterious."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's one of the things about meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Like, how is it that I just woke up and realized, oh, I was thinking? I don't have an answer to that question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But the only thing we know in Buddhist terms is that everything comes as the result of some cause."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So there is a cause for it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so we could go back and say, well, we've developed some amount of mindfulness and concentration, and that allows that to happen."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the same can kind of be said about how do we wake up to the fact that we're addicts or alcoholics, that people often say, well, it was just through the grace of God that I didn't do it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I can certainly understand that I feel that way myself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But because of that, I really believe in the teachings of Buddhism which say that everything has a cause."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm not willing to accept the idea that some external magical force intervened in my life, because I don't believe in external magical forces."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So that means that I actually got sober because there were causes for it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so I've kind of gone back and realized that one of the ways that recovery is portrayed, at least in the meetings that I've been in, is one of the ways, is sober good, before sober bad."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then I crossed this line, I went from bad to good."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And there was just this sort of magical thing that happened."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But again, in Buddhist terms, that's not an acceptable explanation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There had to have been something good mixed in with that bad."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And indeed, I think for most of us, if we go back and look at the whole of our lives, leading up to the time when we came into recovery, when right view revealed itself, when we admitted we were powerless, there were positive things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We weren't just horrible people doing stupid, horrible things all the time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "For most of us, I would say for all of us, there were competing forces within us, good and bad forces competing with us."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "At a certain point, the kind of good finally overcame that negative stuff enough for us to take that step."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's important for me, too, in terms of my self-esteem, in terms of how I think about myself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Because there is a way in which you can get this very negative feeling about yourself being an addict."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And God forbid you should slip, then you're bad again."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was good for a while, then I went back to being bad."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And how do I get to be good again? I don't know how, because I'm bad."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "As funny as it sounds, there's some truth to it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is one of the reasons why it can be very hard for people to get sober again after slipping."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So this waking up, this right view is a moment of insight."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The word insight in our culture I think is mostly associated with having a good idea, or having a clear idea of something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But in the meditation practice that we talk about as mindfulness nowadays is really insight meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This place is called the Insight Meditation Center, by the way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What that insight really is, is not so much a thought, but a realization."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The first step is a realization."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's not, hmm, I just figured out that I'm an alcoholic."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It isn't quite like that, right? It's like a light goes on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it's a transforming insight, which is the most powerful kind of insight, actually."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There are insights when you see something, you go, wow, I really get that now."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But you can't really necessarily change your behavior right away, or maybe at all."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But it might not be that kind of insight."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But the insight into addiction is a transforming insight, very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And in fact, I would say that it is a spiritual awakening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Which, you know, is interesting because at the last step says that having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, I always used to think that that meant you had to go through all 11 steps before that, and then you would have a spiritual awakening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I don't believe that anymore."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I believe that the first step and every step involves a spiritual awakening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the spiritual awakening of the first step is awakening to your addiction."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the transforming insight is that the awakening is not only seeing it, but it's a letting go."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's what the difference between a transforming insight and a regular insight is."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "A transforming insight, there's a complete uprooting, a complete letting go."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it's interesting that, you know, this step, you know, many of the steps have controversial words in them."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And a lot of my work has been around those words."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the controversial word in step one is the word powerless, I would say."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Many people resist this word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And there seems, there's a lot of confusion around the word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I think there's a lot of misunderstanding of the word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's my opinion, of course."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I'd like to talk about the word powerless."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So first of all, I think it's the wrong word for what they were talking about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I think that one of the things that the people who wrote the 12-step literature were doing were using words that were very powerful and really got your attention."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And shook you up in a way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And also trying to make something succinct so that the steps didn't go on for like 10 or 15 pages."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You know, they're very, we admitted we were powerless over alcohol."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And, you know, in a way, you know, so the way that I think they are literally accurate is when they're talking about someone who, once they take a drink, can't control, can't stop necessarily."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I wasn't a daily drunk."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was a daily drug and alcohol taker."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I didn't get drunk every day."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I wasn't like totally powerless over alcohol where if I had a sip of alcohol, I just went on a run."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I was powerless over alcohol in that sometimes I went on a run."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And sometimes I wouldn't know I was going to."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And sometimes I wouldn't know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the fact that I didn't know and that I couldn't control it to me means that I didn't have that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's how I define my powerlessness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I think what a more accurate word is control is that I couldn't control alcohol."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I couldn't control my use of alcohol."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's, you know, I don't mean to open up like a debate about whether that's right or not, but get more at the point that if we're resisting this idea that we have no power, if we can say, well, can you control it? Well, no, I can't control it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That doesn't mean I don't have any power."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Okay, then you can do this step."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Now this word powerless doesn't really show up in Buddhist teachings, but it's implied in some of the fundamental teachings."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The Buddha recommended that each day we contemplate the inevitability of change in the form of sickness, old age and death and loss."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the fact that these things are inevitable means that we are powerless over them."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And really if we look at a lot of the key teachings in Buddhism, the teaching on suffering, the teaching on impermanence, these are things that we don't have control over, that in fact have control over us."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's something I'll talk about more in step two and step three."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But this larger issue, sometimes people say, oh, well, I'm powerless over everything."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And they kind of go, well, I don't think that's true."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that sort of implies a helplessness or no responsibility."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's very much against both Buddhist and 12-step teachings."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I mean, the 12 steps are very much about being responsible."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I think that's really not quite getting it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But the thing is, the problem that I think we have as addicts is that we want to control the things that we can't control, but we don't want to be responsible for the things that we're responsible for."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So we don't want to control the things that we are and do something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Acceptance, which is obviously a very important quote in the big book about acceptance, the importance of acceptance, is really key to both accepting our disease and accepting sickness, old age and death, accepting impermanence, accepting suffering, all of that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is all under this greater realm of powerlessness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the kind of spiritual approach to that is called surrender, just letting go, surrendering to the inevitable, to what is true."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so when we sit down to meditate, to get more into the specifics of this practice, one thing we can say about that or one way of describing what we're doing is we're sitting down and just being with the way things are and sitting down with an attitude that I'm going to see if I can be with whatever is without trying to change it, without trying to control it and just be present with it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So my responsibility is to try to be present."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What I don't have control over is thoughts that might come through my mind, the emotions that might come through me, the sensations that might appear in my body, all of that or the noises that come from outside."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So we're kind of sitting down with an attitude of practicing powerlessness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is in some ways what we are doing in meditation, practicing powerlessness, just saying I'm going to sit here and not try to fix anything and what happens."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so practicing powerlessness is also practicing acceptance."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But again, finding out what can I do something about when Buddhism we talk about right effort."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it's not that meditation is a passive activity, anything but."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's kind of another one of those mistaken impressions people get."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, you see people sitting so quietly, just sitting still, they're doing nothing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But when you sit down and try to do nothing, of course, a lot happens."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "A lot goes on and you have a role in that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "How to make an effort to stay present."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "How to come back from spacing out."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "How do we do that? Well, what we do is we just over and over every time we notice we're spacing out, we come back over and over."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And we're gradually training ourselves to just stay, just as Jack cornfield's analogy with the puppy."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Just bring him back, stay."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "He runs off, bring him back, stay."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And gradually the puppy learns."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And our minds are about as smart as a puppy, you know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I mean, we're, you know, we're."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You would think with all our intelligence, we would just be able to say to ourselves once, stay."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But now, in fact, puppies actually learn faster now that I think of it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So another aspect of powerlessness that I think is implicit, and I think we kind of all know, but I think it's good to make explicit is what happens before the powerlessness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Before, before we succumb to the power of the alcohol and the drugs and sex or the gambling, the food."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that is the obsession and the compulsion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "These are more difficult to manage in some ways than substances because with a substance you can."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's very obvious you're picking it up, you know, and you can more easily, if you're not obsessed, not pick it up."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Thoughts, as we know, are much harder to control."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So obsession, I would say is not certainly not original, but obsession is the mind getting caught on an idea and not being able to let go of it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then compulsion is the craving or really the need to act out of that obsession, which is the undeniable need to act out of that obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So it seems to me that once you get to the level of compulsion, it's really, really tough to turn back."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's when you're supposed to call your sponsor, you know, and rarely does it happen."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So let's go back to obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Another very tough place to get out of because, as we know, it's very hard to realize that you are thinking when you are caught up in thinking."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And when you are caught up in that kind of thinking, obsession has the quality, obsessive desire, has the quality of focusing the mind."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Actually, it's a very concentrated state."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Unfortunately, it's concentrated on a destructive thing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it has a focus that there's only one thing that I care about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's only one thing I want."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's only one thing I'm going to do."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In fact, it's not even, there's only one thing that I can do."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "That's the feeling with obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is why mindfulness is an antidote."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Because mindfulness has this quality of opening up our experience to see the whole of a situation and to see that there are choices."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And immediately with mindfulness, as soon as we're mindful, we go, oh, I can turn left or right."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I realize that with obsession, it's just I must keep going in this direction."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it's interesting that I read an article about, it was actually about when John Kennedy Jr."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It was an article about panic in the New Yorker some years ago."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it said that in the state of panic, people have, the reason people kind of mess up is that they get focused on one thing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "They can't think of anything else."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So someone who's flying a plane will start to think, I've got to pull this lever."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Not realizing, like, no, there's a light flashing over there that's telling you push me, you know, and sorry."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that, you know, it just strikes me how similar that is to alcoholic or addictive obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So there's some kind of connection in there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm not sure what it is, but panic, you know, panic is a survival mechanism."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I think that our addiction is kind of a misguided kind of survival, an attempt at survival."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's kind of a really confused reaction to some feeling that we're going to die if we don't do this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So as I look at this process of obsession and then compulsion, what my experience is that there are triggers for obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's what the hungry, angry, lonely, tired halt acronym is about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's about things that trigger us for our addiction."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You know, I get tired and then I start kind of thinking about a nice warm martini or, I don't know, never drank martini."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "A warm martini, that sounds horrible."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "A martini sounds horrible anyway to me, but my mother loved him."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Maybe that's why it sounds horrible to me."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But we, you know, our defenses come down when we're tired or we're, you know, lonely and we're trying to fill ourselves up."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We go to the refrigerator and start, you know, grab the half gallon of ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So the halt is supposed to, of course, remind us it's supposed to snap us out of the obsession or is to actually, I think, to help us to avoid the obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "To realize, wow, I'm lonely, I should make a phone call because otherwise I'm going to go in a bad direction."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I've found, in my experience, I think most of you will probably agree that there are many other triggers."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And one of the keys to staying sober and to working with really any kind of destructive behaviors is to avoid the triggers."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is the first aspect of the Buddha's four great efforts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The first great effort is to avoid those things that arouse negative mind states."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so avoiding triggers is a way to not set off the obsession."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is the place where I think we can actually get some work done."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I think, as I say, once the obsession starts very hard to get out of that, once you're into the compulsion, you know, it might be a long time to come back until you wake up."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I'd like to actually do an exercise around triggers."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this will be something we'll do some of the evenings."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so I'm going to teach you a little bit more about mindful speaking because I'm going to ask you to talk to each other."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I'm going to teach you a little bit more about that tonight and then hope that you will remember the basics of it the other nights."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I'll remind you, but I'll give more extensive instruction tonight."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So mindful listening and mindful speaking is the two things that we do."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Mindful listening is a little easier to explain, probably a little easier to do, although it depends on the individual."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "With mindful listening, you are simply making the person who's speaking to you the object of your meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Instead of paying attention to your breath, you're paying attention to them and to what they're saying."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And as you listen to them, you drop anything that interrupts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So any thoughts that appear as you're listening, any judgments or comments, sort of your mind going off rehearsing for your turn, just as soon as you notice it, you just drop it and you just come back to listening, just drop it, come back."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And it's an interesting, that in itself is an interesting process."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If you haven't done this before, I think you'll find it interesting, if not at least valuable."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It can be helpful to keep some attention in the body as you're listening and as you're speaking."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So you can do that in whatever way, you can kind of experiment with that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Some people find it helpful to pay attention to their limbs because they're more neutral emotionally."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Other people rather connect with their emotions and kind of feel the kind of viscera as they're listening, the belly, the chest."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You might feel your breath as you're listening if that's where you're drawn."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But having some, grounding some attention in the body kind of just helps you to stay present."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And you find that there's kind of this spectrum of awareness that you can be quite aware of your body and listen without missing a word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In the same way that you can be thinking and listening without missing a word, but it's not with the same depth of hearing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So to play with that with your listening, with mindful speaking is more challenging really because the words are kind of the currency of ego."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So when you open the mouth, ego tends to come out."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The story, how you want to portray yourself, your memories as you've constructed them, who you want to be, how you want to appear."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So as much as possible to try to go below that, to go into the heart, the deeper truth."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And people who are used to sharing in meetings know about this place, about speaking from the heart."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So you can draw from that kind of depth of honesty and also really trying to stay in your body, so staying present as you're doing it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So you're not going too much into the head."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Some people find it helpful to actually put a hand on their heart as they speak."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It kind of grounds you and you'll notice that you'll actually speak a little bit differently."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "The Buddhist instructions were to say what is true and what's helpful at the right time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is the right time, because I'm telling you it is."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "For whatever depth of sharing you want to share."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Obviously, first of all, I would say please maintain confidentiality."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And really that should be an agreement amongst us anyway in this group."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Because by being here, there's kind of an implicit statement that you're in a program and those are supposed to be anonymous."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So kind of respecting that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But to say what is true is that's a very subtle question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What is true? How do I know that this is true? What I'm saying? Well, I remember it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, how do you know that your memories are true? And our language tends to toward kind of making absolute statements like I always do this or I never do that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So really watching just your use of language so that you're being more precise."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is a good tool to use just in speech anyway."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's a good tool to use for right speech."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So to modulate your language in the ways that so that you can say it seems like I always or I feel as though I usually or it seems like I should, you know, kind of framing things just so that it's true."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, it seems that way to me because then you're expressing just how you feel."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You're not saying this is an absolute truth or an absolute fact."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Finally, about speech to try to pause and wait for the full truth to kind of come up rather than feeling like you've got to speak."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You're not going to be interrupted because your partner is going to be silent when they're when you're speaking."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So you can kind of take your time and let the thoughts come up and really just before you speak."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You always know what you're about to say, even though usually we don't notice that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But if you when you slow down a little bit, you realize, oh, the thought is formed in the mind before it's spoken."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And so in that split second, you can kind of see does this need to be kind of modified."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I don't mean editing it for, you know, to make it PG or something, you know, but editing it for, you know, truth."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I don't expect you to remember everything I'm saying, but I hope you get the spirit of that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And what I'm going to ask you to do in a moment is to pair off."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then I'm going to then I'm going to suggest that you talk about what triggers you have either for your identified addiction or for just kind of the negative places that you go."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "They could be emotional states."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "They could be other behaviors that are not identified as addictions or could be identified as addictions."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But you haven't decided to yet, you know, and to just look at the things that set you off."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And they could be, you know, what sets you off into anger, what sets you off into sadness, into anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But just noticing what are the triggers you have."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And they could be, you know, the whole range."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "They could be many, many different things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It could be your mother, you know, could be the weather, you know, it could be the winter, could be a holiday."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So any questions before we go into the pairing? What? So I'll I'll ring a bell, but I'm just going to give each person about three or four minutes, probably maybe four or five minutes, but somewhere in there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So in the beginning, you'll decide who's going to speak first."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And then I'll ring a bell and then after a few minutes, I'll ring the bell will come to silence and then you just switch roles."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And you don't know that's not necessary."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I mean, I would suggest if we are with your partner that you not do it with them necessarily, you know, you could, but just in terms of kind of making it fresh."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So but it's OK if you know them."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Did you have a question back there? OK, well, I'll just say two things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "One is you don't have to share on any share anything that you're not comfortable with."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And two, if you don't want to do the exercise, that's fine, but you don't have that doesn't mean you have to leave because it's only going to be about 10 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I'd much prefer that you got to stay for the closing and think as we wrap things up."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So so there's a lot of people in this fall space."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So I want you to sit very close to your partner so that you don't have to speak too loud."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "If someone is listening, you can you can there are two levels."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "You can do the normal level, which can involve nodding or nonverbal responses, or you can do the upgrade, which involves the not no response at all, which is just a practice."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's not something we recommend doing outside of here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So so find somebody to work with get close together."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And I'll ring a bell in about five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So if you can wrap that up, that one up."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So let's just come close your eyes for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And just notice all the energy that comes from speaking and from listening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And this is why we have silent retreats."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It's very stimulating to talk and to listen."}
