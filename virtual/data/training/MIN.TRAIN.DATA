{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And it was just something that I do regularly, putting it in there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Somehow something will happen."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And, you know, if I just think about menus and recipes for six months, you know, somehow I'll end up being the cook."}

{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it was interesting because his Holiness said, you know, enlightenment is not easy."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we go to 9 o'clock, right? One of the things that I wanted to do this evening was to do a guided practice on working with emotions, emotional states, and mindfulness for you to have the experience of what it's like outside in the world every day, but to begin to incorporate mindfulness in your daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so what it is is that as you go into meditation, I'm going to guide you into different states, and then I will bring you back to this moment now with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "What are you noticing in this moment? So the more that you practice going away and coming back, especially with an intense experience, then you'll begin to familiarize yourself with that as you go out into the world as well as an opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you bring your awareness to your breath, your awareness should be as gentle and focused as if a butterfly was lighting, landing on your lapel, very, very gentle."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Are they hot or cold? Hard, soft, shaky? Do they move around or stay in one place? Remembering to breathe in and out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And notice if there's a conversation going on in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Are they critical, judgmental, passionate? Remembering to breathe gently and just watch where you are, how uncomfortable they are."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And as you follow your in and out breath and awareness now, ask yourself this question."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But if I can come back to this breath and this moment, I might have the opportunity to make a different choice in the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to get so taken off track that we create train wrecks wherever we go in our emotional or relational lives."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But the more that we can stay fully present and awake and aware, those are the moments we have an opportunity to have a different conversation or a different resolution or maybe unforeseen possibilities that we hadn't even considered, but because we did not go to the place of habitual pattern or habitual reactivity, we're able to entertain something new and different."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So most of these that I have are from the Tibetan tradition."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And if at some point you find you're really taken by the practices and you don't want to spend $20 or $30 for every single book that has been translated on these, you can buy one book that has all of them in it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So Maureen, did you want to, if anybody has questions? Anything about the practice or the guided meditation or? Hi."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, and there was a situation when you did that guided meditation that I thought of."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And there's also this over here to just be aware of it and to be aware of when the irritation arises to begin to neutralize it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But maybe for this light, I'll give myself those five minutes that I haven't had all day to just breathe, just for five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I can always choose to go back and pick it up, or I can choose to be in this moment now."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I'm just sitting in a car."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, like we have them too in our culture, like a stitch in time saves nine."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think one of them is like, oh, never placed the load of an ox on the back of a zoo."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I can always come back to the breath."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The challenge with that is if you're just on your own, is you really have to be pretty mindfully aware to recognize that I'm really in it, and I'm going to choose now to come back to this moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I think it's a good place to practice to start on your cushion, or if you can practice throughout the day, start slowly with people and situations."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so it's like, well, let's go back to this present moment and maybe tomorrow, what will I do differently in the situation? So that would be a good place to start."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's nothing worth clinging to because that clinging creates suffering, creates stress, creates struggle, unease, unhappiness, and actually lack of safety."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the wisdom relates to that growth of understanding around what starts as a kind of an intellectual understanding."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so there is a kind of a stair step kind of fashion in which these factors support each other, wise understanding supports wise intention, which supports the intention to engage in harmony with our fellow human beings, with ethical conduct, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then as we understand that, as there is a direct experience, that kind of confirmation, it can feel startling."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I didn't quite understand what he meant."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the, the, that exploration over time led me to be able to articulate some of the ways that we know wisdom is working."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So a few of the ways we might experience wisdom at work."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then maybe there's a little bit of a shift."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This shift that I'm talking about is kind of like taking the foot off the gas pedal and putting the car into neutral."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "I really feel like it's connected to the seeing into the not-self nature of experience because so often we assume that the reason something is unfolding, the reason why something happens is because I made it happen."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Actually, while I was cutting an apple, I saw a thought arise about an ex-partner being at a fruit stand."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then witnessing that the mind just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that, again, is the experience of wisdom, wisdom seeing the conditioned nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "A few minutes ago, I talked about seeing that and feeling a shift of perspective."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Or it might be that the mind, kind of like I described a minute ago, the mind really connects to, wow, that's arising and it's suffering."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is just this arising."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so wisdom will fall away and will be caught in our delusions and confusions again."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It must have been imagination or something, because that's the way delusion works."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm really happy to be here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And one of the things that intrigues me is I'm just not sure why she chose the title she did."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Wave your hand and say, wait a minute, what were we going to talk about heroism and being changed? So let me start with the poem."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Our story is not a circle carved, but a spiral shed shaped spinning, shifting inward and outward ad infinitum, like a lung on the bank of speech."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "We disembark both beside and beyond who we were, who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This poem invites us to show up in this moment, show up in this moment, in these days, in this month, in this year, to show up with these conditions, just as we are, not as the person we used to be, not as the person we would like to be, not as our ideal selves, but as this person, this person that is weary or excited, this person, these conditions, this room, show up this way and then take a step."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Being aware of what our intentions are, occasionally asking ourselves, what are my intentions here? What is it that I'm doing? Why am I doing this? What is it that's showing up here in this moment? And keeping in mind how it is that we want to be in the moment, not who we want to be, who we want to be."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh, I always thought of being open-hearted as what the generosity that I was going to bestow on others."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But the first thing I have to do is be open."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The practice is to show up with our intentions and what those mean, our intentions of kindness, of wholesomeness, of skillfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so I have a certain amount of ease with that, right? Okay."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And so I'm watching this, and I'm thinking, I should go up and tell that person, this is not acceptable."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I realized that there was outrage and a sense of injustice that was getting really strong."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So maybe the appropriate thing for me was not to think of the best thing to do, but to be aware of this container I have that includes my distress over the war in Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if you've, it's hard to talk about an attitude of mind like this, but has to do with a sense of space."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is, this is the agitation that is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if any of you heard Gil's talk from this morning, but he actually, he's talking about the Satipatana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh, I don't like confusion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And that I am here sometimes puts a little ease in the chaos of what's going on."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "There are no end to things that we might worry about."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we as humans try to protect ourselves against these things."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And we're so busy being vigilant, we haven't noticed that our hearts have turned down, that we have locked ourselves up, that we're constantly looking with an eye of suspicion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Ajahn Chah said, looking for certainty in that which is not certain, you're bound to suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Whatever that experience is like, we can look at that experience and not, oh, this is your fault."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't have to make it mine and have it be, oh, this is an angry person."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "When you're in that space of seeing of discerning the difference between what has arisen and who I am, then we have more freedom to choose the wise next step."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And I remember that look of terror."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And the two girls, they were sisters, would huddle together."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Oh my God, what can I do about this? And to recognize that in the midst of the uncertainty and despair is to realize there's this unpleasant thing."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But to every moment, see it freshly."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "The new conditions change us."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So those are my thoughts for tonight."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Let me read the poem to you again."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Our story is not a circle carved, but a spiral shed, shaped, spinning, shifting inward and outward odd infinitum like a lung on the bank of speech."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How we are moved says everything about what we are to each other and what are we to each other, if not everything."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "May you know the peace of uncertainty, the possibilities of uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And having relaxed the body to some extent, maybe the mind too can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just opening and receiving what's already happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the experience of hearing, some area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just remembering in a light way to stay connected to receiving experience."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Podemos también observar las sensaciones de la atención."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Vean si es posible suavizar un poco."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Este soltar en la musculatura es algo que vamos aprendiendo a hacer."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Poniendo nuestra tensión entre las foces nasales y el labio superior."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ese es nuestro punto de vigilancia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Checkando donde está la mente."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Renewamos nuestra postura, alerta y al mismo tiempo relajada."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Esta postura comunica dignidad, paz y tranquilidad."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Soltando de nuevo el cuello, los hombros."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the shoulders, the arms, the hands can relax a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the middle and lower back and hips can relax, the legs, the feet."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe there's a broader sense of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Can there continue to be some measure of relaxation as you're receiving whatever is obvious? Relaxed and aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Or if a particular mood or emotion comes in, feels like that's pulling at the attention, can there be relaxed and aware of that emotion? Can just being with yourself, with your body, with hearing, with emotions, relaxed and aware."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this is, that is, it's kind of the expression of things arising together."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this arises, that arises, to me, can be more the conditions shaping the future, or in the sense of conditions leading in a direction."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it expresses both how things come to be and how things fall apart."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But it's a clear description that suffering comes to be independence on conditions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But rather, in many places the Buddha kind of describes, or it seems to me that one of the clearest, most succinct definitions of freedom, the freedom from suffering the Buddha pointed to, he said, the absence of greed, the absence of aversion, the absence of delusion, this is Nibbana, this is freedom, this is release, this is cooling, the fire, cooling the fire."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Mental formations, independence on ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so this is the description of this is contact."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Some of the conditioning comes, some of the conditioning around that movement from feeling to craving comes from our own learning, our own kind of what we've experienced in the past and the getting the sense that, oh, if I get a thing I want, I get that little hit of like, it's okay, it feels pretty good."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, we learn ourselves that and we don't have an example of a different way, a different kind of happiness of recognizing that the release from greed and aversion is actually a different kind of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That's that kind of terrain of becoming."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Like clinging is an intensification of craving, birth is an intensification of becoming, a clear sense of I am the one who has this control."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And that it's important to keep that identity going."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So these are kind of, this is the ignorance embedded in greed and aversion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then the more fundamental ignorance aversion says, this is what will make me happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, greed says, this is what will make me happy aversion getting rid of this will make me happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When that's what's motivating the mind, then pleasant feeling is going to lead to craving."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So when the ignorance is motivating the mind, it's like, already those conditions are the stages set for the craving, the clinging, the becoming to happen with that ignorance in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "My own tends to be, if I get rid of things that are unpleasant, then I'll be happy."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's just taken to be, this is the nature of the way the world is."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "But we each, you know, kind of have internalized these collective mental formations, these views, these beliefs from our cultures, from our families."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So we have these these the cycle that not only are we receiving our mental formations from the kind of collective pool of mental formations, but we're contributing those mental formations, we're contributing because our mental formations lead to actions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Not necessarily if there is mindfulness available, not necessarily, but often habitually anger internally conditions, creates conditions for anger to arise in others."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So coming back to this place of the dependent origination where we're looking at the mind and body receiving sense impressions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "That will break the cycle in this being internally or can break that cycle."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And that's true of craving, of clinging, of becoming wherever we are, whatever we are waking up to, wherever we end up waking up in that chain, or whatever is obvious for us in that, the sense of self, the experience of craving and suffering, whatever is obvious there, when mindfulness and wisdom can meet that, ignorance can be kind of released and freedom can happen right there."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I was reflecting that this exploration around mental formations in particular might be a way to contribute to a different composition of that stream of mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it's not hopeless by any means, but it does take the courage, I think it takes a lot of courage to watch these processes unfolding both internally and externally, and not respond habitually, but respond instead from this perspective of mindfulness and wisdom that brings in the relational brahma-vaharas, brings in love and compassion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And the Buddha said it is possible, it is possible to free the mind from greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And it may be that that's not an issue in your life or not interesting, and that's fine."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's, but what maybe just I'll give you now an example of something that happened for someone I know in practice, which is that they began just following the meditation instructions, you know, follow the breath, when the mind wanders away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Sometimes we work directly with things but sometimes we don't have to work directly on things for them to fall away the path works a little bit in sometimes in unseen ways and sometimes in surprising ways."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Who knows and we might in some ways reinforce difficulties by working on them directly."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So there's a little bit of subtlety there in knowing that our mind has certain tendencies but not making them into a self not identifying them with how we are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And I have to work on the bad part and make it go away."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Now there is, of course, a structure to the path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And all of those factors will be developed as we proceed along the path, as we transform the mind in the way that it can through practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "If we have an idea, let's see, I'm supposed to look for which part of effort I'm working on right now."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "In a way, while we're doing that, we're not fully taking in the experience of the moment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So in a way, the Eightfold Path is a process that undoes even identification with the path."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So the beginning of the verse from Sikula, remember it goes like this, if there is something in these teachings calling out to you, it's because there's something in you calling out to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So when the near shore is in focus, when we're really focused on all of those things that keep us busy, we're not focused on the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that can help, in a way, take us deeper into ourselves, deeper into this moment, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "This is something that we can point to maybe during meditation with the breath, the way the breath flows through the whole body, beats with the heart, and unifies everything that's in the body and the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "Usually there is some fruit when it really feels like something is ripe and it's the time to do a short retreat or take a class on something."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And we know there's something coming something there but what it actually is, is not anything that we could have thought about."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's this balance that we're finding."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, let me read this verse one more time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I see a question about the book that I read from."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So can the pull to past or future be softened a little bit? Set aside perhaps for the time being and seeing if there can be an inclination to be here present with the mind and body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Not needing to direct the attention or choose what mindfulness pays attention to."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Perhaps the breath or body sensations or hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "If you're landing with the breath, receive the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Others also become illuminated."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And if that is an odd thing for you to reflect on, your mind gets caught up in what that means, just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "We'll offer an analogy that Gil uses sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Almost as if the experience of our body and mind is a river just flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You're just in that river flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And for some of you, it can help at times if you're comfortable with this receptive form, you're welcome to continue with that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "And the mind will get caught up in thought."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it leads me to think that there are kind of maybe two main flavors of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Somewhere in the story of anxiety is a feeling of hopelessness, of hopeless incompetency."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That overwhelming feeling is not so much the largeness of what's happening, is that just too many things happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's just a total stopping."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You know, that's how we got away from the saber-toothed tigers, right? We set up vigilance."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes it's just a lack of the familiar, you know? I get pretty used to the way I feel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Are we seeing things? How are we seeing things? And intention."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It was interesting to me when I asked people how did they know they were anxious? This seemed to be a really difficult question."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the fourth one is reflecting on what else is here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So those are the four ways that I'd like to look at this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And it's normally about an hour and a half drive to here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I said something about loosening my fingers, loosening my grip from the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And someone was concerned that I'd stopped driving using the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And that's when I noticed that I was actually pulling back on the steering wheel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So here I am going 20 miles an hour on 280 in pouring rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Well, if I'd taken another route, or maybe I should have, or maybe I could scoot over to that lane."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So staying with just the conditions as they are, I softened into that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "At 30 minutes, I know the 30 minutes are up."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But what I found is if I look at what is happening in my knee and study what the feel is in the knee and how it's moving and where it's going and the need to change it changes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I realized, and then there was a slight current."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I am suggesting that learning what the experience is can be very useful."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We're not encouraging or discouraging it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That that amount of easing was really interesting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In the example of a blooming argument or unskillful conversation, I've learned that I can just stop."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And usually the conversation, which tends to be one-sided at that point, keeps going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the urge to retort or complain still leaves, is still there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm still regretful that I didn't see that sooner."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "We have a lot of expectations for what we should be doing with our present moment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And what I've discovered is it's sometimes difficult, but my usual cues are wrong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It makes me feel like I've had a lot of caffeine."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This has a lot to do with staying with what's uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The final thing he did before his enlightenment is he called on the earth, he touched down and he said, I am here, Mara, which is the version of the tempter."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Don't go out there, stay here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What else is happening? And really paying attention to what else is going on."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Fortunately, I try not to keep ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You've probably heard this poem before, but it seems particularly fitting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow and told her in words and in touch, blessings of earth on the sow."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's a parallel to the practice of meditation for me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I can touch down to the individual experience, studying it a bit more, and there's the component of when it all comes together, it has a pointingly feeling to it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's really helpful here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "A lot of experiences bring with them huge amounts of suffering in the body and as somebody pointed out there's practice necessary to live with that."}

{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The suffering in it can easily overwhelm the mind without a lot of training and a lot of care."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And the person references a kind of practice that I often teach with practicing with awareness in daily life and mentioned some struggles there."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Often, it just feels like you're carrying around this heavy weight, and it just doesn't feel like it happens."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So I've, in my own practice, one of the key explorations I've made around daily life practice is to be curious about when awareness does arise in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Because generally we're more interested in what awareness is aware of than we are in being aware, in recognizing that we have become aware."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that moment, you know, that the awareness has returned with something."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So just, just be curious about that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Just the noticing of, oh, I'm mindful here."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Like, you know, we're engaged with something, a conversation with somebody, or we're doing something kind of focused on our computer."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And then for a split second, we recognize, oh, I'm aware now."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So the intention is just to remember several times a day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Remember several times a day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Just remind yourself, well, it doesn't seem like I've been seeing too many of those, but just keep trying."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "That intention will support you to remember occasionally."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it sounds like that approach for the person who asked the question is allowing there to be more ease with recognizing mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "But check in here as the person's doing in this question."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So for me, especially in daily life, I don't put too much pressure on myself to try to be continuously mindful."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "Now it might be that we could prioritize awareness in our daily lives too."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And the person in the question found that noticing mindfulness arising with suffering was easy."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then this remarkable difference in evaluation, where in one we are told the Buddha approves, and we get the impression that the apprentice knows it better than the teacher, which is a little bit surprising because if they're introduced as the teacher and the apprentice, we would kind of expect the teacher knows the stuff better than the student."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And then how do we interpret that around how we understand the self and what's important around the self and what the self is in relationship to needs and motivations and purposes and our place in this world in that deep place? Or what's that connection from that deep place of freedom as we come back to the powers of ten, back into the world, back into society? And not a few people have found themselves transformed so that their relationship and their understanding of what it means to be in relationship to other people has radically changed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And to really delve deep into this kind of very powers of ten to go within, going within, within, letting go of the social world for a while can be transformative so that when we come back into the social world that the sense of neediness is not there anymore, the sense of comparing ourselves and measuring ourselves with other people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And then the social world can have a very different meaning than it had before."}

{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And the question was, for me, is it safe to go up in the hills? There's certainly with all the lightning and there's some danger involved in going up in the hills, hiking."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And part of the help for this is to be able to see the difference between fear and the danger, two different things."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "An interesting place around the distinction is, to quote from the Buddha, he said, there's the person who, having the nature to die, is scared, scared, having care of death."}

{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "That when I have that fear of causing harm, I'm not going to debate it and question whether I should have it or not."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And we learn that because we see over and over again the damage that comes, the pain that comes, the suffering that comes from certain movements of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And that every time we have hostility towards ourselves or towards others, it's painful, it's dangerous to do that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And to see the movements of our own mind as being dangerous, not to condemn them, not to condemn ourselves, but to say, no thank you, I don't need to do that."}

{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And they are distractions from the business at hand, the business at hand being seeing our suffering and seeing how we can let go of it, how we can reduce the amount of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It is also that sense of dissatisfaction, that sense that things are not just right."}

{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's the path that we, the path of practice, really, the path that we walk that can lead us to the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Of course, there are times that we can learn from it and learn to do something more skillful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That was enormously painful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There may be times that that can be quite useful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But we all know how many times people have done something like that only to retire and have a heart attack or have, you know, something else terrible happen."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So is it worth it? Is it really worth it? And each of us, you know, can probably look at some situation in our life where we're doing something that we think is going to have a payoff in the long run."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But if we look really carefully, is it worth it? Is it worth it? So another piece to be aware of is our relationship to suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We all have tendencies that we might not like, but to be free of them might be kind of scary."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "It might be a feeling, might be a memory, might be a story."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And what's left? What's the feeling? What's the experience? What's left as you totally let go of the suffering? And you can open your eyes."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Related to what you were saying, Gil reminds us in the book that suffering is only in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So recognizing our own suffering is a way to get to the compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And compassion for ourselves and compassion for others."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "That when we are facing the suffering, it can be very challenging, very, very difficult."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I thought there's so many areas where I can see I'm suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Because as Linda said, as long as we're not acknowledging that, that doesn't mean it's gone."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "There's no way because I have to face it every day."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Ain't it awful? Kind of things or make ourselves wrong for it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that's the acceptance."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We can change our relationship to it so that we don't suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "I love what you said about, it's the relationship to the suffering or, you know, our attitude."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It might sound like that's cold or clinical, but the experience of that is very intimate, connected."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It separates us from our direct meeting of experience."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Okay, what we talked about in our group was ways and means that we had been using resources to help us through difficult times and obviously the stuff online at IMC has been a real benefit for a lot of people."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "I'll offer just a very few words to support settling in, starting by taking in how you are in this moment, just opening to how the body is, without judgment, without resistance, without holding on to anything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "And having checked in, you may notice, you may know or recognize that their particular aspects or areas of tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Sometimes that's a place where there's physical tension that's held."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Sometimes it can be helpful, as Gil suggests, maybe the brain can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Often body sensation is obvious."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "What is the actual experience that's happening in the physical experience? In talking about what I've just said, the contact points, the contact, the place where the hands and feet touch, the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe movement if you're attending to the breath, expansion, contraction."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Can you know the sensations that are happening right now? You're welcome to just be attending to whatever is obvious for you in the physical body right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "You don't have to go digging for knowing what the sensations are."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "There's a difference between the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral quality and the response to it, just seeing if that can be recognized."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Let's take a moment to notice what the body is like, without judgements, without buyers or preference, so how is it? How is the mind? What's our mood like right now? Do we feel sleepy, alert, we feel cheerful, scattered, depressed, excited? How is it? There's no right or wrong mood, just as with the body, there's no wrong place to start."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Does this have an impact on the mind's feeling of ease or calm, how is it, what is the effect of that relaxation, and letting the attention flow down through the body, moving gently down our neck into our shoulders, notice the sensations that are there as we bring attention to that area, the shoulders soften, relax, drop down a notch or two, often we go through life with our back tense and hunched shoulders up around our ears, we are in a safe place, surrounded by good people, there is nothing we have to be worried about, nothing we have to generate tension, stress about, your shoulders relax, your arms hang easily loosely by your sides, and letting his wave of relaxation then gently continue to flow down, your left arm and your right arm, relaxing them too, whether you have your hands in your lap or in your knees or wherever you choose to have them is not important the exact way we hold them, let the arms and hands be free of any kind of tension and tightness."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Dās pöintīn tú yesterday, it helps us enormously to shift the perspective from me working with my problems, me dealing with my busy mind, to seeing it in terms of the Buddha knowing the dhamma, the wisdom mind knowing the way things are."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "There's a spaciousness, a coolness, a diminishing of stress within the system."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "In LA, it was like, I came here because I wanted to get this out of this day today, and I want to know how I'm going to get that from you."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "What's up with that? Are there any other questions? What posture do you use in the trees? Do you have a tree house? Amongst trees."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Do you advise that in this kind of meditation? It's not something that I do, but certainly if that's helpful for you to get started, that sounds like it could be helpful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "One of the things we can get the idea that the body is getting in the way of our meditation, but really if the body is calling to you, or if that's where there's a strong experience happening, strong sensations, then that can become your meditation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And the approach of mindfulness is not to try to push that aside and get to something else, but it's to say, wow, this is what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We'll ring a bell in seven minutes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "We talk about being in denial."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So before we have right view, our eyes are closed or clouded."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But because of that, I really believe in the teachings of Buddhism which say that everything has a cause."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And how do I get to be good again? I don't know how, because I'm bad."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "It isn't quite like that, right? It's like a light goes on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's what the difference between a transforming insight and a regular insight is."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And a lot of my work has been around those words."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, you see people sitting so quietly, just sitting still, they're doing nothing."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So another aspect of powerlessness that I think is implicit, and I think we kind of all know, but I think it's good to make explicit is what happens before the powerlessness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Thoughts, as we know, are much harder to control."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "There's only one thing I want."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So as much as possible to try to go below that, to go into the heart, the deeper truth."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So you can draw from that kind of depth of honesty and also really trying to stay in your body, so staying present as you're doing it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This is a good tool to use just in speech anyway."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Well, it seems that way to me because then you're expressing just how you feel."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But using the buzzwords, like you said, like I feel like, or I think sometimes I'm this way, really opens up your heart to really speak truly."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Do you have a comment about that? Well, I think it's just cultural."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "I don't know how important it is."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Because you said that we sort of know what we were before we actually go to speak."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "Anyway, that's what I noticed."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "This kind of exercise does, I think, and meditation does this too."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And we have to accept it too."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So what are the things that led you up to right now in your beliefs? What are your beliefs now and how did you get here? So that can involve looking back over your life."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "We've been exploring Feeling Tone in Pali Vedana, V-E-D-A-N-A, which is simply noticing that every object that arises in the six sense doors, the five sense doors, and the door of the mind in Buddhism, that with each object that we notice that consciousness comes in contact with, there's also a Feeling Tone, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "These qualities, these tones are not inherent in the object."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "They're not inherent in the object themselves as a quality of the object, but it's the quality that the mind associates with the object."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Even opening your mouth, as wide as comfortable in making an exhale."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Inviting the center of gravity of your awareness to move down from your head where we associate."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "As if you were perceiving, you're receiving the breath and all sensations from your lower abdomen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Be aware of yourself and the world."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Feeling embodied, noticing the breath within the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Let there be awareness, awareness of their feeling tone, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "Letting there be appreciation in your heart for yourself or having showed up or having practiced."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Who Feels Feelings?", "completion": "And letting go of the outcome, non-attachment to outcome, you try, you did your best, whatever the conditions of your mind were in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Perhaps because you've been practicing at home in your own environments, maybe there'll be a little bit of infusing your home with memories of mindfulness, memories of retreat practice in your home, and those memories may support."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "I talked to somebody who sat the last retreat I taught in this form as a couple of weeks after the retreat, I think, and I asked him how the transition was, and he said that there was more strength of mindfulness that continued following the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And yet, and yet it won't be as strong as it is given the form, given the context, given the support that you have here, the community gathering together a couple times a day, reflection on dharma in the larger group and in the smaller groups, those things, those things really support the continuity in the momentum of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Things may be changed for quite a long time."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "I've named some of them, different contexts of our hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And largely on this retreat, we've been encouraging or exploring the possibility of the suitability of mindfulness in all circumstances."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "I think I did a six week self-retreat at home."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "But I'm fairly sure that there will be a shift, that there will be some different suitable means for you, or an exploration, at least, of what is this different context and what might be suitable in terms of practice, bringing mindfulness into daily life."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "It might be the very circumstances of sitting meditation, but it might be the very circumstances of being in the grocery store, or the very circumstances of taking a walk through the neighborhood, or the very circumstances of preparing your meal."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "But what I had heard from this book was just notice when this thing happens and don't act on it, just be with it."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And maybe it'll last for a certain length of time."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Maybe you're just receiving as you're having breakfast, that you're sitting in the room with your family and eating, or maybe you're receiving the sense of the day as you see it looking out the window."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Like, okay, yes, I know that space of looking for my things and not finding them."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And so there's maybe being honest with ourselves about that."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "So there's a way that we can, whatever we're doing, you know, the normal activities of our lives, it can be interesting to explore how to frame them as they relate to the, as they might be connected to the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "At a certain point, I got curious about like framing that whole activity of being a technical writer as supporting the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "There we are, all in our individual cars, all stuck together in these traffic jams."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "I thought of it as transactional as opposed to an offering."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "It opens the heart, it brings joy and happiness and delight and nourishes those qualities as we engage with the conscious recognition, the conscious awareness of them."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "That's how you might reflect on some of the things that you do often, your daily activities, the things that might not necessarily be directly connected to your highest aspiration or you feel like it's maybe off to the side, something that you have to do in order to do something else that you more want to do."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And for those things that you have to do, there is some way that you can find that connection and be inspired by the Dharma right within that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So, I would like to discuss a very important topic for Buddhist practice, and that is that of letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "I'm clinging to my partner."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But the clinging to the partner is where the suffering can come."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Like, are you supposed to let go and I have nothing then? There's no imagination, there's no sense of what follows letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So if you let go of anxiety, then you can let go into the resulting peace, the ease that's there."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "If you just let go of your thinking in meditation, then you're kind of left with nothing, blank kind of."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "All kinds of things can live within us that are there."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "What we've been practicing over and over and over again, and practice makes perfect, is clinging, holding on."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Or you let go of the push to rush, and you let go and you wait for it to stop, and that's letting go to stop."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And I could feel the impulse, I got to find out what it is, got to check."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Letting go into being aware of the situation."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "No one has to know that you're being friendly."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But it's probably a lot better for you and for your heart to do that than to check the news on your phone or whatever you do."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "To understand yourself better."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So you're not necessarily asked to dutifully let go just because you're supposed to let go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So it may give you another little example, coming to IMC."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And so it occurs to you, well, yeah, that means that a lot of people are going to park further, have to go a little bit further."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Where in the body is there a somatic experience of clinging? Is it in your muscles? Is it in your brain, in the mind, in the heart, in the belly? Where is it when you're really holding onto something and you can't let go? Chances are you'll feel some physical corollary, some place where it's actually being held."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Your attention goes into the hand that's clenched."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "It's kind of like holding the fist."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And that's a healthy movement of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "If you're angry, don't throw daggers, verbal daggers."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Gil, you've talked about letting go off and letting go into, but there's also wise letting go and unwise letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And I have a really hard time letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "We have to also, and then sometimes with a lot of loss and the pain of that, new unhealthy beliefs come into play."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "There might be that we have ideas that we shouldn't be grieving anymore."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And it plays itself out with the topic of depression."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But there might be an ache from that loss that maybe will always be there and not to make it a problem."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "I was able to let go of anger."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Because being neutral is not really letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And that's a beautiful feeling, that's really cool."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "I don't have to want it to relax."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "If I try to give him a hug, if it's not like Christmas Eve or New Year's or whatever, it's really interesting."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Sometimes that's just accompanying."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And, you know, let someone feel like you're there with them."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Even if you don't have to tell them you recognize that you're there with them and that part of them."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "107 for those of you that are going to actually go home and look."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "And this is the eight-fold path."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The fourth is right action, Samakamanta."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It describes a collectiveness in contrast to wrong mīcā, which does not imply evil, but it describes the things that make one stray from the path, the things that do not lead to enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "You understand it, right? I love that definition."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Usually, has students scratch their head and think, oh, I hope it explains a little bit more as we read on in the suit tests."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Our attitude, our view, our understanding, our perspective, these mold our intentions and then our intentions affect our actions."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "What friends is right intention, the Buddha asks."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The intention is not always obvious in our actions."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "What is our intention? Because we don't necessarily see it displayed in somebody's actions."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "So these are very linked to the intention and the speech."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The intention, attitude, or the emotional underpinnings influence what we say, how we speak, and how that speech is received and understood, what the results are, and what the action is that comes out of it."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "So right action is the next one."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "And what friends is right action? Abstaining from killing living beings, abstaining from killing, from taking what is not given, and abstaining from misconduct in sensual pleasures."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "But to be considered the fulfillment of right action, it must be again infused with right view, right effort, right mindfulness, right intention, etc."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "I often speak about right effort."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's important to understand that mindfulness is not always right mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It might present it as a therapeutic tool or a method for improving our performance at work or improving our memory or improving our test scores or improving ourselves in our performance in athletic competitions or music concerts or many, many, many aspects or applications we find mindfulness taught in these days."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It will probably increase our memory."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It will probably reduce certain health problems, stress related health problems."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Put it in a grant application and you'll get a grant."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "With Right Concentration Samasamadhi, the Buddha defined, unification of mind equipped with these seven factors, which are the other seven factors of the path, is called Noble Right Concentration with its supports and its requisites."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not just a matter of abiding by them as a set of rules or a set of guidelines."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "And maybe there's, many of us begin a meditation practice with enthusiasm and resolve and we have this idea we're going to meditate every day or we're going to have compassion for all beings or maybe we'll never tell a untruth or lie again or something like this."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So it's natural, as I said, that when we give instructions or we give some guidance to the mind that there's a little bit of rebellion in the beginning or sometimes later on in practice, too, that shows up in little different ways."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "It's to be expected, it happens to everybody."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "But I don't know anybody who would characterize their practices that way."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "And then once we kind of recognize the common humanity of it then it might be worthwhile to reflect on what is important in your life."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So is there a way that might support you to be in contact with the benefits of your practice so that it can support you when you don't feel like getting to the cushion? When it feels you feel like you're too busy or there's just, in some ways, there's a lot of resistance, a certain amount of struggle to get to the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So that can help support some of the resistance to getting to the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So one expectation that we might have is that we have this idea that there shouldn't be any thinking during meditation."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Most often what happens is maybe instead of our thoughts be the equivalent of writing a novel, maybe it just gets down to where we're writing only a chapter, and then maybe only writing a paragraph, or then maybe only writing a sentence, and then maybe a word, and then nothing."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Just like our thoughts are coming and going, all of our experiences are coming and going."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So in some way that was introduced we might imagine to emphasize that things take time."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "In fact it's often the opposite, most often the opposite."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "Just bringing your attention to that heart center and allowing your breath to gently nourish and focus on the goodness, the sweetness in your life."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "Yeah, I left Berkeley about six o'clock in hopes that I was not going to get caught in that horrendous rainstorm, but I did."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "Keeping in mind that help is available, particularly the help that comes from the Buddha, the doctor, as he encourages us to use the medicine of mindfulness in the presence of the sangha, the nurse."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "So any comments or questions about that that I could answer before we begin? And I hope that clarifies things a bit for you, just on a general level."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "The question was persistent feelings of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "None of these mind states, by the way, I also wanted to mention, you know, there seems to be like a spiritual morality system where if you need to see a psychiatrist or you need to get your feelings of depression evaluated, somehow it's a moral failure by doing so."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "So would you say that a skillful desire, if you prolong it, if you endure it, then you attain good results, good outcomes? If you stick with it, again, if the desire is skillful and you approach it in the right way, then you realize, okay, if I do this, this will lead me to my goal, so you focus on doing this to get you to the goal."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "But it also means, okay, look back, what am I doing wrong? And sometimes it will require a lot of effort and a lot of sacrifice to hold to the skillful desire, to hold to the skillful path, but that suffering is worth it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Because ultimately you know that the path is the most greatest thing that you could ever do."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "He starred himself all those years to find a way to find the path."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "That gives you energy to keep going."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "So what that really means is that when you're looking at things from a standpoint of what you're trying to achieve versus what you're trying to do immediate, the skilled desire itself is an aid directly to what you're trying to do immediate versus even though it also helps you towards a certain direction where you ultimately like to achieve."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "That can be part of the path."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And say, well, nobody ever slept their way to awakening."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And I was sitting there, I was in pain, and the mosquitoes were biting, and it was just kind of miserable."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And I said, for the good name of America, I've got to sit."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "He looked over at this American, and he was very calm."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Sensuality craving, becoming craving, and non-becoming craving."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And then I can think about them."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Years back there was a book on the Buddhist approach to desire in which the author was basically saying, desire is not a bad thing as long as you're not attached to the objects of your desire."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "That's you in that particular becoming."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "We're all on a human level of becoming."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "We share this world together."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And then to experience that for a while and then we fall from that, or rise from the lower ones."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Higher than the sensual becomeings are the sensual, the becomeings of form."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "These are the Brahma levels, the kind of lower Brahma levels."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Other people move to the form or formless levels."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Wouldn't that be cool to be nothing? Just to be done with everything."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "One, he says, you look at things when you move from mundane right view to transcendent right view."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "The other was, as I mentioned earlier, we're getting this raw material in from our past actions that we then create."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "If there is a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, you're bored by it, you want something new."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "For example, one of the reasons why relationships don't work is you think you desire another person, but actually you desire your perception of that other person or your plans for that other person."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Do they actually sell BMWs in advertisement? They sell your concept of you as the owner of the BMW."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And so it's good to notice, okay, where exactly is your desire for this BMW located? It's not in the BMW itself."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "So we've got three types of craving, for sensuality, becoming, for non-becoming."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Your duty with regard to the cause of suffering is to abandon it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And this is the understanding of craving that will get you to the noble goal."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "The second is that you're looking for the causes of your suffering, not outside, you're not blaming other people."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "The ones that work are where you're actually clear about why you like the other person."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "What it means to be overcome by two viewpoints and what is meant by adherence in that case."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "And so the other question was just about the overcoming and adherence and what those words mean."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "In other words, you see the whole world in terms of these viewpoints, and the first case is that adherence here is when you're delight in becoming, you just want to have a better and better and better becoming that those are the only terms you can think of."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Okay, well, I mean the Buddha actually says, actually it's the Nanda who says, one form of craving as you see that other people have gained awakening and say, they can do it, they're human beings."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "You can take on Tesla, you can take on capitalism."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "I guess that's too much information, but I'm just like, this is not helpful, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 1", "completion": "Secondly, you've got to have a lot of goodwill, especially for certain people in their positions of high power, because otherwise you're not going to be able to deal effectively with them."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And the strengthening of these, developing of these, sets the stage for the maturation of insight, the maturation of practice for deeper insight for awakening himself."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Then sometimes they don't really can develop as effectively or efficiently as if with a recognized and appreciated."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "It has to do with concentration itself, engaged states of concentration."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Would that be nice? And then we'll see how that goes."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And to be able to have these developed strongly in the heart or in the mind or within us so they kind of stand out in relief or in highlight is one of the great things to experience."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Mindfulness and tranquility and joy and concentration equanimity is a really beautiful thing."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And not only in our behavior but also in our inner activity of how the mind functions."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "So in Buddhism, we're trying to change this inner landscape so that it becomes a satisfying place to be."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And if he can pee, then he goes, gets through the night just fine."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "So I, you know, I've, and the first times I did this, boy, was it a fight."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Or, you know, after we finish in the toilet, he's still sleepwalking basically."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And then I gently kind of redirect him and turn him around and kind of bring him in."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And gently begin turning the mind, the heart, to be engaged and be present for what's actually happening here and now."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "I hope that it has some lasting positive impression on him."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "And we're not relying on some kind of particular insight as being the solution to it all."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "But really, to really do it in a mature way that really allows for some lasting transformation, you really want to start with the basics and begin taking responsibility for what goes on inside your heart."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "We learn about the challenges we're up against."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Also, in that regard, sometimes Buddhist practice doesn't really begin until you fail at it."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Enlightenment: Concentration (part 1)", "completion": "Buddhist practice works when it doesn't work."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "That's why some of the tools, the reminders to check in, I think are very helpful, knowing that we're not continuously mindful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "If we're confused, you know, we kind of have a vague idea of what it means, but not exactly."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Some of it is the desire of tanhav, thirst of greed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "In that moment, the mind is not averse."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "But sometimes I see the presence of a hindrance, like a cloud, in the Maya cloud of aversion, or cloud of desire, which is representative of that hindrance arising over many mind moments."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And after a while that can become very familiar."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "My question is more about the way Buddhism is taught here in the West."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "There is a taboo, explicit or implicit, against discussing attainments, against setting explicit goals for practice, which seem to be motivated by not wanting us to be striving too much or clinging or avoiding the hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "To expect to the first one, there are both pragmatic reasons that I feel it's not that helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So I have kind of two different views with respect to the two questions."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "On mindfulness, you talked about wisdom and the use of whether it's skillful or unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And expectation has the wanting mind in it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "That was a particularly meaningful and intense, you know, aversive reaction."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "In some cases the behavior seems relatively trivial or petty."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "I don't know what you mean."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "There's a problematic situation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So it's very helpful pragmatically in terms of resolving difficult situations to free ourselves from our own reactivity first."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Which I learned that lesson."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And then one day, we were together, and for the very first time, I actually saw the person."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And then he says, regardless of how people are speaking with us, we should abide with loving kindness, compassionate for their welfare."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "But if we have it in our minds, okay, can we just practice trying to remember that at times? And that ties into something in the Satya Bhattana Sutta, which again we often overlook, the reminder to practice mindfulness internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Somebody asked him, what is it that's reborn? He said, you're neurosis."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "You know, and so there are very different guidelines for monastics and for lay people."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "When is it too much? When are we getting addicted? Can we have periods of time where we do renounce certain things to experience just the greater ease? So I just think it's a huge arena of investigation for us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "In seeing the flow of impermanence, the Buddha talked about how the mind becomes disenchanted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Being disenchanted, it becomes dispassionate."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "It's a harder-minded peace."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And a lot comes out of the peace."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "We may be in bigger motion and then it triggers all kinds of thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And then the thrust of your talk about how mindfulness leads to wisdom, leads to release, leads to non-clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "That progressive sequence, defined progressively like people like Anaglio in his most recent book, in Tanjaff, increasingly the mind is less disturbed by inward and outward, seeing things increasingly inwardly, the corner phrase."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "They were moving too quickly or moving too slowly."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Seeing, I was just mindful of that sense door."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "The mindfulness of bringing it back to where it arose and being mindful completely eliminated the opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Not liking it, not liking it, commenting it, judging it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And first, I apologize for using another I acronym."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And what you created, both through IMS and this whole scene, I feel I benefited from."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And so IRC here is, you know, I think of it a little bit as flowering of seeds that you planted."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So the good number of people here, not only come to IRC to practice here, but also volunteer here helping to run the place, run the retreats and everything."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And in the beginning years, there was chaos."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So you'll be back to do everything."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And Ori, do you want to say a couple words about yourself? Sure."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "We're super excited you're here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Body sensations related to breathing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "There's nothing specific that is supposed to be happening and there's nothing that needs to be happening."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "But I've spent a lot of time kind of thinking about what do I want to say to you? How can I inspire you? What's important for you to know about engaging on this path? And I think probably the first thing I should say is just thank you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "The rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And the path to me is about, there's this connection with walking a path, hiking a mountain, finding our way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And actually it's a path that is both inner and outer."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "There's a sutra called the Nagara Sutra, the city."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And Gil once told me that you are a member of IMC if you wish to be."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So the path is also called the path of peace, right? Because one of the main tenets of the Buddhist teachings is not to cause harm."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So here's a little quote by Rene Damal."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "He says, keep your eyes fixed on the way to the top, but don't forget to look at your feet."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "We come back and we find it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "The Buddha started his life according to the stories as a very wealthy, potentially prince, someone who lived a charmed life and was catered to in every way and protected from anything difficult in life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "He saw sickness, aging, death."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So it's a gradual path that takes time."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "It's about orienting, right? So this is right view and right intention."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And then the third part of the path is about samadhi or concentration."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And as our practice grows, they all come together."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So I hope you'll give yourself the opportunity in space to make choices for yourself along the way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So now I'm going to turn it over to Lori to set us up for doing some breakout groups."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Moe, before I do that, is there anything about breakout rooms specifically that either Tanya or Chris wants to add? Yeah, I just want to say that if you don't want to join your breakout group, you can just decline the invitation to the breakout room."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And you'll end up in the main room and then we'll know and we can reassign people."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So we're going to do a very brief reflection to help us kind of get into a mode where we have something to share."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "What's inspiring you to take up the eight-fold path or to learn more about it at this time and simply allow whatever comes up in response to come up? Perhaps there was an obvious answer."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I just wanted to share that I've been participating in IMC's Happy Hour."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Just retreats are not enough."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And then why are you really here? What got me touched the reason I'm here is because I want to change my ways, learn different ways to cause less harm, become a better person."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I found a lot of comfort from the breakout rooms in the commonality that a lot of folks are here because of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Looks like there is another hand there, Randy Stafford."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And then we'll have these breakout groups that you some of you have expressed that you found them useful."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So I will resend that to everybody later today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "You know, it's just it's an easier read, I would say."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "But we've discovered it's useful if we parse them out and mail them to you once a week so that you get an email reminder that you're even doing this once a week with the reflections for that week in the email."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I just want to say a little bit about, you know, you don't, don't take this like this course is for you, right."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "It's not like you have to check check check do every single one of them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "You know, I've done this practice for 25 years and this path for nine years running and I'm still working on it I'm still learning things from it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "But if you have a sitting practice of some sort, it's invaluable to keep that going as a baseline of support for this practice."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And one other thing to say is that a large number of the mentors will be on a two week retreat for the second half of September that Gill is offering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Okay, and if you can't come please respect the mentors time and try to let them know you know try to be in touch because we all we want to meet with you and if you just don't show up then we're wondering what what happened so, you know, try to try to."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Well, I've been reading the chats and there was a question about what do the mentors do."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Maybe we might be able to point you toward other resources or teachers that maybe share path information in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Laura, I see a hand there."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And there might be questions like noticing, I don't know, things about your speech habits, when do you speak in ways that you regret, you know, things like that, just really, really practical things about how these, how these factors are playing in your life."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Let me just say one more thing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So it's more of a circling on short contributions."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Or the other possibility was to doodle."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So that would be good to check out."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So our group had some great ideas, a lot of similar ideas."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So I think that's pretty much what we covered."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "It looks like so I'll just open it up and see if there's other, you know, questions people have about any part of what we've covered here today."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "He has two little short things on the introductory, introduction to the path and introduction to the program."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And you could also read the introductory chapters to either of those books."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So that was one of the questions that came out of our breakout group."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "But we won't get them all at once at the beginning of the month."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I'm not usually open to new people, but I have found I've been missing out on some good stuff."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So just know that Chris is going to look into exactly how to do it this time but it may not happen right away."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "We will figure out some way to have it be self organizing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Haven't got it figured out."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And first of all, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And even though I resist Zoom and get sick of it, like everybody else, I always have a, I, this is amazing."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I was trying to type it out."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And I've thought about, there's other groups I belong to that aren't Buddhist groups."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "It does even Facebook if you're on Facebook."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Is that correct, Chris? Yeah, you know, and if you have some brilliant idea about this email me at the course address, they full path address, you know, and let me know and we'll talk among ourselves and figure out how we're going to do this in the next month or two."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Big hug, like together or wave or cheers, whatever."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And one of the virtues of having an excellent Dhamma teacher as a resident teacher is that there's an enormous amount of goodness that gathers around."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And so when we examine this in terms of our own personal lives, it's an interesting reflection of what that means."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So some of these very high-tech boilers were researched and purchased that are low emission and high efficiency."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And so I did, I waited, and everyone came down and we shared it together."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So we can see that the delayed reaction to having our needs met can also be the consequence around deeper joys being met."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So when we let go a little, we have a little bit of peace."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "When we let go of our habitual responses to our emotional reactions, there is a lot of peace."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "If we let go a little, we have a little bit of peace."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So it leaves us with an interesting question."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "But the general principle is not necessarily that difficult to see."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So this is a vase and used for flowers."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "It's most likely not going to be a water glass because they have different uses and they might be slightly conflicting in their purposes, right? But if somebody had the experience, now in either case, whether this is a vase or whether this is a glass of water, the experience is maybe pleasant, you know, nothing too distressing, yeah? But if you had the experience of somebody taking this glass and smashing somebody over the head that you loved so badly that they had to go to the hospital, then it's possible when you saw this shape, your whole system would go into a fear response because your association with this was an act of violence."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "It's the way that it's used, okay? So when we see the way that works in our own systems, we can begin to tweak this to our own advantage."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "We're really good at that."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Now, as reflective human beings, one of the things that we have is the capacity to choose where we place our attention."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And not having hair wasn't the big one."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Not going to help yourself in the refrigerator, that wasn't the big one."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And I'd come back happy as a lark."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Because if the monastic way of practicing is best, there are three monastics up here."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "What is helpful is to say, all right, this is an example of people who live with simplicity, who live with a minimal, who live with their needs getting met, but they don't use clothes and food and shelter in order to satisfy their emotional needs."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Well, either if you'd like to share about what it's like being a monastic and how different it is from being a lay person."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Food and shelter always means you have a special place and you are different."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So that's what I'm here now."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And I'm very grateful and it does work."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "We started discussing how much we were willing to uproot our careers."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So in terms of the path awakening, the first access to insight, the first direct penetration of the Dhamma, the uprooting of doubt, the uprooting of seeing rituals as the thing that's going to do it for you, the first uprooting of personality view where you take yourself to be a permanent and existing entity has within it consequences."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And yet sometimes there are situations where we find, if we're teaching, teen teaching with monks, there's this incredible adoration of the monks and somehow we all of a sudden become invisible again."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "This may sound very naive, but I have a question about the kind of, I don't even have the word for it, the reframing the example you gave of the glass that had become the traumatic instrument and being able to have the power within to re-objectify that."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Whether neurophysiologically, there are restrictions on some people to be able to, in fact, reorganize in the way that you're describing to be free of that kind of attachment and interpretation of some kinds of stimuli."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And so I go to work and I find that I can, in fact, be quite positive with her."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I always want to change the mind to reach out and stretch it to this limit."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And the first three days thought it was very good, you know, challenging."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I could not, I mean, all my body and mind say, this is not, I'm not going to allow you to do that."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And I reached out and I could break through it."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I'm still wanting to reach something."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "We do have to do that, actually."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And it's understandable that we have this, many of us we've learned this from family, from culture, from school, it's a society, it's a phenomenon."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "But there are a number of ways in which this inner critic impacts us and I'll just talk about a few here."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "We should only maybe express a small bit, not the whole portion of who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And in that kind of way it kind of like squeezes the sense of joy, juice or joy out of our practice, instead our meditation practice becomes burdensome and something we're supposed to be doing."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And get in the way of asking some deep questions of what do I really want for my life if the inner critic is really strong."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "We don't want to ask those questions, we're afraid that the next thing might be oh well you can't do it anyway."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "There is suffering, there are difficulties, things are unsatisfactory."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "So instead of allowing the inner critic to jump in really quickly and say this is not okay and because I'm uncomfortable it means that I'm doing something wrong, that I'm bad or something like that, some version of that."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "I'm a bad person because I'm a bad person or probably nobody wants to send me an email right."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "That's partly how the inner critic works, is it just grabs onto something and runs with it."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "They sent that email that way but as I pointed to earlier this recognition that there are so many conditions for every single moment."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Can we emphasize a sense of spaciousness or openheartedness related to our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "This attention with a quality of befriending."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "The screaming or the badgering the kind of this maybe insidious whisper that we hear."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Can drop in this question."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And that just asking the question."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Maybe the better question is."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "So some different ways that we might work with the inner critic is."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Or at least lessen the authority."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Don't feel the courage to make changes."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And when I listened to the talk, I said, this is awfully pedantic."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "When he gave his own descriptions of awakening, it was in terms of the Four Noble Truths and not in terms of the three characteristics."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Now actions, of course, are based on desire."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And that means understanding it to the point where you have dispassion for it."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So we are passionate many times for the things that actually cause us to suffer or constitute our suffering."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The Buddha never describes these as characteristics."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Why is that? Because they're unreliable and constant as my preferred translation for that."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "I think that's what the Buddha's pointing at."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And secondly, you can't depend on these things to be there for you all the time."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "You're trying to create a state of mind that is constant, that is easeful and is under your control."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "However, these teachings morphed as they got into the commentaries."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "A king would come into power."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Because after all, once the king sets a question, you can't say, that's a stupid question."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "We assume permanence in things that are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And this becomes the purpose of mindfulness practice, is just to see how impermanent things are."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Why do we suffer it? Because we think things are permanent, but if we knew things were impermanent, then we wouldn't suffer."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And when they describe the Buddha's awakening, it's described as the Buddha's seeing that things were impermanent, stressful that there was no self."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Excuse me, things are permanent."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Ultimately, there is no such thing as good or bad waves, such as waves coming and going."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The Buddha lived in a different period, we live in a new period now, there are new ideas of what we should and shouldn't do, and that's perfectly fine because after all, everything changes, everything is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Listen to that and I thought two things, one, that's a really French explanation of dependent chororizing."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Another person who was on the same show was advancing this idea."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "I think a lot of Vipassana courses are like that."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Why do we cling? Because we think it's worth it."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So let's go back and compare this again with the Buddha's teachings."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And this is not just physical food, but also emotional food, mental food."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "It's not inconstant, it's not stressful."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The image the Buddha gives instead of having you lying on the beach watching the waves come in, he says you're actually crossing over a river and you're going to be standing on firm ground where you are safe from the waves of the river."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The waves of the river can sweep you away, you want to get past."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And then you compare the type of happiness as possible."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "You're going out there and you're doing battle with your own stupidity."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "But I just have to be honest, and I've been maybe practicing for about five years."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Well, what do I say? John Mahabu had a great statement one time."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The question is, to what extent do you feel motivated that you're really going to say, I want this enough that I'm going to sacrifice other things for that."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And even if you don't get there, think of it as something that gives you some hope."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "People of all nationalities and genders and ages have found it in the past."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Who's rule is it? The Buddha's."}

{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Who had the mic? There's two mics."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The image they have is a stone column, 16 spans tall, 8 spans buried in the rock."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Like, you know, dependent chorizing is so easy."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Admirable friends are half of the holy life."}

{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "We might even interpret the practice instructions as saying that we should be doing this."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "There can be a space of receiving experience simply as experience, even when the experience is something that the mind believes is in the way of practice."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And yet we can actually just settle back and receive, oh, the mind is all over the place."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "The mind is trying to do, trying to get it right."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Feeling like it's not getting it right and judging itself."}

{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "As our minds get more and more information about what really is causing stress and suffering, those naturally get released."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "It begins, happiness cannot be found through great effort or willpower but is already present in open relaxation and letting go."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Why identify with and become attached to it, passing judgment upon it and ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Don't believe in the reality of good and bad experiences."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "I wonder if you could share maybe in the chat some clue as to how I could find a copy of that."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Maybe perhaps just the name of the teacher and the name of the piece."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "It feels kind of neutral, but it's distracting, right? And when I come back, I noticed a little bit of tightness, right? So what would you call those kinds of thoughts? Is that a version and clinging or is it just problem solving? It feels different to me than playing it, which is one of my favorite though too."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Yeah, that sounds really skillful to recognize that, that wholesome aspect of that, yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "I was, I'm just coming off of a retreat about that focused on the hindrances and the beneficial factors awakening and I'm working so closely with the hindrances for a week."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "I think I was thinking about that and then the, your theme of that you mentioned of, you know, not trying to make anything happen."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "You know, this maybe non nourishing mindset is here, I'm aware of it I'm accepting it I'm saying yes to it, you know, allowing it feeling it, but also doing it in a way that's not pushing it away."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "I'm telling myself not to."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And I would I would really just encourage there just to, you know, include just to include and notice like, Oh, this reaching for this tool to work with the end with this hindrance."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Maybe just like include this, this quality of maybe subtle, subtle aversion of just a subtle aversion to the hindrance and or some subtle kind of craving for or leaning towards some some quality some state that you are trying to kind of get to, which our minds are just always doing always doing."}

{"prompt": "Nothing Is Worth Clinging To", "completion": "No matter what you encounter, not that, not that."}
{"prompt": "Nothing Is Worth Clinging To", "completion": "So he says, if you can see it that way, all this is being impermanent, then that begins a process towards freedom."}

{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "Allowing some of these emotions to come up."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "That is, have you noticed that your energy increases when you're doing something that you love or participating in something that's really meaningful to you or something that you're devoted to or that you really care about? There's a lot of people who are volunteering as part of IMC and for many of them, I haven't talked to all of them of course, but for many of them they describe how it's meaningful for them and that it's uplifting and supports their practice and the energy is there to do some of the work even when it's not always fun or glamorous."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "And of course we have to do things in our lives that maybe don't have direct meaning."}

{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "Maybe it's not the exact amount exactly when we want it, but this is the most beautiful thing to do with our lives, right, is to apply our energy in a way that is meaningful for us, and that makes a difference for us, which of course allows us to make a difference in the whole world, and to support others, and maybe to heal some of this brokenness that we're seeing in the world, some of this brokenness that we're feeling in the world."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And so as we devote ourselves to being present, to being aware, the part of us, there's less energy available to be tense, to tight, to hold on, to cling."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "Sometimes we see what we're holding on to and we let go of it and something relaxes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And then we have a certain thought or memory and we feel tightening up someplace, maybe the whole body or we brace ourselves in some way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And so this Dharma that we stay close to is one of the meanings of Upanayaka, something to stay close to."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And it doesn't mean that we're condoning or celebrating and participating wholeheartedly in our attachments, but it does mean that we're not adding more suffering on top of it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And this is a beautiful quality, I think, of Dhamma practice, of this kind of acceptance, this kind of non-movement towards not being troubled by all the challenges we have, all the faults that we have."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And as long as we don't cause harm, it's fine to be who you are."}

{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And here comes a Buddhist monk, someone who has a high degree of spiritual maturation of peace, peacefulness about him."}

{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It's not a truth, not a metaphysical truth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It's a phenomenal process of a country that had tremendous civil war, tremendous atrocities that happened."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It just blows me away that that was a whole country that was dedicated to dealing with their past through that kind of process."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "So this idea of hiding the truth and speaking it."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "The most common definition of the perfection of truth in Buddhism is not speaking the truth so much as no longer deceiving, to stop deceiving."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I mean, that's, that's the eye trying to see through a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I can't stop it right and pretty impressive like, yeah, there's, there's no way out of this one, you know, is what it feels like and Yeah, I mean it feels like kind of a heavy burden."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And that that so that burden that you're talking about there is, you know, essentially, it is the, it's like a deeper kind of clinging around."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "You know, so, you know, the one thing that I found really useful around something like longing is really just seeing if you can let yourself be with it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And then the mind starts to see those threads of impermanent unreliable, not self, and the threads of the wishes for safety and well being and happiness for ourselves and others, and realize that they're not incompatible that they can weave together."}

{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So I recently just finished teaching a loving kindness retreat."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "For example, this whole idea of cultivating, building, developing might feel exhausting."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So those people tend to prefer kind of this idea of letting go."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "But to say a little bit more about what does it mean, this idea of cultivation practices that there are many parallels between cultivating the mind, cultivating the heart and cultivating a garden."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And we're just creating the conditions in which that potential can be actualized."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Because no matter what we do, we're cultivating something with this idea of neuroplasticity."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And so, of course, the Buddha encouraged us to cultivate those things that are going to be helpful, that are going to lead us towards this happiness and greater understanding and less suffering."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And chances are that you don't need me to tell you this idea that the Buddha encouraged us to cultivate ethical actions, to behave in the world in a way in which we don't cause harm, neither to ourselves nor to others, and sometimes that's not so easy."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And the Buddha also talked about, maybe before I leave this idea of causing harm, not causing harm, I'll add this, also to become sensitive to the ways in which the inner critic sometimes rises up and causes harm for the way that sometimes we talk to ourselves or some of the language or berates ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And this idea too, also with loving kindness and all the Brahmavihara's compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, also this unconditionality."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Which is great, there's nothing wrong with that and a vision of what's possible and an orientation of a direction we want to go."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "But then we end up kind of like tight and I've got this with my body because it's kind of how it feels."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "It can sound like a renunciation or surrender which can sound like deprivation."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "No, it's something different."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "It's kind of like this natural process."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So he meditated strenuously and just nothing happened."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So he gave up, went to bed, sat down on this bed."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So it was when he'd kind of relaxed, had given up this idea that things have to be a particular way, was maybe straining and striving and said, okay, I just can't do it and let go."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Through our life, our preferences have changed."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And we have different priorities in our older life that we didn't have when we were young."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Like, oh yeah, sometimes there's this sense of self, but other times I'm busy with other things and there isn't a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And it's in the service of creating this spiritual well of this inner treasure inside of us."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Be sensitive to that state."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Maybe something that's, I don't know exactly what's something that maybe we've been holding on to for a really long time that isn't helpful or maybe we don't even know what it is, but a sense of clearing out something uncomfortable or this sense of discharging or maybe even vomiting up."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Sometimes practice is painful and it feels like stuff comes up and maybe gets expressed with tears or gets expressed with nausea or something like this."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So this idea can maybe sometimes it's helpful to look at our practice in a simple, simplified way."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And in the 19th century, perhaps also, they modernized the whole thing a bit, put in plumbing and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And so I think particularly here in North America or in Europe, Buddhism has entered into our culture in enormously diverse ways, unlike in Asia or in a given Asian country where only one tradition really would have ever prevailed."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But I don't want this to be seen as a kind of aggressive destruction."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "That it actually is something that evolves and grows somewhat like an organism and here the architectural metaphor breaks down."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But I don't think that's been something that's ever been of any interest to traditional Buddhists."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Historical fragments scattered through the Pali Canon."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "One is that we're probably predisposed to consider the Buddha's awakening as a sort of mystical experience."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And there is also a tendency, perhaps quite pronounced in certain areas of our vipassana community, where we'll cite the Buddha and then we'll talk about Rumi, or some great Indian master, or Lao Tzu, or Jesus, and all of them we like to think have had a very similar experience."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But again, you see the deathless is a favorite in the Theravada school."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Ultimate truth, relative truth are part of the superstructure."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Namely, the Buddha's awakening was the awakening to the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And the good disciple is one who hears this sort of almost secret teaching from his guru."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Now the Buddha used this very word immortality, same word, but Western translators call it the deathless."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And since Buddhism is a bit skeptical about I, we think, mmm, that doesn't sound right, let's call it the deathless instead."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And I remember when I first came across this, I would always ask myself, why five? Why five khandhas? Why is this such a basic idea? Why doesn't he just talk about the body and the mind? And I think it's a similar move."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "The khandha of materiality, the rupa khandha, doesn't just refer to your body."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "When he describes the practice of meditation, particularly the meditation of mindfulness, which I think is his great contribution to the religious traditions of India, and perhaps we could even say humanity, meditation does not have to do with peering and focusing deep into the sources of one's soul, or one's mind, or one's spirit, but rather it's about experiencing more fully, more totally, the phenomenal world of our everyday lives."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "So he says, and this is the Satipatana Sutta, a monk who acts in full awareness does so when going forward and returning."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "We talk about being truthful."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "In other words, it's true because this is true because it actually makes a positive difference to the quality of your life in this world."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And also, there seems to be a fascination in the Vipassana community with the whole Vedanta and Vedanta teachers."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Gombridge published last year What the Buddha Thought."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "There are many of the teachers within the Vipassana movement in the United States and elsewhere who have worked and studied with the various teachers within Advaita Vedanta, particularly."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "So I want to go back to the notion of truth."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But I do accept that the passage that you refer to, the eights, is of considerable antiquity."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Now, you therefore have to ask, why? Now, is it because, in fact, he didn't really say this passage here, whereas he must have said that one there? I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But the working sort of hypothesis, or let's say the, if I use a very technical term, the hermeneutical criterion, one of the principles that I would use in asking, in giving more authority to some passages than others, would be, what is there in the canon that cannot be derived from the teachings and the culture of the Buddha's time? What is it that is distinctive? What is it that is original in what the Buddha said? And that's where I would make my starting point."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "That doesn't mean it's not true, but in terms of this project I have to trying to get back to the foundations of the Dhamma, it is something I would put to one side."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It's difficult for me to articulate this or to put it well, but I'm just wondering what the relationship is between one of these truths and morality."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "The advantage that atheistic tradition has is that it can claim that it's God, whatever that God might be, is, as it were, the foundation for what is good, what is true and what is beautiful, in the Platonic sense, for example."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Therefore, I do not harm the other."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "So it requires intelligence and wisdom as well."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It's a very good question and it's one that would take us off into something we could stay with for the rest of the day."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Could you pass the microphone to this gentleman with the glasses? Hi."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "That it was an emergent property that came about through the interaction between an organism and an environment."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And so his analysis of, well, I'll read you out a passage here."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "When consciousness arises dependent on eyes and forms it is reckoned as eye consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "When fire depends on grass it is called a grass fire."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "We feel that there is a consciousness kind of shining out from in here somewhere a witness that is not dependent upon these conditions it's just there."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And I think we need not to muddle that up."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "The person I think who probably dealt the death blow to Buddhism in India was Shankara Acharya who was the founder of Advaita Vedanta."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So last week we were interrupted by the elections."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And by becoming familiar with them, then they lose some of their allure, some of their seduction, some of the power they have over us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And this is a big topic as well."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And not just on retreat where I'm concentrated on meditation, but if I'm working on some writing project, for example, and I'm really concentrating, really focused on my project."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But because of the incessant movement of the mind being anxious and desiring and hating and doing all this activity, they're sometimes going to cover very, very deep kind of exhaustion in the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So there's those kinds of fatigues and kind of sleepiness."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "There's also a different kind of fatigue or tiredness or a fatigue with kind of drowsiness or dullness that can happen."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But also I've noticed in myself that there are other things I want to do."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And sometimes I've noticed when I'm wanting to do other things besides, then my mind sometimes gets kind of wary or tired."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So resistance can be a source of dullness in the mind or lethargy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And so there can be plenty of, we've gotten all the sleep we need and we're not tired that way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But adults, apparently adults do this also."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I'm not a believer in just kind of busting into the unconscious."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But if there's no caffeine of the soul, desire and aversion is not operating."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So there's plenty of people who associate meditation with getting calm."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "Some people as they meditate are soothing themselves."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And so if we follow the path of calm, or if we somehow sit too long and without enough energy kind of being aroused, then we start falling asleep, or getting duller and duller."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And it's something that meditators have to be very attentive of."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I've had the experience of kind of being somehow clear and not being sleepy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And then I would go to work and then I'd come back and meditate at 5."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And I think I was cleansing off the."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But that is another way of."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "It's a big bell, like this shape here, right? But, you know, ten."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And why I gave myself credit was."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "If I wasn't so sleepy now or so dull, what would I have to face? What would I have to experience is one that sometimes brings energy for people."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So, for example, if people use mental noting as a technique for mindfulness, you note what you're aware of, to note a little bit more vigorously in the mind, this silent vocalization in the mind, you note a little bit more vigorously, or you do mental notes more frequently."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "The chi is not there in the body."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "There was a period of time where I fell asleep every meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So, fatigue, sloth and torpor."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So I think it's really worthwhile taking a deeper look at your fatigue and tiredness and dullness."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But it kind of lends itself to kind of poor thinking, not thinking very well about what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And there are whole techniques around that where you hold the attention in that area."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And at that point it may be that some of the other sensations, like the pressure of the body against the chair, that that recedes."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Another analogy might be in the night sky on a dark, moonless night."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then it took a different, it took a different course, you know, the whole practice kind of went in a different direction."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Now, if those resolves are done with a kind of agreed, it's probably not going to play out."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "So again, not trying to do the expansion."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "I used this analogy of the bubble and the guided meditation with the sense of allowing that bubble to expand the kind of an image that might support moving in the direction of the whole body breathing."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "But I also found, I also found this request."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "I like that sensitive language."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "But Dhanasarabhiko and I hadn't particularly talked about using resolves like this."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And you know, what do you think, you know, I've been telling you, I'm using these requests."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And what do you think about that? And he said, oh, that's standard stuff."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "But internally we don't tighten up, we don't get tense, we don't get build up the stress and all the expressions of that in terms of, you know, the resistance or the anger or the blame or the running away or all the complicated things that can happen once we're into the world of behavior."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "And so to trust life is to trust that we get to be with ourselves, we get to be who we are, we get to be what's happening and then relax with it all, relax with it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "That allows us to have a different relationship with whatever is happening for us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "What's happening maybe is great, maybe what's happening is not so great or worse."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "I don't know how it is with any of you, but sometimes my first reaction to what's happening in the world and inside of me is not the wisest place."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Because sometimes don't, some things won't relax on their own."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Side by side with anxiety might be some love, some kindness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Trust that you can relax with it and then see what happens, see what unfolds, see what wisdom arises, see what finds its way in you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Find some nice appropriate challenge that you have and see what it's like if you can give it time and space and relax with it, soften with it, relax your belly with it, and see what else can surface and occur and move through you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "So you put together the notion of intentionally creating an action, even if it's just a thought, with the choice or the attitude of kindness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And as part of that, I'm going to be including some pre-practices that might be a little bit less commonly taught in insight meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "So unless you're sleepy, I really encourage you in these classes to take a really comfortable posture."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And let your thoughts just kind of fade to the background."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "They're allowed to hold a baby chick or a little furry animal in their hands."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "I've never done that before."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "Releasing any tension in your groin or your thighs."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "See if you can check in again on your internal posture, how you hold or relate to yourself."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "First of all, just a comment, a little bit relevant to what the last question was about."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Does what is impermanent give rise to happiness or suffering? Suffering, sir."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "It's built into the fabric of space-time."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "But the Buddha's suggesting we don't fully know."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "We don't really allow sufficient opportunity for stopping and going into depth."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Each breath is a signal of our mortality, of our fragility, of our vulnerability, that our whole existence depends on drawing insufficient oxygen from the atmosphere to oxygenate the blood, to keep the heart pumping, to keep the brain going."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The craving to me has a remarkable resonance with the idea in modern biology of how evolution is driven by the desire to survive."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And it's very difficult, in fact, to go against that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And this I think is one of the great things that I learned in doing the book on Mara, the devil, is that although the Buddha overcame the power of Mara on becoming the Buddha, that didn't mean that Mara stopped appearing to him."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The Buddha is a good enough psychologist to realize that these may just be momentary glimpses."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "He's at sovereignty and he says, monks, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The word is actually sila-bhata, which means virtuous conduct and vows."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "But I think the Buddha is actually saying something rather more radical."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "He's saying you become free on stream entry from regarding morality as a question of following certain legal prescriptions, following rules."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "You become free in the sense not of being liberated from something, but you become liberated to do something."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "I don't want to diminish becoming a monk or a nun because I did that myself and it was one of the most valuable experiences I ever had."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Now, most of the passages when the Buddha describes stream entry do so in the following way."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And we don't normally today associate stream entry with taking refuge."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "But the challenge is to be fully awake, to have confidence that you can actually do that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The eightfold path I think is the key to the Buddha's dharma."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And as the story pans out, in the end, getting into all kinds of crises, his world starts to fall apart, and his last journey, as recounted in the Mahaparanibbana Sutra, is really a story of failure at one level."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And there are not copies for sale here, but I've been given these little stickers, if I can open this package."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Oh, God, they're a bit tacky."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And likewise, Buddha nature, depending on how we understand Buddha nature, and again, there's enormous differences within the Mahayana schools."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "There is no equivalent to the word in Sanskrit, Buddha nature, it means womb of the Tathagata, or more usually, family of the Buddha, Buddha Gautra, not Buddha Swabhava."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "You know, I don't have a self and I've got Buddha nature."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "It's a very complex story, but I'm not suggesting, and I really want to emphasize this, that all of the superstructures somehow wrong, it's not."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "That goes off like pure land Buddhism, the idea that there's Buddha or Amitabha in some heaven somewhere and he's vowed for your liberation, you just have to recite his name and you'll be liberated after death."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "So it's really a question of differentiation, learning how to, but in order to do that, you need to be clearer about what the early tradition was actually saying."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "I think the for-truth doctrine has been tampered with, frankly."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But karma is considered very important and to get a little sense of its importance."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "They just kind of float along in life or something."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I didn't have to make a lot of choices."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And then I became a parent."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It's an ongoing process of change and movement."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And it's connected and the present moment is part of a causal chain of cause and effect."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And we see this great sea, the great, great kind of stream of cause and effect."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And we find ourselves here in the present moment in that stream of change of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And the question is how do we relate to this big sea of change of impermanence? Always things changing."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But one surprise was, I'll say it this way, in the monastery, much of the daily life was choreographed."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "You choreographed right down to which foot goes out the door first."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So there's a lot of, you know, it's well choreographed."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "That before, in a sense, the monastery was made for me."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Before I went to the monastery, I didn't know I had a choice."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But I found out actually there's a lot of choice because how I sat up, I could sit, I could slump, I could cross my legs, I could sit up straight."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I would say in a sense I was unconscious of the choices I made about how I sit in a chair."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And so I tried to pay very careful attention when I was attracted to someone or getting to know someone."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So karma in Sanskrit or in Pali it's kama is the usual meaning is action."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And so then there's all these action theories in India."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It's just biological conditions, you know, or it's genetic conditions or whatever."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And to be somewhat simplistic about karma theory, Buddhist theory, we go something like this, that whatever fuels an action, the fuel of an action produces more of itself."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And so you don't get your traffic ticket."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And we're just so busy living our lives that we haven't actually processed or finished dealing with certain events in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So the memories will come back and show that."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So the intentions that we live by affect give us memories."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I didn't know I held so much tightness in my belly."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "We're always trying to measure ourselves against others."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "We're always judging other people to make ourselves safer."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So what's often said about intentions is intentions are seeds."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "If we're always looking for the conditions of the world to be just right, your happiness will be fleeting at best."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And it forms in such a way that you're much more likely to discover a capacity for inner happiness."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So you want to be able to stop and look carefully at what is motivating this activity right now."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It's not about just giving information, right? Because, like, someone stops you in most directions how to get to San Francisco, and you just give them information."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "One of the great supports for the study of intention is your physical body."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So you can notice the tensions and the release of tensions."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "You know, you're going to do it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And if you keep doing it, you might be able to kind of refine it or take it to deeper and deeper levels."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So if you can live without fear, that is so I can connect in a deep loving way with other people."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So that's a, you know, well, that's actually a whole, that becomes a different thing than saying live without fear."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "My intention is to be quick."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And the primary way we do that is by working with our intentions."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "As we practice with intentional, you know, with good intentions, it becomes easier to practice with good intentions in the future."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It becomes easier and easier."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But more important, as we practice more and more with good intentions and have a sense of happiness and inner sense of well-being and peace, it becomes easier to let go of the things we're clinging to."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And some of the things that are hardest to let go of, you need help in order to let go of it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So how can we in a healthy way let go of that? And how can I let go of my self-concern and still be okay? Well, you can let go of your self-concern, your self-attachment, easiest if you're first happy."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Mind is not about anything."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "So what I want to teach about today, kind of a theme for these three talks that I'll give, I'm going to introduce with an analogy."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "Nature has become three-dimensional, almost like that."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "Smell that one, you know, smell the leaves and they have different smells."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And, you know, it's like, wow, I didn't know all this was here."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "You know, and feel kind of relaxed and open and it can be beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And that becomes richer and more valuable."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so you can really kind of get into the detail and it starts becoming alive in a very different way."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And sometimes our relationship to the inner landscape can shift and change as we get to know it better."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And they don't want to work."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "So how, but how to navigate in this inner landscape and to have learn, learn what's going on in there that really understand what's happening there in a way that supports the relaxation or the freedom is part of the art of all this."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And they're kind of like maybe butting their head against the wall, trying to meditate when, you know, it's not really the right match between their experience and what's going on inside."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "It's just recognizing or knowing specifically what's happening now."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "To clearly comprehend how that works gives me a lot more wisdom and understanding of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And one of the ways that's done in our tradition, the vipassana tradition, that sometimes some people find helpful is to use mental noting."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "Sometimes the naming of it, being a little bit more emphatic about it with using the note, keeps people connected, makes people more fully connected to the experience."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "It helps us to really see it."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so that's an active engagement of recognition, of knowing, of clear comprehension going on."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so with that injury, what's called for the attention is kind of much more active attention."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "They're just kind of stepping back."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "With observing, it's possible to shift and change how close you observe, the distance you have."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And what I'm trying to, and then a whole analogy about learning the plants was used to, I wanted to point to this, to make this point, that part of what the species, the ecosystem we're learning is in fact the different varieties of attention, qualities of attention we can have."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so you might, in the afternoon, that even during this lunchtime and lunch break, you might kind of relax, maybe more in the sense of observing, what forms of attention are operating for you at different times? If you are making some hot water or the hot water machine we have there, especially if you've never used it before, what forms of attention are you using to figure out how to make it work? How are you studying it? How are you looking at it? What are you learning? And are there times when you've finished eating your food and you're sitting there, do you switch to more in observer mode? How does attention shift and change in different settings? Maybe there's a loud commotion here in the building, and after a minute or two of it you realize you just were settled back in the observer mode."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "Or maybe you got into analyzing the situation."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Some people become quite happy learning about the Buddha's teachings on suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Some people become quite happy because they feel or understand that for the first time in their life, someone is actually talking about suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "I like that definition because it's interpersonal."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Different kinds, different varieties, different flavors."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Maybe there's a lot of experiences that come along with absence."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But if you say the goal is to be happy, well then maybe too many of us would try to smile too much."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And some people find it a little bit confusing because they're unhappy."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And we're calling it well-being."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "I'm fond of this word well-being."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So they kind of follow along."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And part of the reason to cultivate well-being, as I've said, is to put ourselves in a better place, to be able to experience, see, look directly at, feel the fullness of suffering, of our distress, our discouragement, our grief, our bitterness, our, you know, all these different things that could be called suffering or stress."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And it's a lot easier to do that if you show up for suffering with well-being, with joy and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That kind of penetrates and really presents for us and integrated in some way in us."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So a family of practices like that."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That's why perhaps Sela shouldn't be translated as virtue, because that sounds like something positive that you have and you cultivate."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And probably didn't occur to many of you to actually consider that and think, wow, look at that."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But if you put it what you're doing here in the context of what goes on in the world at large, it's pretty fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And so I feel so much delight that my speech now has changed."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It's so good to finally be present."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It's as if inherent in our system is a certain kind of happiness, well-being, joy, delight, something that's here, but it very easily gets covered over in ways that we can't see so easily, but they have to do with."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Another place where I saw the tiredness of this way of the mind works."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "I loved going to bookstores."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But I go into bookstores, and I would just love looking at all the titles and look at them."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And then I'd leave the bookstore after a couple hours."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And I would like to propose to you the idea, the theory, that you're actually a happier person than you realize."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But you know, if we have really good mental preoccupations, then we have better things to do, right? Than to feel that, you know, to experience the joy of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But if you are ethical in the right way, not clinging to the ethics or something, you know, that selfishness is not there and that preoccupation is not there."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And as we develop concentration, as we learn to recognize them and not be caught by them, the Buddha described the happiness or joy that can come from that in dramatic terms."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Someone who has a sickness, no longer sick."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So those are all kind of dramatic images."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "You're glad to feel, wow, this is nice, this is good."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That the condition for concentration is not huffing and puffing, not kind of bearing down, but rather it rises out of a modicum of tranquility, relaxation, happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "You're being carried along."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Like I'm surfing right now."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And then you kind of get carried."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "What replenishes it and refreshes it is there's an underwater spring in that lake."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "The inner causes for it are not being preoccupied, being able to be really present and concentrated in the moment, and being receptive and open in the whole physical system to be filled by something."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It can be very sweet and subtle."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "If I'm feeling sad or upset or something."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And so there's a lack of stability in that because I'm kind of caught up in the agitated or the work or the active part of life that's all about concerned about things."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "I feel like I have a floor or a foundation then."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So what I'm talking about today is not meant to give you more things to do, but more of what I hope is that kind of not exactly doing, but more to be open to or to be aware of maybe what you haven't been noticing yet."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Sometimes it's actually very important to feel the opposite and really."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "what has to happen for you in your processes, you have to really, for the first time maybe ever, really give up and suffer really well and not try to fight it or run away from it."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So may your care for yourself, may your interest in not causing harm to yourself and to others, be a motivation to quietly, peacefully touch, feel, sense, well-being."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "May there be well-being in your heart."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "Also, I think mindfulness may come with, at least for me, in learning about mindfulness, I learned about being mindful of things rather than having a sense of the experience of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So mindfulness wasn't there."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The intention to stop happened."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So there's a kind of a tracking of what's going on in the mind, tracking of experience."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So for instance, in playing basketball or learning how to play a piano or something, there's, you know, the wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "They kind of get embedded in us."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so the first place to kind of be curious, it's interesting to me that faith is the first on the list, usually it's listed as the first of the five faculties."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "You need to get some learning about how this works."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And then also some basic understanding about the practices that he's teaching."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But the tools that he offered us, this is the place for me where we need to gain some kind of confidence that yes, I can do this."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But for me, it was just a simple matter of willingness."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And again, this, this, this takes some remembering of this perspective at first."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And actually, when I read the suttas, there's only a very few places when the Buddha talks about cultivating concentration that he says, aim your attention at a particular object."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The stability of awareness with changing experience creates the conditions for, it's like each, each moment there's something new arising, each moment mindfulness meets it."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so that becomes a strengthening."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so they strengthen each other when we get those experiences, we get the taste of, for instance, seeing how the mind can release clinging and feel experience, the release of that clinging."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so not to try in that, not to beat ourselves up in that moment, but to just understand that these faculties, you know, kind of, they, they're stronger at times and weaker at times and conditions, conditions are at play in the, in how they are arising in any given moment."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The strength of mindfulness also, the strength of energy and mindfulness, sometimes we just have low energy."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And if we can align with that, sometimes we can find our way into almost a surrender mindfulness that can allow a cultivation of concentration, even with low energy."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "When wisdom gets really strong, when the wisdom is, you know, when wisdom and energy both are strong, the kind of sense of the Dharma energy being there, then it often, the experience is that it doesn't take the personal effort to engage."}

{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So what the mind was interested in observing."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So the wisdom, in one case, was interested in recognizing that the object and the awareness of the object are different things."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And if the mind is just oriented towards impermanence, it may not be experiencing suffering so much."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The mind is oriented towards suffering."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "We can understand the value and forget it."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But when we remember, and this is a way to cultivate confidence in a way is to reflect on remember the value of practice, remember how it has supported us."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And at least that's how I hear some people talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "But what do I find even more interesting about this, you know, Akaliko, this immediacy, the immediacy of now, the present moment, is that the human sense of how long the present moment is variable."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "More importantly, though, I think, is that as the sense of time becomes a little more extended, more leisurely, there's more space for the moment to be there."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "But when they're chronic in us and always there, it kind of leads to kind of stress and kind of a rapidity and a fast mind and a spinning mind, and probably a kind of tendency to create a lot of cortisol, maybe even adrenaline, stress in the body, stress systems in the body, stress hormones."}

{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "That experience too is part of this being."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "It's amazing that this simple thing that the Buddha pointed to, this simple tool of being aware of what's here in this moment, with the curiosity about what is this experience in this moment, and that's all that it is really."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And just kind of the surprise at the level of reactivity that was happening."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Some of it is conditioned based on our practice, based on our cultivation of that quality."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "So just reminding myself of that is helpful, reminding myself of that conditioned nature of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "It's interesting at times, you know, I think it's useful when we have sudden and strong reactivity, especially if this is in relationship to what somebody else is doing."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And then to ground yourself when reactivity is sudden and strong like that particularly, to really ground yourself in non-harming, in Sela, you know, to not act out of that reactivity in a way that would create harm, harmful speech, harmful action, not especially with speech to take care that speech is not harsh or divisive."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And so another thing I like to suggest people get, explore is, you know, get really good at cleaning up the mess."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "At least when I've really done that with mindfulness, there's a kind of a, oh, right, that's why it's so painful right now."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "But it can also be really useful to, especially if it's a situation that happens suddenly that feels like, wow, I don't understand what happened there."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "I've used it in exploring decisions to make."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Something that can be interesting or useful to explore in that place is, what actually is the mind reacting to? Is it what the person did or said, or is it connected to some history? Maybe both, you know."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "It's sometimes I've seen that, you know, sometimes I've seen it's definitely connected to what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Often I think when reactivity is strong like that, it's touching into some fundamental, some core things."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Things that are common, things that are human."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "So I always need to remind all of us of this because so much the teachings often point to looking here, you know, looking internally for how am I contributing to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "That's mindfulness, holding it."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Watching the moon at midnight, solitary mid-sky, I knew myself completely no part left out."}

{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And it's true, you know, this is one tool of mental training for the collection of attention and actually also for insight, the possibility of insight if there's awareness too."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So for example, sometimes you might have been on an escalator and you can sometimes see the shoes of the person who's in front of you on a different step."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And you can see that they're worn down in a certain way, you know, they're worn down either on the inside or the outside."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And then, you know, you can take up particular trainings that are helpful for you, just in the same way that you could decide to take up a training of being more flexible, take up a training of strengthening a certain group of muscles, you know, different things like this."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So you could go through it be like, maybe I need a deck chair, maybe I need a kumquat tree, maybe I need, you know, 10,000 rolls of toilet paper, you know, right."}

{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So I watched the College Women's Basketball Finals over the last couple of years."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And the path continues, too."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "I think there's a mic that goes around here."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "I practice a musical instrument."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "But I think there's different qualities of mine that are being cultivated in the time of practice."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And I haven't improved for like 20 years, though, I have to say."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "But even like with the, for example, with the examples of musical instrument or with playing sports, right, is like actually engaging in some kind of discipline allows you to strengthen those muscles or, you know, like doing the scales and stuff gives you the facility with that, that then allows you to play a musical piece that might seem more like play, you know, with more dexterity, or that actually allows you to improv better, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And, you know, it's like you could just do experiments with this, this is kind of like play, like, don't check it, don't check it anyway, you know, go through and then see at the end like what's in your cart, and you're like why do I have this, like whatever, you know, like, like observe the mind that's projecting these stories."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Like, what is it doing in Costco? You know, it's like looking at different things, it wants different things, or it's getting very selfish, or it's like, incredibly happy, or it's projecting, you know, like, what's happening in the mind? And even then, you know, what are the qualities of mind? Oh, like, here's distractedness is easily happening, like concentration is dissolving, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Or like, oh, look, it likes this food and not this food, or it enjoys this park, or, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So people who have this relationship with their pets."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "I'm switching over from this."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So then you're trying to, like, you could go and clean that up, or you could just pretend that it's not because you want to believe yourself to be more spiritual than that, or, you know, whatever."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So then it was like, come back, you know, in some way."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So in that way, just like seeing like, oh, these, what that means is just really recognizing like, oh, these are unwholesome states of mind, you know, like unequivocally."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "When you actually start to pay attention, there are really large swatches of time when we do not actually have to be directly engaged with the intellectual content of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "You're ten more years older."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "But what does that actually look like? What does it actually look like to let go? What is bound up in that process? And what I would suggest is what's involved in that process is often something like grieving."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And the truth is we don't even really have a choice but to love."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Now sometimes grief is a kind of, there's an acute loss."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "There is a kind of a poignancy in them, but there's just this sense of like, whoa, I feel like I'm grieving the suffering of my life, the suffering of the human condition, you know, the kind of sense of the loss of having lived in a certain way without knowing that greed, hatred and delusion were propelling my life, you know."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And so I feel like we actually as a country have this very precarious sense of who we are, of national self-esteem, and it's made precarious by our failure to fully own the devastation of history and the continued suffering that's disproportionately experienced by people in the country."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "There's that refrain of free from grief, sorrow, and lamentation."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "But with grief, I feel like it cuts even more deeply."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "It's like how we construct our emotional life, our emotional stability."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "When that is disrupted, when grief cuts deeply, it's so stunning to the mind, it's so jarring."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Like that has sort of a dismissed kind of, that mind state we have a very dismissive attitude towards in Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Like what dose can we take in right now? For a while the job is just to survive."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "There's a way in which, you know, we come up against places in practice in our lives where it's like the ego is all out of moves, you know."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Of not needing to hold on to all of the ordinary reference points of who we are, of what we are."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Expression of may I be safe, may I be happy, may I be healthy, this is an expression of meta."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And the teachings around refuge really point to a different direction, an alignment with understanding this truth, these truths."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "You know, it's not, it's this, it's this really, it's this interesting kind of almost knife edge of taking action, and yet not necessarily holding to or needing the consequences of those actions to be what we want them to be in order to be okay."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And how, how does this possible? The, the, the possibility of coming into alignment with these truths, coming into alignment with this impermanent, unreliable nature."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "It's quite amazing actually when, you know, at times my mind has, my mind definitely still rebels."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Refuge, you know, typically we think of, what we think of as a place of security is a place where we feel like we can trust."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And so the, the teaching of the refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and Sangha is essentially a teaching about trust."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "The Buddha, we, there's a kind of a conventional way to think about taking refuge in the Buddha, the person, the person who lived 2600 years ago, who discovered this path, found this path, and taught it."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "He is said to have reflected, wow, this is really subtle."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And so, so this is more the conventional side of it is kind of an appreciation or a gratitude that, that he became awakened and that he had the capacity to teach and express it and that he did."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "You're just kind of in a, in a bliss state."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "It's, it's just there, this possibility of being awake."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Because of our traditional definition of safety is often something like safety from unpleasant experience."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "One, one way to express it is what the Buddha taught, the teachings of the Buddha, the practices, the guidance that he offered."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "If we take in these teachings, if we hear these teachings and actually begin to engage with them, then there is some possibility of seeing how and why that capacity for awareness is useful."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "So the Dharma, the truth and the the refuge in the Dharma, you know, in just some simple ways to express it."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "There's a teaching that kind of really points to this."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "So what is the nature of experience? The Dharma is the nature of experience as impermanent, as unsatisfactory or unreliable as a place for lasting happiness because it's impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And the Sangha is kind of like the support, the nurses, the doctors, the family that takes care of us while we're sick."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "It opens us to actually see your experience, the nature of life as impermanent, unreliable and not so."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "They are a recipe for stress, the pain of clinging, of holding on to."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "A deeper sense of the refuge in the Dharma in the sangha is those people, whether they are monastics or not, who have actually realized something of what the Buddha understood, so that there can be this transmission and sharing that the lineage of the teachings has carried itself through 2600 years."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "When we do have an opportunity to come back together again, I think we will really feel that support, you know, the sense and the way that it's supportive to be with people who share this perspective and, and want to wake up in this way."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "That's so, that's a refuge in a way that we have this, this community to support us."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And so we can't just practice for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So the five hindrances are the narrow description of them."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "They are sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So for mindfulness students, it's very important to study these and get to know them well so that they lose their power to hinder."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Often people's attitude towards them is that they shouldn't be there, they're unfortunate and people like to get over them very quickly."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And I'd like to encourage you, even if you feel troubled by them or hindered by them, don't get over them quickly."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And even when people have the so-called experience of awakening, the Buddha always followed that with understanding, when it understands what that's about."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Understanding is very important."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "I wanted to study Gestalt therapy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "You can desire well-being for your family, your neighbors, your world."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "I would just look at all the books that I, you know, just look at all the books."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Desire is such a big part of human life that I think that rather than calling people human beings, they should be called human desirings."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Or, you know, imagine, you know, like their bodies split open."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "It might have been, might have been a good thing to have done in that circumstance."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Many times we think that there's no dangers or we think, oh, no one will notice."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "There can be a very deep, I like it that the word English word wanting has a kind of double meaning."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "But also we say the soup was wanting salt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So what are the conditions? So there's conditions inside of us, but there's also conditions in the world around us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "But then the mind is filled with those pictures."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So as I said earlier, this hindrance in the Buddhist teaching is particularly the hindrance of sensual desire, desire for sensual pleasure, which might seem initially kind of a lightweight kind of thing, but it doesn't take a lot of reflection to realize the tremendous grip and power that sensual desire has on human beings."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "To mention just one that's often mentioned, I think, often enough, is sometimes men refusing to wear condoms because it decreases their pleasure."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "It's not denying that those things are appropriate at times, it's okay to do it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "But sometimes there are reasonable desires to have."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And so rather than disadvantage of the object, what we want, we might look at the disadvantage of the pursuit."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "There's suffering in that situation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And there are motivating forces that can produce fantastic things as well."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Big Mind", "completion": "Now shift your attention to listening to sounds."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "And so we have pleasant feelings, painful feelings, neutral feelings."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "The Buddha said the very fact that this body experiences physical pain is that with that comes discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "The second arrow we can dodge."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "If we are mindful, if we are awake, then we can avoid the second arrow."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "It's like that even though we might experience physical pain, the mind can be completely at peace with that."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "And bringing the mind to that and say the feeling of pain in the knee, then they can notice how much the body tenses up against that so that we feel pain and so then the body resists that and stresses as a natural reaction to physical discomfort."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "So to have loving kindness doesn't mean to say that we're trying to pretend that we like pain."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (3/5) The Importance of Insight into Impermanence", "completion": "So impermanence really is the foundation for realizing dukkha and anatha for the other two, the other two marks of existence."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "And so, in a way, the necessity for monasticism outlined in the first place in traditional cultures is no longer there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "I think there's big dangers in that for some of the reasons I won't go into which I outlined this morning."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Our proclivities to behave and think in certain ways."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So Sankaras, we're always setting up Sankaras and operating out of the Sankaras."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Even if the end result is further misery or whatever, I don't usually think about it because better to know what the outcome is going to be rather than to engage in something new which is difficult and not know what the outcome is going to be."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "This is what we're dealing with."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Actually, Buddhist lists are a wonderful recycling mechanism."}

{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "The other theory he was critical of is that everything that occurs is accidental, that things just happen randomly, whatever way and therefore we don't really have much say about what happens, just accidents happen to us, things happen randomly and we have no involvement, no possibility of entering into the stream of activity, cause and effect and make a change."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "So to say that the self is responsible and only the self is putting some singular point of responsibility and denies the field of cause and effect that comes into play, and it's the same thing as if you blame someone else."}

{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Any particular activity oils the wheels of hate or anger or fear, or oils the greases of generosity and happiness and kindness."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "So it might be that you kind of reinforce certain tendency to be angry in certain settings, and that setting doesn't occur for 20 years, but then it occurs, and that seed is right there, and a little bit of anger can create huge disasters in a person's life."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "It contributed, had a contributing effect, but I don't think I would have kind of got to blame myself for it particularly, but it was very, it was important, it was very important to be aware of how my intentionality affected, was, or it was playing itself out and had an external kind of result in a sense, but what's the most, or interesting is that the accident didn't happen, but my unhealthy intentionality was still there, still operating."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "They're going to unfold in, in, in relationship to what happens around you."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "We're not looking for gods to do it or the equivalent of it."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Maybe some of you are new, but at least have done some Vipassana meditation."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So does that make sense? You can see how that maps on to the process of insight meditation and how the more fully and deeply that insight is rooted, then the more that quality of coolness, that quality of Nibbana is realized, is manifested."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Mind, again people use it in different ways."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But more often in ordinary everyday usage people tend to think of mind as the thinking mind."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "People have written whole books on what's the difference between mano jitta and vinyana, mind, heart and consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So the mind as a sense organ, like eye perceives light, ear perceives sound."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So but within the general Buddhist vernacular then we don't, at least in the Theravada world, the idea of a big self or a self with a capital S is generally not used."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So I would say that at the moment that the heart is free from grasping, then there is the possibility of realizing deathlessness, not as a sort of total enlightenment forever experience but just in that moment then that quality of the deathless or the transcendent qualities of our nature can be realized because it's the grasping that's obscuring it and so that in that moment when there's no grasping right there in that peaceful open quality then that can, I wouldn't say that as soon as the mind stops grasping then Nibbana is fully realized but that's like a momentary Nibbana is right there."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "I mean that's a somewhat sweeping statement but it's pretty accurate and that also is what you can notice in meditation that when you say you take hold of something like this, like this bell striker and you're in state of tension, you're grasping it so like my arm is shaking, my body is agitated as a tension even as I'm speaking and then you stop."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "You have to develop that, oh look, there's no dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "It's a place of no thingness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "It's embedded and so that the levels of enlightenment like stream entry, once returning, non-returning and arahantship are those benchmarks whereby that insight is so deeply rooted and the ephemeral nature of experience is so clearly understood that you can't unsee that."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And to the degree that I was willing to let go and not allow myself to be labeled as giving up too soon that I was still young in my career, things started to happen in a very positive way."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But that kind of experience where everything comes together and life seems grand and before the glamour wears off."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so the Buddha would talk about that sort of thing as that Samadhi or the strength of concentration is suppressing the hindrances, the kind of language."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And that's all still waiting because you're currently running on this particular sort of enthusiastic splurge."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So that's talked about quite a lot."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Isn't it true? On retreat we often talk about the subject of Nibbana comes up."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "If you're thinking of something to attain, the state of mind it's taking you away from being present."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so shade and coolness is deeply attractive."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And it's a kind of counterpoint, because the yogis of his time and today, a lot of their ascetic practices and self-mortification was around generating what's called tapas or heat."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So the Buddha was being kind of shocking and revolutionary."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "I said, no, no, no, we don't want tapas, we want nibbana."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "2 that Ajahn Tanisaro cites here."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Nibbana, which literally means the extinguishing of a fire, derives from the way the physics of fire was viewed at his, the Buddha's time."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And then the next passage."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So when the Buddha uses the word, he was brilliant in his use of language."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Now another definition, a set of definitions that we have here is a lengthy passage, but I'll read it out because it's Bhikkhu Bodhi being incredibly brilliant, as he almost always is."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "The Pali Canon offers sufficient evidence to dispense with the opinion of some interpreters that nibbana is sheer annihilation."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "The existence of which makes possible escape from the born, become, made, unconditioned."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So there are actually five noble truths."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Above all, nibbana is the cessation of suffering, and for those who seek an end to suffering, such a designation is enough to beckon them towards the path."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And then many of these passages we'll revisit during the course of the day, but I felt that was a really superb synopsis of these main teachings about that and gives also a healthy overview of those different dimensions."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And I never would have imagined a quote from Yogi Berra in a Buddhist book."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And I'm not sure how many people here are familiar with Yogi Berra, but he was his famous manager for New York Yankees and a player."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So the first part is definitions."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so there's a whole chapter here, chapter five, called to be or not to be."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So there's many teachings in there."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so the teachings on not-self, because as everyone here has been involved in practicing Vipassana meditation, insight meditation, you know that this is in a way the main engine of wisdom development in Buddhist practice is exploring the insights into unsatisfactoriness and into uncertainty or change and also to not-self."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Whereas Dukka and Anicha are unsatisfactoriness or suffering and change, transiency or uncertainty, these are pretty easy tangible concepts to get the mind around the whole realm of not-self."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But I thought with today also you could look at some of the sutra quotations that refer to that same teachings on not-self and how the Buddha really pinpoints this as of all of the different kinds of clinging that obstruct the realization of nirvana, that all the upadhanas that are there, probably the most subtle and tricky is what's called atavad upadana, or the clinging to the concepts and constructions of self, of atta, or atman in Sanskrit."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha arrived in town late in the evening, didn't have a place to stay, couldn't get to the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So he stayed in this, asked to stay in this potter's firehouse, and there was already another yogi, another wanderer, staying there."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "That's one of the instances where he talks in those terms."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "These are tools which we use to unpick presumptions that we make about life and about who and what we are."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so these basic characteristics of existence in Ichiduka Anatar, these are tools to support that quality of investigation."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So when this teacher, when the Buddha says, I am is a conceiving, I am is an affliction and so forth, he's pointing to that way that any."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And what is Sati Center? Sati Center has."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So exactly like Sutty Center."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Sutty Center has only metaphysical but not actual existence."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "You say, good morning officer, and you hand over your license, which has got a name on it."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So we're not trying to annihilate an already existent self, we're more like just seeing through the conjures trick, and just seeing that who and what we are and what is is actually much bigger and more multi-dimensional than we have actually think things are."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But the Buddha taught the four noble truths in that format because it's mapped onto a traditional Indian form of medical diagnosis."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "What's caused the ailment? The third one is the prognosis."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "To work with the first noble truth, you need to work the path as well."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "One of the aims or hopes for today is to get a sense of."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "We are all siblings in birth and death."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "It's an interesting thought, right? Look around actually for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "It's a truth, it's an awareness, it's a practice we often like to avoid."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "And then some of the immortality stories that we tell ourselves, which are very prevalent in the culture and in the way that we consider our mortality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "Anyone familiar with Denial of Death? A bunch of people."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "Human being is literally split in two."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "There are many supplements."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "There are lots of supplements."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "Do they resonate? And not good, not bad, just a sense of, oh yeah, this is true."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "The third immortality story we tell ourselves is the story of the soul."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "I want to live on in my apartment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "And it's not so foreign, it's part of our lives."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "And if, if the idea of it makes you queasy, there, there are other ways to do this contemplation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "I remember actually a few years ago as part of, there was a training that, that, that Gil leads every year, chaplaincy program."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "The Indian Ocean tsunami turned out to be one of the most devastating national disasters in recorded history, leaving an estimated 227,000 dead and 125,000 injured, 45,000 missing and 1."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "In the idyllic tropical setting, the day after Christmas, who could have imagined that this will be the day that I die? Consider that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "Our minds are habituated to relate to suffering by resisting it through blame, bitterness, anger, resentment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "So much additional suffering comes from believing that things shouldn't be this way, when in fact they are that way."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "So I invite us to consider our reactions to death, considering it as an injustice, somebody's fault with blame, bitterness, anger, resentment, or that it's natural and it's nature."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "So I'd like to turn our attention to the time that is left."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "And how do you bring the scarcity of time to your consciousness? Anyone? Mindfulness of death."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "This one is for the sake of our loved ones."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Death", "completion": "She knew what was going on."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "He said in the same way, try to make your mind non-reactive to pleasant and unpleasant contacts."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "In other words, he's giving instructions in equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "But the Buddha is not saying that."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The technical term here is directed thought and evaluation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Perception is the way you label things, the notes you give to them, the way you picture something in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "He said, maybe you can change something in the way you breathe, maybe you can change something in the way you talk to yourself about it, or maybe you can change the way you perceive the situation or feel about the situation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "You know the old definition of neurosis versus psychosis? A psychotic field believes that 2 plus 2 equals 5."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "A neurotic knows that 2 plus 2 equals 4, but hates them for it."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "In the midst of anger, in the midst of grief, or in the midst of lust, just ask yourself, the suffering that I'm causing, that I'm experiencing right now, is part of that due to the way I breathe."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "See if that affects the situation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Now, you realize if you try to scoop up the water, it would make it muddy."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "You say, look, I need this."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Third thing, you can start questioning yourself."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And the grandmother was weeping and wailing and he kept thinking, this is not helping my dad at all, having her in the room like this."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "That's what I like about the Pali canon, they get really frank."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And it so happens that he doesn't die, he recovers."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Think of your mind as a committee."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Some of the committee members are going to be on your side and some people will resist."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And here the Buddha has, you remind yourself that even feelings are fabricated."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And he says, given the fact that your feelings are fabricated, there's an habitual element in there, there's an intentional element in the feeling, to what extent is this actually helpful? And because they are fabricated, I can change them and adjust as real if they're changed."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The way our mind interacts with the world, our mind is actually basically active."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And so you want to be able to see that in action."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Watching with, but as I said, equanimity itself is a fabricated state."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "You see this in many ways."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Because after all, the fourth jhana, you've already got pure equanimity and you're not there at nirvana yet."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "In other words, whatever comes up, you determine in your mind that whatever you see or hear or smell or taste or touch or think about, the mind is going to remain steady."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Now this is the same kind of equanimity the Buddha was teaching to his son, when he was talking about making your mind like earth or water, fire or wind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "You have to work with your breath."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The Buddha said, this is a sign of a person of no integrity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The Buddha is talking at one point, Ananda, and he's talking about getting the mind all the way up to the state of neither perception or not perception."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "It's only then that you can get beyond it."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So equanimity is not nirvana."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Rapture will happen and then it will pass away."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "See how they come, see how they go."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So you can understand them."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "First thing you start with ignorance and then you go to fabrication."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Can you change the dialogue? Can you raise new questions that you might not have thought of before? And then finally, look at the mental images, the perceptions you are holding in mind about this particular situation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "How you can perceive it differently."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Where can I change this? The element of control here."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So, that's the talk for today."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Now think about breath energy coming in through your back."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "There is a book called Wings to Awakening which has a section on equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The way I learned to practice jhana is to always focus the breath right at the entrance to the nostrils and to keep it there."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And in the same way that you would work water through bread dough, you work water through this dough."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "But if it felt more natural to be in, say, the heart chakra instead of at the nostrils, that would be okay? That's perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So you can practice going back and forth until it settles, and you've got both things together."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "Sometimes that's helpful just to kind of know where you are, where you're starting from."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "And how we are in relationship to this moment is a powerful condition that shapes the next moments of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "Taking the attention out of the content of the thought more to, how am I now in this moment, having been thinking that? What does that affect that thought has had? Has it shaped tension in the body? Has it shaped emotions? How are you right now? That's our basic practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "How is this being right now?."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And I said to her something like, you know, we'll start letting go after we cling."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "So freedom is very closely linked to non-clinging in this tradition."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so when we start practicing, we start to see how we live."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And maybe especially some of the habits that get us into trouble."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "There's no suspension of the different streams of momentum."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so naturally, we can't help but reiterate our clinging."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "That the way we practice in some ways is going to be a re-expression of how we cling."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Yesterday Gilles said something like, we hold all the ways we're not free with an open hand."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Miles Davis said, if you're not making a mistake, it's a mistake."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And intrinsic motivation is an activity we're doing for its inherent satisfaction."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "We practice for all of these outcomes."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "But part of how I hear it is it's to really deeply honor and celebrate intrinsic motivation."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Practicing freely is supported by an attitude of humility."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "We really can spend our whole life mesmerized by the kind of shell games of ego, of arrogance, which inevitably brings into being self hatred."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "There's another component of humility, which is something like a recognition, a deep recognition of the contributions of others."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And he kind of like gently sort of probed to figure out what, what this whole situation was in front of him, very, very sweet."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "We say things, we do our, our song and dance to try to spark intrinsic motivation, but ultimately it's in your heart, right? That's by definition what makes it intrinsic and not extrinsic."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "We practice freely when we find the right rhythm of self-evaluation."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "You know, when I was doing, before I was doing Dharma stuff full-time, I was in clinical research and we were doing clinical trials around medicine to help with addiction."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "I don't know if that's true, maybe it's exaggerated, but just that thought really can help us relax."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Yeah, you can actually, you know, one of my teachers, Shinsan Young said, like, we develop a taste for purification."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "It's like, okay, I'm, I'm, maybe I'm happy enough."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "I was in, I've done very little Zen practice, but a little, and it was in Doka-san interview with a Zen teacher, and, and as not somebody I knew, knew well."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "I have a couple announcements for auditors signups with Inez or have been posted for for Wednesday through Saturday and on the main retreat page and just so as to ensure space for for everyone who wants a slot."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Yeah, let's practice as as freely as we as we can, knowing to some extent we must use the ladder of clinging and then put that aside as we grow and deepen in our freedom."}

{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "You have to do a ritual formula right."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Many times you'll see books on Buddhism that don't even mention karma."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So I'd like to go down these four categories, the content, providence, the status as a belief and the motives for believing and sort of take it apart and see exactly what the war on karma is saying."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And the results of the past actions are only one of the three because after all karma in the Buddha's teaching is intention."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Suppose it was something negative that you did."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "He says there are times, however, when you get to the way you create a sense of self, it's going to be unskillful, and that's when you start using the teaching on not self."}

{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "In terms of karma as a belief, this is attacked in two ways."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Well, think about that for a minute."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Buddhism is very much something that you do, therefore your beliefs about human action are very important."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Therefore, because karma can't be empirically proven, therefore it must not be a genuine teaching."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And also, secondly, you find people believe you more."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Your words are going to carry more weight."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So that's where you've basically completed the pragmatic proof of the doctrine of karma."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Go around for a while saying, okay, my actions are important."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "It basically comes down to two."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "The idea of having to wait for another lifetime, that's kind of discouraging."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "But still, the result of that action is an impersonal thing."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "This is one of the reasons where karma is not all that consoling."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "If you're going to act, which is what something we're doing all the time, you have to have a particular kind of belief."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "They had to throw this in and say, whoops, never mind, that's not how it happened."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "This is intrinsic to the whole path."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "But it does have an effect."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And it's precisely this, what you're doing in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "I was reading an interesting article a while back."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And here was somebody who was asking politely."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Again, it's not forcing you on this, but it's like when you go into a laboratory, you have to have certain working hypothesis that you're going to test."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So I don't really understand, for example, what might it look like if you gave that a try and you want to experiment with that for a while? Well, say that you find that you're really drawn to doing something you know that you shouldn't do."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Most of the religions, the standard religions do help people in their lives."}

{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And it turned out somebody years back had said, there are only three or four things that really are a sign of a heart attack."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So the lesson from that is, when you want to solve a problem, don't clutter up the issue."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So you begin to see there's a lot of subtle decisions and subtle choices going on in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Now, if karma were not radically important for all your experience, that wouldn't happen."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "That's a very relevant and necessary hypothesis."}

{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "I love teaching this topic and practicing with emotions has been a very central, rich part of my own practice."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "And emotional life is such a, it's a subtle and broad and rich thing to notice, even, you know, noticing how our emotions show up in our body."}

{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "That is certainly something that is on offer when we engage with our emotional experience within our meditative practice, more, more equanimity, more distance, more clarity."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "It felt to me I was very much kind of ruled by it, you know, it's that was something that I didn't have a lot of skill and freedom with."}

{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "It's also how maybe we are afraid to be seen due to, you know, how we know other people are viewing us."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "You know, there's a lot that comes in."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "So are there some ideas hanging around there that may be limiting to us? What does an awakened person look like and what range of emotions can they feel."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "Or maybe we want to be able to just simply feel untangled or not so, not in knots with our emotions."}
{"prompt": "Emotions Pt1 - Introduction", "completion": "What relationship would you like to have with your emotional life? What do you want from your emotions? All of us have our own way that we are with us."}

{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "And delusion is probably a term that those of you who have been coming to Dharma talks or listening to them are pretty familiar with."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So it's considered this kind of conceit not only to think that you're better than other people, actually also to think that you're worse than other people."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "That also is a form of conceit."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "The third one is even more perplexing."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "Yeah, actually everything comes together because of different causes and conditions."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "Now you can notice in the body more easily maybe that the body is part of nature."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So what kind of food you eat or how much you stay in the sun or how much you exercise also shapes your physical body."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So right now we might all be made of Hetch Hetchy water, but I actually just came back from the East Coast so I'm partly made of New York water now, you know, from that time."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So just seeing that, seeing how this arises, not just in your practice, formal practice, but actually just in your life, is very helpful to cut through this sense of, oh yeah, here's this sense of me and my separate self."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So it's just humbling to see that, you know, and there's some of those patterns that are neutral, there's some of those patterns that are more wholesome, there's some of those patterns that are more unwholesome."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "But it's a sense of sureness based on a false idea that we are actually in control in a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So this mana, this comparing, it's kind of like a, the delusion is really like a very slippery character, so to speak."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "And so it was funny, she thought it was funny too."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "I think humility also requires a lot of honesty, you know, truthfulness, which is actually a piece that's highlighted in the path, right? And it requires this mindfulness, this ability to be present, to see things just as they are."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "But the act of actually giving, of actually opening your hands or of renunciation is a powerful act of training yourself in this humility."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "Or even some of the practices that we have in the Buddhist centers."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "But I do appreciate that moment when everyone has to take off their shoes and actually walk through this little gateway, you know? And no matter how, you know, if you're a big businessman or you're, like, some hippie traveler, everyone's got to take off their shoes and walk through that."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So you can try that and see, you know, those of you who are sort of allergic to the bowing, I encourage you, even if it's sort of privately in your room, like, just try it sometime and see what it feels like."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "I think I'm better than other people."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "Thank you so much for this wonderful, wonderful Dharma talk."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "And actually, you know, even that question about like what is quote unquote our voice."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "And also, you know, that mysterious uniqueness that does manifest through us."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "You know, and there's a sort of, even in seeing that in someone else, but then sort of just being like, oh, I'll just let that go when there is something that I could point out."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So, you know, in this tradition of Buddhism, there's different stages of enlightenment that one goes where different things are released."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "There was not this political process where it's all me, me, me, and I'm going to do this and this and this."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "And they would actually go and they would avoid the prideful people."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "There's someone back there."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "I make mistakes like a lot and that's just my own patterns and conditioning and doing the best I can."}
{"prompt": "Humility and Delusion", "completion": "So appreciating the opportunity to come together as a Sangha and reflect on the teachings of freedom, liberation."}

{"prompt": "Instruction: Concentration", "completion": "Calm, stable at peace with the sensations of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: Concentration", "completion": "So, if at times you get very distracted and you want to return to a single object such as the breath, trust what feels right to you, allowing mindfulness and investigation to balance your practice."}

{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "There's a world that's kind of out there, whatever that might be, beyond you."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "But what I propose, as you sit with your little group, that don't say everything you can possibly say."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "And you might find yourself saying something completely new after it's gone around a few times."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "You know, I don't anticipate any of you are now going to, every time before you move or speak or scratch your nose, you're going to sit for 45 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "But what would life be like before all kinds of important things you actually sat for 45 minutes? Even then, you're not going to do that, unlikely."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "So for some people it's phenomenally liberating."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "But what some people learn is then they see what a big impact meditation has on their daily life."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "Yes, so I think one of the things that I've learned with meditating and thinking about just the experience of it is to, you know, things just don't always go well."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "So if it goes poorly, not to just give up, like you don't give up on the cushion, just either that or you just sit there until the bell rings."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "I was just going to ask if you could repeat a what caused by an unmet need? Sorry? Oh, it's a Buddhist concept? Unskillful actions, unskillful speech."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "Just a few hours ago, I was reading a book by Shenzhen Yang called The Science of Enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "That's really ideal, you know, to only rely on meditation to kind of, you know, keep you going in a calm way or clear way or balanced way, which is great."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "We learn about a state of mind or a way of being or how to let go or how not to be caught up in things."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "And then the art, you know, to make it really come alive, it's to take the lessons of meditation and begin seeing how this play out in daily life and how to replicate some of the aspects of meditation in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Your World Begins With You", "completion": "So, for example, that's why this exercise, you know, what do you learn from 45 minutes of meditation about what you value, what your priorities are, what place inside of you do you want to be in touch with when you speak and act? How do you want to see and look and show up and be present for the world around you? Meditation might give you a very different sense of that than if you spend your day at the mall or something, I don't know what to, you know, or if you're in a very fast-paced, ambitious work environment where people are always kind of running and pushing and trying to get ahead."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour:  I Am Here, Now -- For A Limited Time", "completion": "Since your Sangha, what would be helpful to bring up this share? We're really close."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour:  I Am Here, Now -- For A Limited Time", "completion": "And I just signed up for your course also."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour:  I Am Here, Now -- For A Limited Time", "completion": "And I don't know if there's a."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour:  I Am Here, Now -- For A Limited Time", "completion": "Like, wow, this is working."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour:  I Am Here, Now -- For A Limited Time", "completion": "Even before I turn into the Buddhist, you know, the Buddhist said on his deathbed, which again, talking about death and clear important message, be a light unto yourself."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "It was about seeing what's in front of us and accepting it."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "And you look at it, and I call it soft eyes."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "Any other insights? Yes? Yeah, thank you for that."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "It really does require, you know, very dedicated diligence."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "So the Buddha said there's a very big difference between just doing something on automatic pilot, you know, just moving along on the day and, you know, maybe helping somebody get a cup of coffee is an antidote to kind of self-absorption or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "I mean, it is powerful awareness."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "If the intention is to view those ruminations as mental events."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "You know, you're saying I'm going to, you know, that's an intention."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "It's the knowing what your motivation is."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "So, that is another definitely level."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "But I also would just like to raise the awareness that we have an intention to do something."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "So, the intention to see the misery, to feel the misery, you know, to know the misery, okay, it releases us to experience an alternative at some point."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "So, you know, I talk about the mindfulness as medicine, but it's also a form of therapy because it's a self-reflection."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "So, you know, what would that intention be to offer that, you know, armor, you know, just some space to just see it, not trying to kill it or chop it off? And so, particularly in the West, by the way, one of the great revelations to me when I was in Thailand is that they think differently than we do."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "I mean, maybe they're jealous, but it's their, their, you know, they're not great ruminators."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "You know, if you hear me gossiping about, you know, if I gossip to you, then what's the next logical conclusion? Who else is it going to gossip to? There's no safety, you know, which is another form of kind of losing your dignity, you know."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "I just, you know, instead of taking it on like the, you know, her burden, I just said, well, you know, yeah, it's really a difficult time, but I'm not going to make it worse."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "And, you know, there's lots of studies on it and the, again, it's not the judgment, it's just, it increases the pain and that, you know, intention just to see the pull towards numbing out, you know, with food or drugs or sex or whatever is a really good intention to observe."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "It's like, if you, if you make, if you plant these seeds of unhappiness, it's usually going to make you feel terrible, you know? So, regret."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "You know, I will do something nourishing."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "To the extent that I'm able, I intend to observe and practice the precept of generosity, the generosity of awareness and clear-seeing with myself and others."}

{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "A couple years back I had a visitor at the monastery, someone who's been around the Dharma scene for quite a while, and she said, you know, I know that Nagarjuna and the Mahayana teach a lot about emptiness."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "The question is, well, what does emptiness have to do with us? You know, if you were attached to this glass, would you be attached to this glass because it has an inherent existence or you'd be attached to the glass because it can hold water that you can drink? The question of inherent existence really doesn't have much to do with why we're attached to things."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And so the question is, what does wisdom have to do with talking us into doing things that we know will be of benefit and to talking us out of things we know will be of harm."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And it's related to the Buddha's teachings to his son, Rahula."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And the Buddha comes, washes his feet and he leaves a little bit of water remaining in the dip."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It gets the person out of the way and you look at the actions just in and of themselves in terms of cause and effect."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And then you're not ashamed to talk it over."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You might call this, instead of self purification, it's action purification."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "The Buddha actually has three different meanings of emptiness in his teachings."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "One is emptiness as you approach to meditation, how you approach the practice of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And then the Buddha explains the word dwelling in Pali can also be used to mean approach or attitude."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And what the Buddha describes is not only where his mind stays, but also the approach you use in getting it to stay there."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Allow yourself to indulge in that reflection that you're now in the wilderness."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "He said, then reflect on it."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And they describe some monk going through progressive states of concentration."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "The things around you are earth."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It in and of itself still is a modicum of disturbance, because you've got to maintain it in mind."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "The concentration is an action that has a certain effect on the mind, and instead of, in this case, talking about harm, the Buddha talks about disturbance."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "There's space penetrating the atoms in your body, and if you can get the meditation so that your breathing is still enough so that the breath stops."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It spreads through everybody."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "There's no end to it, and you can put your mind in that perception."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Then the amount of disturbance from being in wilderness or being in the village, that's gone too."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It builds on the same principles of one not wanting to harm."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "But you can't say that it's focused on anything as an object."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And then that's when you, the mind opens up to the deathless."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And that's adding new stuff on, in terms of what's actually there."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Can you create a more refined perception to move it to a state of lesser stress? So just as Rahula was taught to learn to minimize the harm of his actions, you're minimizing the stress in your concentration by looking at it in terms of actions."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You don't want to cause harm for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And so Ananda got up distressed."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "He says there is this process of eye-making and mind-making."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And then there's the sense of the eye and mind that experiences the pleasure that we want."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It's something that we do."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And that, in that way, it falls under the teaching stuff to Rahula as well."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "There's the eye of the person driving the car."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "That eye and mind is a good one."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "There is this feeling in me, there is this feeling in me, there's this skillful feeling in me, there's an unskillful feeling in me."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "If it's skillful, I want to do what I can to maintain it."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "The third is an extension of the second meaning."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "I don't know if morality is a good word in this community."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It's not the case that morality is just for conventional people, but wisdom is for the people who are above morality."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Question? Where's the other mic? There's a nearby mic."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You say, okay, this is stressful, and it's a very quick kind of internal dialogue, so there is still an element of intention there to drop and move on, drop and move on."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "I can peek in the doorway and see something significant."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "What happens is the mind usually finds that if it drops one fabrication, it goes to a more refined one."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "So you just learn how to drop."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And that fabrication and the existence or non-existence of stress is a correlation."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And I will put a little footnote here as I was reviewing this definition and looking at the translation that Bhikkhu Bodhi used for Sampajanya, which is used in this phrase, which often is translated as clearly, clear comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "This phrase here too, I think, points to some of the wisdom, the perspective of Satipatana that's encouraged."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "This is what it's like to be a human being with this breath arising."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I've been talking about it in another class and it's kind of captured my attention and it's arising again this week."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It comes through attending from these perspectives."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so that's kind of got some juice for me in my own practice right now."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So the phrase says, one abides observing the body as a body internally, or one abides observing the body as a body externally, or both internally and externally."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It's been around looking at the observing other beings."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "The commentaries apparently specifically mention other human beings."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So this is not too challenging to know what that means when we're encouraged to observe the body as a body internally."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "You know, when I started teaching about this a few weeks ago, I, you know, I don't actually get to see a lot of beings right now, except on the computer, you know, I don't get to see beings in, in, in space."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But the other three foundations of mindfulness need to be more inferential, need to be inferential."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It felt very resonant with what I was seeing."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It's like, kind of like there's a resonance that happens with people when I'm listening to them and it's like, I hold it with a grain of salt, but, you know, it's like, oh, this may be, this may be something of what's going on in the other person."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so that may be part of how that works, that empathetic resonance works, so that we can kind of read other people's states through that awareness."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "This is a body, this is another being."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "What's arising externally has an effect, like my description of my own experience, seeing the person standing with their cell phone and the posture and seeing a little bit of that externally, but then seeing what that conditioned for me internally."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so there's this interweaving, a back and forth interplay of conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I think it's about understanding what you didn't understand."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "What did I not understand? Maybe there's something we need to understand about other beings that we don't understand."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so when suffering arises, internally or externally, or both, curiosity, what, what needs to be understood here? That's what the Buddha suggested about suffering."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And I appreciate your engagement in listening and being curious about this."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "If we're attached to them staying a certain way, how do we feel? How are we when they go through their inevitable changes? When they change through accidents, when they change through disease, when they change through the simple process of getting older? It's surprising how different and difficult it is to see that these changes are not a mistake."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It is the very nature of things."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "I came up with one of what I call the vipassana or insight mantras."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Where's that wonderful experience you had a year ago, or that awful experience that happened six months ago, or one month ago, or two weeks ago, or the drive here."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "We live our lives in anticipation of the next hit of experience as if the one that's coming will finally do it for us."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "There is the simple and very powerful reflection that the end of birth is death, that our lives are simply getting shorter and shorter and shorter."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "We dress up corpses and we put makeup on them, and sometimes they look better than they looked in years."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "I'd like to read you something."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "By now there is no way for you to recollect the immense effort that you needed to establish self-pity as a feature of your island."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "As an advisor, self-pity is nothing in comparison to death."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "He remarked to me that there was as much comfort in perfect disease as in perfect health."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "These are not esoteric truths."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And what we see is that it is not hard to be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "So when leaving the hall tonight, when leaving the church, if you can remember between now and then."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "As you leave the hall, pay attention to the flow of changes that are taking place in your experience."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "If we are mindful, if we are paying attention, we can see that all of this experience is like the current of a river, it is like water over or waterfall."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "If you let go a little, you will have a little peace."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "You know, we just get to a place in practice and we pull back from it, we don't want to feel it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "What's interesting, and this we see a lot in meditation, that often it's not the discomfort in the moment that we're pulling back from, but it's the anticipated discomfort of what's going to come."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "About 14 years ago, I had been living at IMS right in the building for many years for about 13 years."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And then when I turned 40, I said, I need to get out of here."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Embarrassment, embarrassment, embarrassment came when I saw it and could accept it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It's very simple, and yet its application is so far reaching."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It's in how we're relating to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "The more we can be with our own difficulty, our own pain, the easier it is to be with the pain and difficulties of others."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Compassion is that feeling that motivates us to do something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "So, when we do mindfulness, we are calling upon or utilizing one of the most amazing capacities of the mind or of the heart, if you prefer."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "And whereas if we attack things, or we are critical of things, or if we try to fix them too quickly, or try to make them go away, or we try to, sometimes we're, you know, even if we're successful sometimes in doing that, sometimes we're not really allowing some deeper inner process to unfold, some deeper healing, some deeper thing that can happen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "You're also not condoning it necessarily by welcoming it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "And my gut feeling was the other person was the challenge."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "But once I kind of saw that I was afraid or saw that I was impatient and could welcome that hold that, then I found myself no longer under the control of those feelings."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "Maybe you could start a process earlier and maybe more directly."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "And you're not going to let the guest forget that it's only the guest."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta Meditation", "completion": "May all be well, may all be at ease, may all be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta Meditation", "completion": "And let it suffuse everything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta Meditation", "completion": "It embraces and accepts whatever unfolds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta Meditation", "completion": "It embraces and accepts whatever unfolds."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "You find this is a Sutundipata verse 705, as I am so are they, as they are so am I, comparing himself with others he should not kill or cause to kill."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But I think also as human cultures evolve and people begin to explore and develop their religious and moral and social thinking and become more self-aware, and we are social empathetic creatures, then I think these sorts of ideas are likely to pop up in different contexts anyway."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But in any case you can point to how both in Buddhism, in Christianity, even in Judaism you can have a foundational precept for doing good as it were, based on an understanding of the world that has no need to appeal to the moral authority of God."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "We are going to break in about half an hour for lunch, but before we do that I would just like to consider some of the texts that I will then develop on this afternoon and read you out some passages."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But if you look at this text, and I am going to read it out to you before we break, I think it is very unlikely that the Buddha delivered this discourse and it was recorded verbatim."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "In English it can be printed on one page."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "It is an extraordinary document, I feel."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "He would follow it and see an ancient city that had been inhabited by people in the past with parks, groves, ponds and ramparts, a delightful place."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "In fact, the path was rather secondary."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "The noble eightfold path that leads to the end of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But here, the path does not lead to the ending of dukkha, at least not explicitly, but it leads to the four noble truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And what happened in India at this time were two things."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "So three phases in each truth, four truths, three times four equals twelve."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "That dependent origination doesn't just refer to the twelve links, which you're perhaps familiar with, but it refers to a kind of underlying principle."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "When this is not, that does not arise."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And I would claim that the first sermon is basically a sequence of conditions and of causes and effects."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "The path is the cause, that leads to the four noble truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But I'm going to tease that out in far more detail, I hope, this afternoon."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But let us conclude just with a reading of the text itself."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "He was staying at Baranasi in the deer park at Isipatana."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "He addressed the group of five."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "One gone forth does not pursue two dead ends, which to infatuation, which is vulgar, uncivilized and meaningless, and mortification, which is painful, uncivilized and meaningless."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "I have awoken to a middle path that does not lead to dead ends."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "It has eight branches, appropriate seeing, thinking, talking, acting, working, trying, recollecting or being mindful, and concentration."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "This is cessation, the traceless fading away and cessation of that craving."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But the Buddha also uses this word anta in the compound antaka, which is a synonym for Mara."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And there are two of these dead ends."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So this cultivation of a stability of mind, this stabilizing mindfulness, moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And that also is an illusion."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "It's just deeply misunderstood in terms of what it is."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "There will be often in that kind of moment-to-moment concentration, experience changes moment-to-moment."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Now you're attending to a particular body sensation, and then a sound, and then an emotion, and then another body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And there was a kind of a shift from the changing experience in the body to a kind of like a concept of the breath."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And the only thing that it's not moment to moment experience that we're absorbing into there, it's a concept, because it's the concept, the mind can hold onto a concept for some stretch of time."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And that absorption into that concept creates not only stillness of awareness or stability of awareness, but stability of object."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Of the two ends of the spectrum, the moment to moment concentration, you're naturally seeing change."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "As the moment-to-moment concentration stabilizes, we may be, there can be a little bit of a shift from kind of curiosity about the kind of the sensations themselves or the emotions themselves or the thoughts themselves, kind of what is often called the specific characteristics of experience, the kind of the quality of pressure or the experience of an emotion in the body or something kind of attuned to the specific quality of the experience."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We also see through the attunement to change that experience is unreliable."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Unreliability is directly related to the impermanent nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So the impermanence, the attuning to change opens the doorway to understanding all of these insights which the Buddha pointed to his own experience of the liberation of that."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We begin to experience a different kind of happiness, a different kind of happiness that is not resisting the change."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "In the one-pointed concentration, the way that connects to wisdom, it's got a little different flavor."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And along comes a condition from the past history, and it just takes us right off the breath."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So we learn a lot as we try to develop this concentration."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We learn a lot in this process of shaping the concentrated mind about what conditions, what wholesome conditions will support this kind of stabilized mindfulness, this stabilized attention."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Because in that absorption, we are not actively doing anything."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "It's the construction of that state and we're just kind of living, resting in that state."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Just how, at the deepest level, sometimes it takes a very, very quiet mind."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "There's no room for a stable anything."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So I must not have seen it right."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "There's also smaller ways that that wisdom arises for us and that recognizing that wisdom is a support for the cultivation of wisdom because wisdom is a wholesome quality of mind that can be cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So it's like, we haven't really seen it shift from one to another, but we know, yeah, there was this and then it's kind of like, we've seen the middle of this object and then suddenly we're in the middle of this object."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And again, it gets back to the point."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So does that speak to your question? Well, one question I have is that is it possible to have come to a one-pointedness through changing objects? I've certainly experienced that it does happen."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "But that's just, you know, some minds might work that way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "It is visible here and now, immediate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "And it's not telling us, come learn, come read these books."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "Come memorize these teachings."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "But as he went down the table, he came to the last person, a teacher, Meizumi Roshi, and when the student left the water for the teacher, the teacher turned around as if that person bringing the water was the most important person at that moment, and bowed, kind of an appreciation and thanks."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "I said, why would you bow to a teacup? So everything is important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "So what's inviting us to see is the world."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "Learn about the richness and the value of this present momentability to be present and to see."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "I remember the first time I had this experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "And maybe that responding to that call can be entering into a deeper life, fuller life."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And so the cultivating this perception of impermanence is something that we can do in our meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And so the relationship that we have to experience is revealed to us in our meditation practice, and we can see that moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And yet what I'm really interested in exploring right now isn't so much in the meditative side of experience, but more the possibility of deep understanding that can be supported by exploring impermanence at the ordinary level, reflecting on impermanence at the ordinary level, at the daily level."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "So we are, I think, in a position right now to really take in the truth of impermanence in a different way than we habitually do."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "We may experience anger, frustration, or confusion, or fear, or longing, or grief, so many different kinds of relationships to this instability, that another piece of the relationship to impermanence, or the believing somehow it should be stable, is that we think it must be somebody's fault if it's not stable."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And that choice may lead to getting in an accident."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "He said, we should reflect frequently."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And he's encouraging us to actually bring these thoughts into our mind."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "All that I have, beloved and pleasing, will become otherwise, will become separated from me."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And it's conditioned also."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "That's the place to see, oh, okay, yeah, if I'm struggling to breathe, if it feels like I'm drowning, can the mind acknowledge and know, yes, this may be the way this being dies? Sometimes I found in this reflection, so right now I'm just kind of taking you through my own process around one reflection."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "That is somehow very settling for me that this is a process that humans have experienced."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "So for me, that sense of fear around going down and knowing that I'm going to hit the ground, that whole process in the mind around the reactivity there, when I remember this has happened to beings before, I don't know exactly why, but it is comforting."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "As the Buddha talked about, he said, eons of world expansion and world contractions, that this is the nature of the universe, of the processes that go in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "That supports the mind to move in the direction of letting go of that fear, not on our timeframe, not by our saying, yes, I go away in fear, I can just choose to make you go away, but more in the way of learning that as we learn what the experience of fear is, our system begins to kind of reorient, respond differently to that experience and learns to let go of it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We observe the body as a body, feelings as feelings, mind states as mind states, dhammas as dhammas, or experience as experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "In the teaching on the mindfulness of the body, there's several, I think there's nine exercises of how to observe the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It talks about observing the breath."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I'm not going to try to talk about the whole of this refrain today, but one piece of it I do want to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "That section marker, the section markers in the various suttas were added several hundred years after the time of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And that seems to be a lot of what the teachings encourage in Satipatana Sutta, and yet he throws in this external piece too."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We've got quite a bit of experience, I think that a lot of the teachings that we do in the West, particularly I think that we that we have emphasized have explored this internal aspect of knowing what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And it seems pretty clear how supportive it is for insight and understanding."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so we see that the conditioned nature of our experience that we don't perhaps have, we feel like we should have more capacity to control how our conditions unfold than we do."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We think other people should have more capacity to be able to prevent themselves from saying mean things."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So in observing others, having had the foundation of seeing how our own system works and how hard it is to navigate our own conditioning, then observing others, we begin to have that same understanding, oh, yeah, they are living their conditioning as well."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I stood up in the meditation hall and I turned around with my eyes open and I was just turning and I saw somebody in their sitting posture sitting very dignified and very slowly moving their hands to change their posture."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But watch while you're doing it, is it causing harm? And so, you know, that's where we observe, how do our actions affect others? And I think what this does, and then also after the fact, because it may be that the consequences of something that we do or say doesn't arise until much later."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So witnessing, watching while we're acting, how is it, how is it landing? How are other people, what's the body language as people are in our environment and witnessing us do these things? What's the expression on their face? What do they say? Sometimes it's really clear."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "Sometimes it's not at all subtle, but they don't like what we've done and there's something that we've done to hurt them."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "This is a way we can learn."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We can learn about others and we can learn about ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And I reflected on this topic after I went to the grocery store, and I had not remembered to do this kind of external contemplation at the grocery store but I'm hoping to remember the next time you know I want to put like a sign on my door because it seemed really exciting to me."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And the, you know, so the, the precepts talked just about false speech, but the Eightfold Path talks about not engaging in divisive speech, or harsh speech, or idle chatter, the idle chatter."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "You know, the Buddha encouraged us to, to look at that too."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We're not doing that intentionally."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But sometimes our actions are motivated by very old delusive patterns that create division or create harm."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so it's an opportunity to learn them."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "For the remaining few minutes of the sitting, seeing if you can be completely with the body and the breath."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "So today we'll be practicing with the first of the factors of enlightenment and that's mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "And so that we can welcome ourselves back."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "Let go of how the sitting has been so far, beginning again."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "So those are some useful things to remember."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "You're bringing more energy in."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "And today, you know, so I have the simplest way, they're kind of very, kind of simplistic, maybe a way of understanding these five qualities is that they are, it's about here, Dharma is here, the Dharma is now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "The Dharma is flowing along and the Dharma is to be experienced."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "So, today the topic, you know, in a simplistic way is the Dharma is looking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "The literal Pali word, as I said last week, is a very common, ordinary expression that suggests this kind of simplicity that I'm talking about a simplistic way of saying it is because it literally means come, look, come see."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "And one of the challenges for some people will be that this simplicity of here and now and simplicity of mindfulness here is boring, that it's unpromising."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "It's not going to provide us with the rich things, the special things, the wonderful things."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "But maybe that's the price of coming into a wonderful state of being, is a willingness to be very simple without expectation, without wanting anything, so that we can put down the activity of boredom, put down the activity of selfing and wanting something and building self up."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "It just becomes simpler and simpler awareness, simpler and simpler looking, the simplicity of it becomes the guide."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "So that's why sometimes it's powerful to realize that, or to have this attitude or understanding that what we're looking for is in the looking."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "One is just the general sensation level in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "This communication between body and mind, this permeable kind of flow our body receives experience and lets our mind know about it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You could say the kind of language of the body, the language of how the body communicates with the awareness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And then a little closer in perhaps, a little more focused might be attending to the experience of breathing in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Just aware this breath as it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And for some of you, it may naturally gravitate towards awareness of the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "To be present with the body."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Come back and do some more talking and some more questions."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So Dukka is the key term in this, but this is the three characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "We don't live as if things are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So as you can see, this is a great setup for our next term, which is dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I said I said right at the beginning of just introducing this topic, it doesn't take a great brain, and all of us will probably nod our assent in some way or another when I say everything is impermanent, and the Buddha says everything is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "That things suddenly somehow don't go our way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "He says there's nothing worse than not getting what we want than getting what we want."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And certainly even the pleasure that is attained when you acquire something, piece of knowledge, some material possession or that doesn't last."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Pain is something that we will not get rid of."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And this is what the Buddha is saying."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "To respond is still to be in the heart and the midst of life."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It links up with the first of the characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Again, I think the words are deceptively simple."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "The Buddha who stands out to me from the teachings outside of the philosophies of the Theravada or Mahayana or any of these other schools that have developed, the Buddha that stands out to me or comes out of those pages of the text as we have them now, is a figure of eminently practical concerns."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It is the love of wisdom, philosophy."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I often mention this because I think it's such an important thing that I think particularly as Westerners who approach the teaching, we often come at it with what I call the myth of authenticity, that we have to have the authentic mental feeling in order to be able to do the right stuff."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So we're directing our mind in a particular way, inclining our mind in a particular way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "We couldn't possibly do that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "That's why, in a sense, I think the English word practicing is very good."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "When I was living in Sri Lanka, one of the places I used to stay, I had a meditation teacher, unfortunately he's dead now, but when he was used to calling people for interview after being there for about a month and really settled in and he would say to them things like, are you feeling settled? And they would go, yes, yes, yes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "The world is the world of our minds, through which all of that experience of the outside is filtered."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "We get a world which is saturated with that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Yeah, let's face it, you're always in a mood."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "How are you going to do it? How are you going to live? In fact, here's another question I remember giving a talk in Cambridge Meditation Centre last year."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "How do you want to live your life? Do you want to live it being constantly off balance, out of balance, thrown out by this fluctuating, evanescent, changing world, or do you want to live it almost like a ballet dancer with poise and balance in this world? There is a word that's used in the Abhidharma tradition, which again is part of the early tradition here, which is a synonym for upeka."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And out of a joyfulness, often something that often gets forgotten about in Buddhist circles."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And almost with a sort of, I don't know, almost reversal of Western culture."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "First of all, the start of any inquiry is to receive it, isn't it? Just like you're listening to me today."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's in our world more often than not reading something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "But there's got to be that initial impetus, the input."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "This is what sadha is about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Which is bhavana, my panya."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "The wisdom that's going on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So this is what's also going on in these early texts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "In these early traditions, it's simply the unchanging essence of the universe."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "But there you get, if you really want to know what's going on in terms of the self, you get 52 mental factors and 121 forms of consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "These appear to be linear, the way they're set up in teaching."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And if you don't get that, it seems a very reductionistic, almost derogatory process."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Would it be nice if they were, but they're not."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So actually our emotions are off, well, aspects of forming our experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Because you're actually opening up experience again to re-perceive and actually igniting something that's been lost often, if you're really engaged in this process, igniting curiosity, igniting interest in what's actually happening."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So this is going around in a circle, just as the whole sense of what we're perceiving is going around in a circle."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Now, if I want to leave you with an image, it's not a very attractive image here, but if I want to leave you with an image, it's not as bad as the incontinent one, don't worry."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "None of this is basically coherent with the early texts."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "He who has no mindfulness of the body of Rupa has no mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Now, vinyana, as you heard me just lightly touch on the Abhidharma, vinyana or chitta, often these two words are used synonymously."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And vinyana is connected with the processes, the thinking processes of discriminating and what the narrative structures or the habits or the formations that come into play in any consciousness of something."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "If it's, in a sense, a dead zone, which is what I was talking about in relationship to the neither, neither pleasant or unpleasant, then in a way it connects with confusion or delusion because I'm not even noticing it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And the other question is on Jhana, and this is on the Visuddhimagra version of Jhana, which involves basically getting to a place where you have no bodily awareness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Sounds like that's not something you're in favour of, so if you could address these queries."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "That's the great temptation of Mara."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So, Mara is often associated with these three functions, greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "That's really, I think, what's going on in that passage there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "There's a very good book I could point people to."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Is there something about the holding on to power within monastic contexts if you keep on upping the bar to have these extraordinary, extraordinary experiences that actually don't seem to me to hold that much value in terms of a liberative process and saying that you must attain these before you can even enter into doing vipassana."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Yet I find this phrase so powerful that he who does not have mindfulness of the body does not have mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I mean, I really just do not."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "We have a mindfulness in schools project."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's the basic teachings of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's translated by Glenn Wallace and it's got a commentary by him as well on the sutras that he's translating too."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's in Romanized script which also makes it easy in Pali but it does have all the apparatus of the classical language within it which isn't always easy for some people."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And so this phrase is the description what the Buddha says is important about establishing wise mindfulness, how we establish mindfulness that is supportive for freedom."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "I sometimes give a whole talk on this phrase and unpack each of those words and in here we're just basically going to take one word of that phrase and unpack it over the course of many days."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So I did want to just put it in the context of this phrase, though the term clear comprehension in the context of this phrase."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "The establishment of mindfulness we can say is really, it's kind of the aim of our practice of what we're doing here."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So in that, in that definition, it even connected it with this aspect of memory."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And there's a number of places that this term, clear comprehension, is used in the suttas where it doesn't really define the term in those places either, but it kind of gives us a little flavor of what the function it serves."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And in fact in the prior exercise on the postures, that's exactly the way it's put, only it doesn't use the term Sampajanya, it uses the term Pajanati."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "This part of the teaching seems to extend it to more activities and seems to intensify the knowing a little bit."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "Know that you're talking while you're talking."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So there's a famous sutta of the Buddha talking to his son and saying, Very little is the recluse of one who is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "There's another place where it mentions the same thing, it says, somebody being questioned asking if they know, saying I do not know or not seeing says I see, says this in full awareness speaking falsehood for their own ends or another's ends or for some trifling worldly end."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "It's like it just takes root and sometimes you use the analogy of a scooter with the establishment of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And then at some point, you'll start to get a sense of the wobbliness of that scooter and realize, oh, time to put my foot down again."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And so the understanding or the awareness of the wholesome and the unwholesome here is brought into this."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And it can also be understood as the insight that comes with the establishment of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "Only aware of what's here, that's clearly comprehending aspect of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So we don't necessarily have to try to see experience as impermanent, to try to watch something arise, persist, and pass away, and yet the kind of the curiosity of what is this experience as experience can begin to reveal that to us, and so this, I see this definition almost from two perspectives, one as a kind of a pointer to an aspect of experience that's useful to attune to, the impermanent nature of experience, and the other as this is how, when mindfulness becomes established, how one sees experience."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "One understands feelings, thoughts, and perceptions as they arise, persist, and pass away when going forward and returning."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "One understands feelings as they arise, persist, and pass away while looking ahead and looking away."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "I think this is spoken to by that last piece of fully aware, what exercises clear comprehension, being fully aware of feelings, thoughts, perceptions as they arise, persist and pass away."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "At the beginning we do need to cultivate some deliberateness of that attention and bring everything into the field by being clearly aware this is what is arising."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "Understanding is what ultimately frees the mind, lets the mind let go."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "There's kind of a lawfulness around what happens."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "What we tend to have done in the past tends to be what unfolds and what happens."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "You know, have how many, I mean, we all have experienced when we are in a conversation and somebody expresses something with anger, it's like it tends to evoke it in us as well."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So it tends to be, you know, anger tends to shape anger, tends to shape it internally, and it tends to shape it externally."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So we start to see how these volitional formations, these mental formations have an effect on us."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "When we actually start to look with mindfulness, we see the conditioned nature of these mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "What each of our mind states, what its basic function is, what does it do? What does love tend to do? Love tends to connect us to create conditions of care and concern."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "It's like it doesn't take a me in there to do that separation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So in the sutra it describes each of the five aggregates in this way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Just tonight in the time that we have, in a pretty short time we have right now, I'm going to just talk a little bit about the way the Buddha described the mental formations aggregate."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So I will read this section."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Why do you call them fabrications? Because they fabricate fabricated things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "They fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "In psychology, there's this, this kind of understanding that when we look out into the world, we tend to pull out information that confirms what we already believe."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "They, what is received by sight, by sound, by smell, by taste, by touch seems to be shaped by the state of our mind."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "He didn't use that word, but he used the analogy of a stone sinking to the bottom of the, of a pond."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Primarily aware of this beingness that is now it's empty of any identities."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "If life said to you, to your life, who are you? You might say, I'm like you on life."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Maybe it is consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Maybe you can feel your compassionate intention to be free, to be liberated from the painful illusions that we mistake for what is me."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "When we see the goodness of others, we allow them to flower within."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "But when we say what is your own goodness, what is your own, what do you see about your own goodness? We're a little shy."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "And you might spend your entire time on that."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Well, I think it's kind of interesting that maybe you've had this experience."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "The Buddha talks all about suffering on the first step."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Like I'm doing for this party."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "And it just needs to be accepted and seeing."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "The intention to feel back layers and reach the heart."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Here, um, With what I want to talk about, uh, With you all for the next few minutes or so."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "And I, as I reflected on this, I was noticing that, you know, As people age, as we age, we naturally, We begin to experience really a dizzying array of physical and mental changes And transitions that totally run the gamut from everything from loss, Heartbreak, grief, sadness, or disappointment, Disappointment in others, disappointment in ourselves, Sometimes disappointment in life itself."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "So our lives are so full of experiences that trigger and challenge us And throw us off balance."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "May the merit of our good hearts open and the wisdom of our insight open proliferate throughout this world To help with all the suffering in the world, to help calm all the suffering in the world, to help the, as Robert said, to all the suffering in Ukraine, to help all the problems of horrible racial discrimination, all of the suffering that's caused To really penetrate the universal problem of this insane monkey mind that grasps and causes so much suffering."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And they have a big, big archive of talks."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And just like with anger and other kind of emotions, that it's best not to take them as being unnecessary or unfortunate, but take them as something that deserves our respect."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And in that state, our relationship to fear can be very different than if we're agitated and feeling vulnerable and not stable, and kind of, you know, feeling quite easily like we're about to collapse."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So there's a fairy tale that I think works well for this kind of mindfulness approach."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So this was a little bit disturbing for the princess."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And she's down and taken off the tenth one."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "When you've taken off your tenth dress, embrace the monster."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And so, but the wise woman said then, embrace the monster."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I thought that they would tell me to go away and wouldn't have anything to do with me."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And as I went below that, I saw that I felt quite tender and vulnerable without any interpretation of what that was."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And so as I went down through the layers, I came to a place where it actually was quite good."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So if you're going from the surface mind down, there might be so much ego, so much self-identity issues operating that we might think that I'm not supposed to be a afraid person."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And then as we come from that perspective and come up and address the fear, then it gets much simpler."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I'm afraid therefore I'll always be afraid."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "You're less likely to see how the fear is a messenger for something maybe more important."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And sometimes being with the fear, offering the fear safety, and we're exposing ourselves to what's going on, and rather than recoiling or getting agitated or being by it, it's kind of like exposing ourselves to it."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So I'm not saying go look for fear."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So how often are we the painter? How often are we kind of telling ourselves a story and spinning a tail in our minds and that what frightens us is not a real life event but rather the story we make up."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And you're going to feel it in your belly, you feel your whole physiology changes, your breathing changes and butterflies in the stomach and tension arises, contraction happens, and you're reminding your own business."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And this is the gift of fearlessness."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And I took this English class."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And I don't have any memory."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And then I'll tell you another story that maybe is hopefully encouraging for you."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I'm not really afraid of public speaking anymore."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Some of you will discover that fear is a much more pervasive emotion in your life than you realized."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Because if you have pervasive fear, apprehension that underlies your life, how you think, how you act, how you're in the world, it's much better to know it that that's the case than not know it."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "If we talk like this, maybe there's some burning question or concern or something you're afraid of that you want to bring up."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Well, this is not something that I am afraid of, but I was sitting, we were giving a talk, another girl and myself, and she was actually giving the talk."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "It's a great possibility the United States will stop funding that war."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "But I think that if you can make yourself safe, so the person."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And so there can be some very specific sensations that come into a broader awareness."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "Body sensation might might be felt this way."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "We can sometimes touch into a sense of a vibratory energy throughout the body or a sense of an emotional tone that's felt in the body."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And so I speak to it in those kind of situations."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "There's something shifty, uncomfortable, something vague, something that I can't articulate."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And allowing it to kind of reveal itself and using all of our skills of allowing, of friendly attention, allowing attention to just let it be, let it be what it is."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "So recently, a few days ago, I was exploring something and, you know, there was a dynamic with some people and I sat down with the niggly feeling and came to this uncomfortable kind of diffuse feeling."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "Just like, oh, well, this is the situation."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "Now, I imagine there can be times in this kind of exploration that there might be a sense of, oh, yeah, and something does need to happen."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And in a way, what we explored in the guided meditation, the context or the content of the experience we explored in that was, how are you in this moment? And so I'm curious, if anybody is willing to talk about, speak to what you noticed in that, in that guided meditation, was there a sense of being able to touch, even fleetingly being able to touch into a broader sense, a broader felt sense of experience."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "So I would, so as not to say anything negative, I would turn my mic off."}

{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "Aryarathna the founder of Sarvodaya organization except I simplify it a little bit, so we have at the bottom of the pyramid the basic material needs that have to be met everybody should have sufficient nutritious food, clean potable water, should have satisfactory sanitation, should have spacious, decent, clean living quarters shelter, should have decent clothing that have access to affordable medical care so at the bottom of the pyramid extremely essential for a wholesome and fulfilling life meeting the material needs, at the second level we have meeting what we can call the developmental needs this would mean living in a harmonious family where there are healthy family relationships between husband and wife, parents and children, children to parents and the children to one another, and so one needs the kind of values that will enable a wholesome family life to develop we find the Buddha has given important guidelines in this area in his teaching of the Sigalovada Sutta, it's actually one of my favorite suttas because it's not dealing with these super high meditative states or these super profound philosophical insights into selflessness, dependent origination, emptiness whatever, but in fact this is really what clinched my faith in the Buddha, when I read the Sigalovada Sutta he explains how children should treat their parents how parents should treat the children, how the husband should treat the wife how the wife should treat the husband, how a teacher treats his students, the students treat the teacher, how the worker relates to his employer, how the employer should treat the workers and when I read this I thought wow somebody can be completely enlightened and yet can advise the husband once in a while give a nice gift to your wife and when you have workers in your home make sure that they get enough nutritious food and give them every year, give them an annual vacation when I was reading the teachings on patichasamupada, selflessness I thought wow the Buddha can really be enlightened maybe, but maybe not that's just his view against the view of the Advaita Vedantans who say everything is all the one universal reality but then when I read some of the Advaita Vedantans say that if a Shudra person from the lowest class in Indian society hears the Vedas, the sacred texts he should be beaten but the Buddha says the husband should give the wife authority in the home and the employer should give vacation to his workers and the friend should look after his friend in times of need and provide any assistance that's necessary then I thought wow the difference between these Brahminical Vedantic teachings and the Buddha just so startling clear that truly the Buddha is the enlightened one and then there's a story about Sunita it comes in the Teragata, the verses of the elder monks, Sunita was in Indian society he was like an outcast his job was to go in the early morning through the streets where people would put out just I guess the Indian toilet system of the days when people would be finished going to the toilet they would put the excrement out in a certain place on the street and the outcast person that nobody wants to touch or deal with would sweep up the excrement into a kind of barrel and collect it and then dispose of it someplace outside the town so that was Sunita's job was just to collect the excrement, an excrement collector and one day he was at his work and the Buddha comes walking down the street together with a couple of the monks and Sunita feels so ashamed and so afraid that he thinks that's the ascetic Gautama, the famous teacher that they call the Buddha coming and here he's just wearing this loincloth, his body all dirty and smelly and he puts aside his instruments and he goes standing against the wall, he just doesn't want to get in the way of the Buddha, he thinks the Buddha is such a powerful ascetic radiating his majestic presence and he feels so low, miserable and dirty and the Buddha comes walking past him and turns to him and says, Sunita would you like to go forth and become a monk under me? Sunita says, I can't do that I'm, excuse me, I'm a shit collector the Buddha says, if you want to become a monk you're welcome and Sunita felt just like somebody who was eating a poor person just eating a few grains of rice, he'd suddenly come and put a sumptuous meal on his plate so he thought wonderful Pante, please ordain me as a monk and so the Buddha arranged for his ordination then after becoming ordained as a monk and getting his basic instruction Sunita went off to practice meditation and after a period of diligent practice he became an arahant enlightened one, perfectly liberated one then one night he was sitting out on the rock you know, it was kind of flat rock sitting in meditation and then Saka, Saka is the king of the devas, the gods in the heaven of the 33 comes down and worships Sunita, the people see just the bright light then Mahabrahma surrounded by many of his Brahma deities come down from even a higher heaven and worship Sunita, so the whole hill on which Sunita is sitting is now enveloped by a bright light and then the Buddha recites this verse in which he praises Sunita, the outcasts the excrement collector, this one he says that is the true Brahman the true one of the highest class, the one who has destroyed all of the defilements and become illumined, enlightened, liberated in mind okay so this shows what I would call at least at one level this commitment to this potential that is in all living beings especially all human beings for awakening, for enlightenment and based on that we have the conception of social justice that we all have this entitlement to unfold these potentials and to unfold them we need material security, we need the wholesome family life, we need the wholesome social structure we need the freedom to develop our intellectual potential and the freedom to develop our spiritual potential okay the fourth quality that enters into this constellation of qualities that enable us to practice conscientious compassion is wisdom and here by wisdom I'm speaking at a practical level, I'm not talking about the insight into the dependent origination or into the three characteristics of all phenomena but wisdom in the sense of we might call this judiciousness, the ability to choose right goals goals that are in accordance with the Dharma and goals that are realistic goals that we might be able to fulfill so we have to explore different avenues, different possibilities to engage in compassionate action and choose some goal that seems to us right and proper and a goal that accords with our own temperament, with our own talents with our own abilities and then we commit ourselves based on that perception of what is the appropriate goal and then having chosen the right goal one also has to choose with wisdom the right means to fulfill that goal just to give a rather simple practical example to say with our work in Buddhist global relief when we decide that we would like to provide food assistance to say people in say Niger or Mali who are suffering from malnutrition we have to choose the right organization to work with, the right partner and then this will be a partner like we chose the Helen Keller International Organization so that is choosing with wisdom the right goal, we investigate the organization, see what they're doing, how they operate, how they use their funds and then from other records we find that they're reliable then we ask them to submit the proposal they submit the proposal and then we examine the proposal and evaluate it and this is using a kind of wisdom, it doesn't have to be people hear the word wisdom in a Buddhist context they think that's the wisdom of enlightenment but this is a kind of very practical wisdom the next quality or practice that we have to undertake in engaging in this work and that is what I call self-cultivation and this goes in a way this extends out from wisdom and this goes with the aspect mentioned in the discussion this morning in order to work effectively for others one has to also take care of oneself the one thing that we all want to avoid is we call burnout over extending our self to the point we suffer sometimes as an expression compassion fatigue where you engage in too much compassionate activity, activity that goes beyond one's own strength, beyond one's own inner ability and then one burns out and sometimes becomes angry sometimes becomes depressed, sometimes becomes overwhelmed by a sense of futility so when we come into this work what we want to bring into it is a strong, flexible malleable mind a mind which is able to face difficulties without collapsing under their weight a mind which is flexible enough to adapt to different situations that we encounter and a mind which is gentle enough to be able to know when to stop back, to step back and wait patiently so self-cultivation actually involves a whole nexus of qualities including both energy, patience and bhavana or meditation and it's especially the meditative practice that untaps from within our self hidden reserves of strength that we didn't know existed so when we practice the meditation it's somewhat like maybe it's like digging to open up a well, not an oil well if you want to keep those well covered, but a well from which water can spring up, nourishing sweet, delicious water and so as we calm the mind make the mind quiet, we're able to make the mind steady, poised, strong and equanimous and then we can bring that strong mind into the field of compassionate action so that we can act effectively, act with the wisdom of judiciousness and making the right choices, choosing the right principles and policies to follow in order to achieve our aim a sixth quality that is essential or important in the work of conscientious compassion is respect for others because the work of compassion in the world first is usually undertaken as a group activity a community activity and so when we work with others we always have to develop the frame of mind which inwardly is humble and without any self promotion responsibility can respect others in that we allow others to speak we are ready to listen to the viewpoint of others we're ready to give others responsibilities rather than think that I am the great worker so I should take all of the responsibilities for myself and then often there are differences of opinions differences of views so we have to be able to negotiate these differences successfully, skillfully and if we have even a subtle kind of arrogant attitude or an attitude of a slight degree of haughtiness or of self-righteousness the Buddha speaks about one of the negative qualities he calls it's called clinging to one's own view and relinquishing with difficulty he says like this is one of the factors that can lead to speaking to the sangha to disputes quarrels and dissension within the sangha and so in any kind of communal activity people come together often people with sometimes with strong opinions of course one has to have the conviction to present one's views and opinions but one shouldn't have this clinging to them out of respect for one's colleagues one should be willing to listen to other opinions and then with impartial wisdom one ways the different opinions the different suggestions and then decides what is best not what I originally proposed I should mention that when I first became involved with Buddhism my teacher was a Vietnamese monk who was studying in the same university that I was studying in and I come from a New York Jewish background and there's one thing New York Jewish boys are all taught by their mothers don't let anybody argue you down you know just as much as they do and you argue your point of view and so when I started to study Buddhism you know I had been reading Buddhist books for a few months and my teacher at that time had been a monk for 13 years or so and had passed through like a monastic college in Vietnam but when he would express an opinion that was somewhat contradictory to what I was reading in the books of Alan Watts in those days you know I would start arguing with him and when I saw I couldn't convince him I would turn around and leave the room in which we were speaking and sometimes slam the door behind me until he would call me back and he would tell me when you have an opinion don't cling to it as being necessarily right but you should listen to the other person's opinion and always think in your mind I might be right I might be wrong but what's important is not to defend my position but to find out what is true and correct and then he taught me that I should say that sentence to myself every morning after waking up and I did that for quite some time and I don't think I've overcome that problem without 50 or 60% still working on it okay so have respect for the people with whom one works and when one is working with others always have respect for the people for whom one is working this is really I think one of the key contributions that Buddhism can make in this field of interfaith collaboration because people I have to say from the west the western religions come to the Asian countries to African countries somewhat with the idea that we the westerners from the Christian background or the Jewish background we're the ones who know best we will tell you how to do things first we always have to have this attitude of looking at others whether they're simple, poor, illiterate, doesn't matter look at them as human beings whose minds actually embrace the whole universe everyone is just an embodiment you could say a manifestation of the whole universe and so when considers people from that point of view they're one even the simple children okay so the sixth is respect for others so now just to recapitulate I've had faith compassion a sense of justice wisdom or judiciousness self cultivation or meditative cultivation and respect for others and there's a seventh factor that I'm going to mention and this might seem a little bit odd in a Buddhist context but I call this openness to grace and this means that the way I understand it when one makes a commitment to following a spiritually grounded altruistic life and really surrenders to a greater force as Buddhist we can call this the power of the triple gem then somehow it sets in motion these invisible waves that roll out from our own minds and hearts a kind of spiritual or psychic energy that sends its vibrations out through the whole universe and starts connecting with other people's minds and hearts in ways we can't understand and brings about sometimes astonishing unpredictable surprising mind blowing events that seem like utter unforeseeable coincidences but this is happening because one sets up that resolution the wholesome intention and intention which I would say that speaking a little mystically it sort of vibrates in harmony with the vibrations of the cosmic Dharma the cosmic law of the universe and that law is all pervading and all embracing so many currents start getting activated that will bring you sometimes into contact with exactly the person that you need to help you exactly the person to teach you exactly the person to study from you with you sometimes exactly the person to provoke you to antagonize you to obstruct you in order to give you the opportunity to advance further and so when we undertake this work of compassionate activity we focus our mind dedicate it to the good and act with trust in the invincible power of goodness and then we in a sense dance with any conditions that arise in the conviction that by as long as we are committed to the good we will eventually prevail and we see this as the working of grace or in the Pali we might call this the Buddha Anubhava, Buddha Anubhava, Dharma Anubhava Sangha Anubhava the spiritual power of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha which is helping us to advance in fulfilling this ideal of wise and compassionate activity."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "And the important point here that everyone emphasizes, the mind is no longer caught or preoccupied with thoughts, with feelings, emotions, with reactivity, with the world."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "Now the mind becomes much more infused with this wider kind of awareness, this presence, this attentiveness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "It would be a little bit like someone wants to go swimming in a wonderful pool of water, but they're, you know, maybe they're on their cell phone talking some animated, engaging, upsetting conversation that completely absorbed in the conversation."}

So we have to learn these lessons in our own time."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And we find, ah, here's the ground."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And so how do we find our way in this world of navigating in all of this? When do we emphasize peace, appreciate it, value it, cultivate it?

{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And so I thought just taking this word today and just reflecting on some different ways in which we can think about it and apply it, apply the sense of what clear comprehension is to our situation."}

{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "It's like whatever situation is happening, this shift in our minds around ignorance and craving, the release from ignorance and craving, will create the conditions for ease and peace."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "Now, it doesn't say while sleeping, and yet, you know, that's an interesting topic for another time, perhaps the possibility that this kind of mindfulness can enter into sleep."}

{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And the teaching of wise mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta, that word, Satipatana, often translated as foundation of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "One place is an interesting usage of the word."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And so that's a piece of the aspect of what clear comprehension is."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "He says, clear comprehension, one understands feelings, thoughts, and perceptions are understood as they arise, persist, and pass away."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "I think the purpose is kind of looking at the broader picture, the aspiration, the direction."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "Or we can do something with a kind of an attitude of wanting to get as much as I can out of the situation, agreed, or an attitude of wanting to control or manipulate something."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And so that's a piece, first is a piece of what are our aspirations and then the reflection on suitability asks us to look at what's our motivation? How are we in relationship to our activities in our lives? And so, you know, I think we can have the possibility of kind of clarifying or refining not only our broader aspirations, but also those underlying intentions and motivations."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And there's a lot of little steps that we have to do, little things that we have to do to get there, you know, little things like taking care of our bodies, you know, like taking a shower or, you know, having a meal or going grocery shopping."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "The phrase he uses is, how can the practice of mindfulness be done with these very circumstances? This is the clear comprehension of domain."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So I just wanted to open it up to questions."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So I'll just kind of summarize if there's any comments or questions or reflections that you'd like to share on this topic."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "Be honest about those activities that are kind of necessary, and those that are unnecessary."}

{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So, the truth is that none of this is easy to be with or accept, and it goes against the grain of our habits and our normal or our default patterns of behaviors and beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "When we are honest, we see that our world isn't unfolding as we really expected, and this is a bummer for a lot of us."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "This doesn't always happen, but as we begin to practice, we can begin to notice this."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So one way that we cultivate self-acceptance is by developing the courage that it takes to open and sustain an awareness of activities such as self-criticism or harsh self-judgment or how easily we default to judging others and the aversion and ill will that we feel towards others."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "This is an example of how we cultivate self-compassion, real self-compassion."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "It allows us to see what we take to be ourselves for what it really is."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "In this way, we can take responsibility for the causes and conditions that our mind encourages in the present without drowning in the mistakes of the past."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So the proposition that I wanted to make this morning or that I wanted to present was that this quality of self acceptance is something that can be learned."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "These occurrences happen day in and day out for all of us."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "We see ourselves as roles."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "It's a one and done proposition."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "And in the moment when that happens, at least for me and my personal experience, in the moment when that happens, there is a quality of self-acceptance."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So I want to say I hope this hasn't been too cognitive because there's, it's really a very immediate kind of thing that we can notice in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Cindy, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "We can change our relationship to the way that we are with the world."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Yeah, can you hear me okay? I can."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "I'm wondering if that's ever useful or whether those are just telling stories and confusing the situation."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So what I'm going to suggest."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So Charlie, I'm going to say that you've answered your own question and the truth is that there are many practices which we can call upon and use when we're feeling disoriented or overwhelmed or when we want to have a big mind experience and we're feeling contracted and see there are many roads to Rome."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Can you hear me okay, Robert? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "When I'm suffering, you see, what I'm recognizing is the resistance to the actual suffering."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "And it's one of the hardest things to learn."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "So building these bonds of sangha that were mentioned in some of the announcements are an important part of who we come to be after practicing together with each other."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "So I think it's really beneficial for us to recognize each time we encounter another being that we're already connected just by being alive."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But grandmother says, which one will win? And she says, the one you feed."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But if they lead us to suffering or if they lead us to harmful actions, what is the intelligent thing to do? Well, not to go there."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "It allows you to notice sooner because instead of getting hit with a stick, you're going to get a little pat on the back from the one who matters most, this one here."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And it's also helpful when we give our appreciation to others."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "She's a third grade teacher."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And then he went on over to his seat and she said to him, Josh, what was that? And he said, well, Miss Bennett, did you ever notice? Did you ever forget that you were alive and then notice that you were? A third grader, you know."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "So when you notice that you're alive, you can remember it's a gift."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "My work is loving the world and I thought, yes, that's it, right on the nose."}

{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But I wanted to go over and express my gratitude to him and greet him and as I was walking toward him I felt viscerally, physically these waves of loving kindness just emanating from him."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And relinquishing thoughts has been an extremely difficult task for me."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But when we recognize a conditioning that leads to pain, that's the beginning to recognize that thought when I pick it up and I hook it to the next and the next and the next."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But also humor works better for me than blame or criticism or shame or whatever, other kinds of things I might use to stop it."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But acknowledging that I am doing it, I'm not the sort of innocent victim of somebody else's nefarious scheme, this is my thought."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "Be persistent, but kind and gentle, not rough and nasty, but you don't want to do that."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "You know, I did want to mention one other thing, and I'm too late for some of those who left at 10."}

{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "There is something in us that is really is compassionate."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "I don't know if that's at all."}

{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But the function of meditation in Buddhism is not simply to become calm, or peaceful in some kind of conventional way, but is to use the level of calm or peace or well-being that can come from meditation as a springboard for developing greater insight or greater understanding of our life."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And they just sit there and look at it."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So in the same way, developing a strong level of calm or concentration in meditation is not an end in itself, but is a tool that can be used."}

{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So, you know, if I desire a Ferrari, right, that's what I really thirst for, right, nice red convertible Ferrari."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So the desire for the car is not the root, that's the branch."}

{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And, you know, you can easily, you know, manipulate things, you know, at least, and change things around."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But anyway, the mind is software."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But moving the mind, moving the heart to a greater and greater state of great, great possibility of awakening, of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It kind of builds the muscle and builds the insight that allows you eventually to take the big steps of letting go of some of the big things, of some of these deeper roots that we have."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because what it means to me is that, what it points to is that Buddhist practice, in Buddhist practice, that we're as sensitive to our own suffering as a suffering of others."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And being sensitive and open to see the suffering of the world around us is a compassionate act that extends out away from us to the world around us."}

{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "But we need the support of community."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "And so we need actually to see, to begin to look at the ways in which our habits, our patterns are shaping us and the ways in which the usual thoughts about how to be happy, the kind of societal thoughts about how we should be happy, when we begin to look at our minds and see that those ways, those ways of engaging out of greed and aversion, get what I want, get rid of what I don't want, that that is suffering internally."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "And so the Buddha has talked about this path as swimming against the stream, that what we're seeing, how we're engaging, what we see, what we are asked to let go of, what the wisdom that develops as I talked about in the guided meditation, the seeing of the patterns and habits of our hearts and minds as we see that, we feel the suffering of it."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "The conditions, and I talked about conditions earlier, what are the conditions of this situation, these situations?

{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "What is the condition? What's happening? What are the conditions? This moment, the conditions of this moment, just as within our own experience, we can see that what's arising in this moment, whatever's happening internally in this moment, is not just about my response right to this moment, but is connected to the shaping of my life, of my history."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "And so we see it's kind of a vast web of conditioning coming together for this."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "But I think what Trevor Noah was pointing to is that we need to, in this reflection on conditioning, see if we can step outside of our own conditioning and think of what has somebody else's conditioned experience been."}
{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "So this is the condition of, in particular, the United States, this history."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And not straining to know or discover, but just to relax, kind of glancing at it, looking at it, roaming around the thing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And the second foundation, when begins by just becoming aware of the feeling tone of experience, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, as we settle in and become more familiar with it, more sensitive, we're able then to distinguish between those things which are pleasant of the flesh and those which are not of the flesh, that which is in the part of the sensual world of mind and body, and those which are more spiritual in nature."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And so the mind then can get scattered, just jumps around kind of looking for something to be concerned with, but not enough focus to really settle in anything."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "Even with the eyes closed, the mind becomes quite expansive, quite large, because it's its nature to be that way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "The awareness that can include everything and be broad enough is dharmic."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And how to make that transition from desire and aversion to this expanded state, it really helps if we no longer are convinced, or not us, but maybe our mind, convinced that what's important is to pursue desires, what's important is to be involved in aversion, or even what's important is to kind of be constantly preoccupied with our delusions, our thoughts, our confusions about things, all those who can feel how that limits us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "So we'll continue tomorrow on this third foundation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And so if you'd like to donate to this fund, all the money you'll give to IMC for this purpose will go to the Save the Children."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Everything's nice and wonderful, maybe."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Sometimes it's called monkey mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So monkey mind is a mind that thinks one thing and then immediately grabs for the next thought."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And what's very interesting about restlessness is that there are different levels of it or intensities of it and that there can be the most obvious where it's clear that you're restless."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Even the very, even the subtlest movement to want to think about something, you can feel that as a movement away from stability."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "It's like you have a really, really still pond, lake of water."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So sometimes what's needed is to really kind of look and understand, are there causes and reasons for being restless? The other half of this hindrance is worry."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "I noticed that sometimes spending too much time on my computer, too many hours, emails, that I don't think there's any particular attachments that I have to deal with or identity issues as a deal with."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But it's just somehow that activity seems to kind of makes my mind kind of agitated."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So there might be things we need to look at in our lives."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So if in meditation, restlessness and regrets, worries, it's a regular visitor for you, comes a lot."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And now, restlessness can be really fun in meditation sometimes."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "See, where is there calm? Is there a possibility of calm here? And sometimes just evoking and thinking about it, I can just settle my mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But you have a regular routine that you follow."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So the restlessness doesn't have the upper hand."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And feel how it is to be anxious."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And turn the attention 180 degrees and feel what it's subjectively, what it's like to be anxious, what it's like to worry."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And sometimes it morphs into maybe a regret."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And then it might morph into anger."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And then that anger might morph into sadness."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And each of these layers, it's like a layer going deep down, down."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But it's staying very, very much in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "There's lots more I could say, but that would be a distracting now from this one instruction."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Just on its own, from maturity."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "I guess my focus of my question is about actually another state of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "That's an interesting topic."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "There can be, you know, personal psychological issues that go on with all kinds of stuff."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "It's really useful out there in the wild."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So both of them have learned how to, both of these people have learned how to use the mind they have rather than thinking, you know, I can't do it because I have this kind of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And so going for a walk and thinking and think about things, going for a friend and exploring things, talking about some issues with a friend in some useful way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And if you did, I hope you were listening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "Hello and warm greetings for our time together here with the practice of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "As the practice of Satipatana, the practice of mindfulness deepens, there becomes a shift that arises because we develop a reference point that tends to be very different from how life is usually lived."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "To have mind thinking can have stress connected to it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "A mind that doesn't cling to anything, but sees everything."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "Maybe even thinking becomes unnecessary, because there's a state of peacefulness, or ease, or calm, or openness, clarity, non-reactivity."}

{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And to me, that's more descriptive of what's being offered in the Satipattana Sutta is activities that will support the establishment of this quality of mind."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's an amazing part of our human minds, this capacity."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so the Buddha recognizing this ordinary capacity could be used to be curious about what is this experience and that that could be transformative."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "This third foundation is asking us to know, recognize the presence or absence of greed, aversion and delusion in the first half of the third foundation."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "One understands mind affected by greed as mind affected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "If you follow the impulse of aversion, then you'll be okay."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The mind's making a kind of painful bargain."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Kind of a natural kind of orienting movement of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And there are other places where the Buddha does point to strategies for navigating it."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And there's a vast difference between knowing the understanding that greed is present in the mind and being led by greed when greed is present in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so we begin to feel the difference between knowing, understanding greed, aversion, present in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Or, and that could be convincing it to change too, you know, that's another flavor of that."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so our various emotions may kind of have, you know, different aspects of these qualities."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I'll be happy once this is, when I get rid of this thing."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But I in some ways feel like these first three are kind of the encouragement to just get this continuity of being present, going with what's happening in the body and in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So we could, for a period of time, kind of orient through this lens of the third foundation, presence or absence of greed, presence or absence of aversion."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And next week, I'll talk about delusion."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's a powerful force in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And that can happen through an understanding of how delusion works first by hearing a little bit about how delusion works."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I'm the only reason you're going to do something."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So, in your, you made a comment about how noticing the presence or absence of greed, for example, could be a practice in itself."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "When we notice it, so if you notice the mudita and you notice the clinging to it, you'll notice the pain of the clinging to it."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so it's kind of self correcting, but there are times when we cling to something wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And yet I wasn't experiencing the suffering of the clinging to the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "You know, when you're holding on really tight to that raft and there's no like current, you'll start noticing the ache of the hands and the struggle there to hold on."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I'm wanting it to be here."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "What we need to kind of have in our toolkit is this curiosity of, okay, what's it like to cling to Mudita? Oh, it's not feeling so good, you know, that the mind getting wrapped up in that idea somehow that I need to have this quality."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That's a lot of what happens."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Oh, this is what it's like to be clinging to a wholesome state."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I clung to investigation, you know, when I'm, you know, in the process or working with something that's so sticky like self-hatred."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Of course, it'll cling to these beautiful qualities, having some kind of compassion for ourselves for that too."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And this is what we are looking into right now."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And personally, I feel very touched coming here and seeing the interest of people like you, the interest in the Dharma, in the possibility that it brings into our lives, the possibility of change in regards to bringing more depth and more reflection, contemplation and direct experience into this."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "Because that is sometimes that gets misunderstood."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "This is where we have to start from in our reflections and contemplation."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And I think we have to, when we wake up to, well, yes, there is suffering, and it is unfolding right now, here, turning towards it."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "When we cut out suffering, when we cut out those experiences that we rather don't like to feel, we also cut out the possibility of joy and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "But for some reason you have to, like in the story, like whoever that was, I can't remember."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And that is the suffering on top of the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "But usually we can do it in getting closer to it."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And using wisdom in the way that you also know, okay, this is as much as I can take right now."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And I think that is very important by working, working with suffering."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "By doing so, we turn towards directly experiencing it."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And realizing that actually the work, and he emphasized that we have to do the work together, starting by doing the individual work."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "This is what you are doing."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And discovering that actually I am not just freeing myself from suffering, I do share suffering while I am doing step by step more out of it."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "I would like to offer this to you this morning."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And I open this space now for questions and answers."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "Is there any kind of presence in California for the Saranaloka Foundation? What you're doing for men? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "But it has nothing to do with the Saranaloka Foundation."}

{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "Freedom to do things, freedom to vote, freedom to assembly, freedom to religion, freedom to shop."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And so in Buddhism the focus of spiritual liberation is the freedom from those cravings, the attachments, the greed, the hatred, the conceit that might be operating."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And there's this releasing that can happen, falling away that can happen that we don't have to be so actively involved with."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "They don't understand why it's so important, they don't understand even how to do it, it's kind of a mystery of how it is."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "Nothing had really changed for them, and they were struggling just the way they did before and all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "They felt let down by their practice."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "There's all kinds of things to do."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "Can we experience that feeling of relaxation, that lack of tension that is there, the lack of preoccupation? One of the fascinating things to realize is to agree to which are preoccupations, or a thicket of thoughts and ideas and stories and opinions create a kind of a strong veil or filter through which we see our world."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "To let go deep enough to no longer have that veil and filter, and be able to see through the space that's been created of the absence of clinging or the absence of preoccupation is not an easy thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And there's a lot of this, and the most strongest language in Buddhism for this understanding or potential of freedom, inner freedom, is used, the language that's used in the ancient tradition is to have a vision, to have a vision, to have a deep enough experience of letting go, that the person now has a vision of what is possible, a potential."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And so then a lot of what the practice is about more and more is not about doing, but about allowing, allowing the space to be there, allowing the freedom to be there, allowing the non-clinging to be there."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "Can you get some, it doesn't have to be dramatic, but it can be some, right there is it available."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "So if you hold your hand in a fist for a long time and it begins hurting but you think you're not allowed to let go of it and it hurts even more, but after a while someone says, you know, by the way, the Buddha comes along and says, by the way, you don't have to hold a fist."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "So a number of things happen when you relax and open up the fingers."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "You can also express a lot more wonderful things, I think."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "But it's become habitual, it's become normal."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And then when we're over with big distraction, we realize that some of our big things that we're upset about or concerned with are no longer there."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "It feels like not to have these things, to be free of it for those few moments."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "It sounded like it was engaging and so I hope that was the case."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "May it be your constant companion."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And it's a question about refuge."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "These people will be with me and they help keep me safe."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And so all of those things are kind of normal ways that we might, in our ordinary lives, perhaps before we kind of come up against this deep truth of unreliability, that is the nature of experience, it's the nature of life."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "But at some point, at some point in our lives, we will find out, we will recognize."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "It's very tender actually."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "It's based in a misperception that there is something out there in the material world, in the realm of relationship or in the realm of my capacity to choose and to do."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "The Buddha didn't have anybody to tell him this."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So he was kind of launching out into his journey with, well, maybe there's, maybe it's possible."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So the ease and the peace that comes is in aligning ourselves with that truth."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "It's such a different way to think about refuge, rather than going and finding someplace where we can hide out."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "But also I think of it as the capacity, the possibility of awakening."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "We don't initially don't have any sense, at least for myself."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "During another retreat earlier this year, you also said that awareness together with right view is trustable."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So as I was pointing to a few minutes ago, you know, when we try to take refuge in something that's unreliable, we will experience suffering."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And when we have that place of awareness and wisdom when awareness and wisdom is operating."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So, you know, if anger is arising and we're meeting it with awareness and wisdom, there's a trust that."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So there's a kind of a way that that awareness and wisdom together is trustable in the moments where it's happening."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "We might be able to keep our head just above water because we know it's possible."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "It's like the refuge is there."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "Where I worked close to UCLA, there's a large federal veteran cemetery."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "Now the, the Buddha was, you know, the contemplation of, of death was so, so central."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And it's a kind of progressive schedule of practices, and it's typically done in a group and includes doing things as, you know, as intense as I wrote my own eulogy, and then, you know, as all of the students in the group did, and then read it to the group."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And I remember, I remember, you know, telling her about, you know, some, some of the experiences with, with the year to live program."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "Gil said something I was quite struck by as we reflect on themes around mortality or impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "The one thing people tend to realize at moments like this is that we've wasted a lot of time when life was normal."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "We raise this issue to actually see the burden on the heart that's created when we refuse it."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And this is terror in not in the sense of terrorism, but intense fright."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "When you bring people into a laboratory and ask them to, as I'm asking now, for us to reflect on these themes."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "But we actually, some of the clinging to these kinds of identifications comes out of a way of disavowing the finiteness of our life."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "I had always sort of subtly assumed that something or someone was keeping me safe."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "But the response in that groundlessness really can be open-heartedness."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And death is maybe the greatest way."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "But that shuts off sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And in those moments when we feel, when the heart feels very free, it feels like there's a dawning of a sense of nothing can be lost."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And it's my aspiration for all of my days to be a good day to die, to live in a way that feels like complete."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And this is a New Year's poem, it was written on January 1, 1946, and this was his first New Year's after being released from the internment camps."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "A nameless monk may not have the New Year callers to visit him, but the morning sun hangs above the slums."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "May we know the goodness of the open heart, and find safety amidst letting go."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "And for many people, I think many English-speaking people would say that emotions are a central aspect of life, and a very important aspect of life, that emotions are, for some people, is how they navigate the world, understand the world, understand themselves."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "We often assume we know what the emotions are, and we often very quickly will identify."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "But as a category, emotions, which some people have very strong opinions about, it's actually hard to pin down exactly what it is and define it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "And so that's kind of like a stunning statement."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And he made this offer three times, which was the Indian way of saying, okay, I'm serious about this, if anybody has any doubts, go ahead."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You wonder why is this suffering happening to me? And then this followed by a search."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So you have doubts about your suffering, why it's happening."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And so this, because he'd found the end of suffering by asking himself questions, he also encouraged his students that they should ask questions about their own actions, what they were doing that was skillful, until they could finally get to their desired results."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "In terms of his motivation, it was basically the Buddha's compassion."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It wasn't just that the teacher gets up there and teaches something that sounds nice and everybody accepts it and goes home."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "The implication there of course is there's something that you're doing right now that is causing the suffering or experiencing."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Or if you deny that you have any choices in the present moment, again the Buddha would come in and confront you."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You're not giving the student a foundation for looking into what should and should not be done."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It's like the question in, I've forgotten the name of the book now, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "The first one, is this true? Secondly, is it beneficial? If it's not beneficial, even though it was true, he would not discuss it."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Now, in some cases that would be because he felt the person would not understand his answer when he gave it, so he wanted to make sure that they were looking at it from the right framework."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "He would pose an analogy or usually give an example and then ask questions of the other person, basically get the other person to commit to a particular interpretation of the example, and then he'd got them."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And finally, there are questions that would be put aside."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "In other words, the question, the framework of the question is totally wrong."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And so we can look for his little flagging comments about what he's about to say when he's going to ask a cross-question or when he's going to give an analytical answer or put something aside."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Now, when you're listening to the Dharma, the question should always be is this relevant to putting an end to suffering? If so, how can I apply it to my own suffering? That's the appropriate way to listen to a Dharma talk."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "One is when you learn how to read specific sutras, you look at the framing questions."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "For example, one of the first questions you're hearing in Buddha's 101 all the time, again, if there is no self, then who does actions and who receives the result of actions? That's taking the teaching on Anata as a foundational teaching and the questions of karma would have to fit into this teaching."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And when you use anicha, it's basically to see this thing that I've been going for, is it really a satisfactory result? And if the happiness is impermanent, OK, it's not up to snuff."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Is there a being, is there no being? He never says there's no being."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But it's a process that we're continually doing."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But if you have this belief that ultimately there is no agent and there is no self, it teaches irresponsibility."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But that's still suffering."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I might not have an affair tomorrow, but it's a cop out."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You can approach that teaching in any way at all, which is not really helpful."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "The path is a raft across this flood of views."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Whereas the Buddha says you have right view, which is part of that raft."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "That's the rest of the path."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So you ask the questions of what am I doing? What are the results as opposed to who am I? Where am I? Kind of like the amnesiac questions."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Secondly, seeing it passing away."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But then, okay, there's a part of you that actually enjoys it."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And then finally, what are the drawbacks? And this is where the Buddha brings in these questions."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You say, look, pizzas are inconstant, stressful, not self."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "How can we account for that or talk about that? What are you holding on to in the meantime? Excuse me? What are you holding on to in the meantime as you're noticing those things? Hopefully less and less."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Until that time, you take it as a working hypothesis."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "We'll get later in the question, but is there a self, is there no self? That's one of the ones the Buddha put aside."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And I found that being a junior monk, I could say, don't ask me, ask Ajahn Fuhram."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And spend a lot of time just sort of spinning with those questions and never necessarily even moving into what the Buddha was teaching."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Okay, there's a third alternative which is the Buddha sounds intriguing."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Let's do what needs to be done in order to prove him right or wrong."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I can learn all that I can do."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I can put all my effort into understanding all of these teachings in the canon and still maybe not get out of my suffering."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Or simplify that to say these Four Noble Truths for today or for this moment where is the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Also, how do I get my mind to settle down? Basic stuff."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So yesterday afternoon, I'm working at my desk and I'm starting to feel off."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And I'm asking then the question, why am I feeling off? But I keep asking that question and it doesn't lead me anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But I feel that mentally, like if I go the mental path, I couldn't ask the question that would lead me there."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So are you advising to go the physical route? I'd say go the physical route, at least even though something is bothering my mind, I can at least not let it hijack my breath when I'm breathing."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And then when you're about to be finished, then you erase the pencil marks."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "That's something completely different, okay."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Because I've been studying Buddhism for seven years now."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And now I'm going to go see, you know, psychotherapists."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Well, sometimes you have to dig up some things."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "If you want to put in end of suffering, this is what you've got to do."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "In the early suttas, it means foremost goal."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "In other words, this is where you're trying to go."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And again, you use them to get to a certain point and then you let them go."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "When you get to the Four Noble Truths, those terms get dropped."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It depends on how you frame things."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So let's look at some of the examples of the teachings that the Buddha gives categorical answers to."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So we're looking at passage number 21 on page one."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And then finally, idle chatter."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Which comes up with the question that you're at work, there's a certain amount of social grease that needs to be done in order to keep the workplace going."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Ill will, wanting to see somebody suffer."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And as a result he went, got dementia."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And so one of the ones I chose was that one."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "No, I teach what's skillful and what's not skillful."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Which he goes on to later."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Any questions about those positions that the Buddha did not take? We'll get back to this topic later on when he starts explaining why he did not take those positions."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "But you come home from work and boy, I had a lot of stress today."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "What he gained awakening to was like the leaves in the forest."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "These are instructions, instructions of what we should do so that we can prime ourselves so that when we engage in the world, we're not going to have to suffer from our engagement."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "See how empty it is? Yeah, get the message."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So it's not just you stewing about your actions, but you get some advice."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And then you resolve, okay, I'm not going to repeat it."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It's obvious when X is something impermanent that it's going to change."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It seemed like when you're saying it's almost like feeding."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Sometimes in some talks by many people clinging and craving seem to be getting confused or they're used as synonyms."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I'm thirsting for something."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So a perceptual, the perceptual."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You say, I cannot imagine myself living without X."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You're the one who needs it, you know."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So you have to learn how to change your perception."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I mean, this is the weakness of using stress to translate duke, because sometimes, you know, if you say you were run over by a car and you're really stressed out."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Other questions do not make sense."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And that requires just to keep trying to remind yourself."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Which is why it's good to take little meditation breaks throughout the day."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And see how much longer I can maintain it."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Otherwise you become like the kind of person who goes down to the gym, lifts weights and comes home and doesn't lift a finger."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I guess what I mean is as you practice, would it become automatic? No, you have to intend to apply it."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "My other question is for the mental stress, is there any part of it that's related to biological factors? So it might not be as easy to."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "There's part of the mind that does this."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "They have other needs as well, they have more mental needs."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And I typed in the address on his phone, and he thanked me, shook my hand, and went back to work."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "I said, if I had told him that I meant just learning how to be with him, and because his complaint was he had a miserable job, and he was surrounded by dishonest people, and it was really hard for him to find happiness."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Is that a fair way to look at it? No, you do have to have some idea of what the goal is."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Every now and then you check your rear-view mirror to make sure the mountain is not behind you."}
{"prompt": "The Potential of Metta, part 3 (relating to relationships)", "completion": "And studies, scientific studies in the last couple of decades suggest that the science can back this up."}
{"prompt": "The Potential of Metta, part 3 (relating to relationships)", "completion": "Another human that we can come into synchrony when there's kindness and compassion there that it has a palpable effect on our entire system."}

{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "Ultimately, our insights need to take life in the form of relationship, need to be brought to bear to lead to more harmonious ways of being together."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "There's just a real sense of trust in that."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "Listening is a great gift and skill to offer people."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "The Buddhist teachings often come back to this phrase of something like, nothing whatsoever should be clung to as I or mine."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "And in the same way when we cling to a sense of self, we become rigid."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "So another way of putting it is that Dharma practice makes us less and less offendable."}
{"prompt": "How We Relate To Each Other", "completion": "We're not exerting a kind of our own ego pressure on another."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And then as he always says, why is this so? Well, because the means for procuring oil is not being undertaken."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "But if we don't know what it is that causes suffering, well then we're not going to know in which direction to turn to free ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "But when we hear that it's craving that binds us to this round of birth and death, or binds us to suffering, at first glance, it may not make a whole lot of sense to us, especially if we're coming from the perspective of ignorance, and not to offend anybody, but most of us come from that perspective of not knowing, especially before we come to the Dharma, and for quite a while in the earlier stages of the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Because of acquisition, there is decision."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Because of possessiveness, there is avarice."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And this direct translation means thirst, which is actually a more apt description of what craving really is."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Because it's about annoying, nagging thirst that is never satisfied."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "The Buddha tells us, and this is important for us to understand, the Buddha tells us that we've been locked, we've been bound to craving for endless eons, countless eons."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "I'm going to have overcome craving."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "How am I relating to this moment now? Is there craving that's present? So we can turn around this contracted, perhaps, craving to let go."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "So rather, can we turn this around and bring in the wholesome kind of want to be free ourselves from suffering? Because this is often a confusion."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "So our language is rather limited."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "You might also use the phrase, a wise conviction."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And for each of us, it may be a different one of these sense doors that is our particular nemesis."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And so here I was seeing these incredible frames, and before I knew it, some of the pictures, the simple pictures I have at home, I was getting rid of that frame and replacing it with one of these really exquisite frames and then realizing, wait a minute, wait a minute, it's just seeing, seeing, so you can go backwards."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "This is amongst all the others too, but particularly this craving, wanting mind."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "So now there are tons of hummingbirds that are there all the time."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And so I went to the best store at the airport, which was Harrods, I thought it was Harrods, so I bought this little box, small little box of high quality chocolate coated almonds with, you know, they get this cocoa powder over them."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "This is what had all of my good intentions for generosity out the window."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "The craving to have some future pleasant existence."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Easeful, the mind is not too distracted."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Everything is going perfectly well."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "But fortunately, awareness rose to the fore."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "How to work with it? Well, simply notice desire."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "Just notice desire has arisen in the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "I saw clearly that it was impermanent."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "See it as just an impermanent arising."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "So this energetically is the opposite kind of move."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "I use this because sometimes I see myself going to a party."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And although the physical bodily movement is moving forward, inwardly, energetically, I'm pulling away."}

{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "It's born out of the wrong view of self."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "The desire, the craving, the wanting that arises is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "And we can taste these little moments, instances where we've let go of not needing to have that craving that's arisen in the mind met."}
{"prompt": "The Wanting Mind", "completion": "When we see for ourselves, when we're caught in the grip of craving ourselves, the suffering that it brings, and we know what to do."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And so there's an invitation to investigate, what am I doing to my experience? And what ways am I imposing a certain narrative structure on what's happening here, on the messiness of experience itself? How am I fashioning my world? And sometimes we really paper over the kind of messiness, the intuitive sense of like, oh, it's messy, it's messy."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "We paper over that with Dharma concepts."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "There's a measure of alienation in that."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And the abandonment itself is painful, yeah? It's like we, yeah, we're in that gesture of pretending something like the authentic heart is abandoned."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And we want to listen to ourselves with that spirit, yeah? Of not misconstruing ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "Like when I used to do clinical research and it would do, it was involved with clinical trials, yeah, and of medications or potential medications and they're often a couple of questions."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "We want to convince ourselves that we're doing it right, you know, that we're doing it right and it's worth doing."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "It would be clear what we would do, clearer."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "We are exploring together and with all of the, the not knowing and all of the, the patience that I'm suggesting and all of the ambiguity, the complications, the messiness through all of that, we are supported by faith."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "Where would you have to do and want to do converge? Now all this said, there are still sometimes points in practice where nothing works."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "The sense of helplessness, it's among the most potent in the whole array of human experiences."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And so when he senses helplessness, he senses the desperation, the abject poverty in which we find ourselves in some moments."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "All he knows how to do is place blame somewhere."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And these moments, yeah, when the ego is all out of moves, they can be humiliating, but the invitation is for them merely to be humbling, humbling rather than humiliating."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "Yeah, Michelle McDonald says sometimes people are like in the insight of it and not catching it, just missing it, getting caught in it."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And knowing helplessness, knowing it with clarity, knowing it with pristine clarity, shows us the importance of kindness."}
{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And this becomes this like encounter with ourselves, with the places of desperation, becomes a wellspring of compassion, yeah? And it consolidates our motivation to practice."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Continuing this afternoon to explore, reflect on clear comprehension of non-delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "The word characteristic makes it seem like there is something out there that has a property of being impermanent."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I was sitting in my meditation and I heard the words of my teacher telling me, notice your relationship to dukkha."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so the Buddha points to, and like given that all experience, every single moment of every day, these perceptions are available to be seen in every experience."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I am of the nature to die."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "This is kind of using our cognitive, our wisdom to remember this."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "You can use it in many ways."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And I was a veggie chopper on this particular retreat."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And it's like, okay, yes, it's now it's a cut up zucchini."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Now, this is not the insight into impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "It's a conscious reflection."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And I walked in there and just like, Oh, my goodness, we'll never finish this in 45 minutes."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And at some point, and I had my head kind of down, I think, and I was just doing, you know, grabbing some charred and chopping it and grabbing some more and chopping it."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And sometimes I looked up and the pile was gone."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And at one point, Carlos Castaneda became a kind of a teacher in this, in this tradition, and he was said to be having dinner with a group of people."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "My partner, my parents, my siblings of the nature to age, sicken and die, that can have a very profound effect on the heart."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I didn't see it arise, but here it is."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I'm right in the middle of it."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So this description of arise, persist, and pass away, being very experiential, it's a little different in a way than the commentarial description of experience, that every single moment is an arising and ceasing."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Encouraged us to notice this around, around the sense experience."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And, and seeing too at these very refined level in the meditative kind of place of seeing that there's nothing that lasts for more than a split second, that level of seeing impermanence has a very profound effect on the mind understanding nothing is worth clinging to."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Those qualities in contrast to the dynamic influx experience that awareness meets can help us to disidentify with many of the ways that we suffer."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "That's a kind of a, we could say it's a kind of a signpost or a kind of a a warning flare that says, hey, you know, delusions happening, some things being clung to, some things being misattributed here."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "There's a deeper kind of ease that happens as we maybe come into alignment with the nature of experience, the nature even of that awareness of mindfulness, of consciousness as impermanent in flux."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I don't know if it's his analogy or if he heard it somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then you might, you don't have to try to track this, but you might notice during the guided meditation that we'll be kind of going through this."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "So the first part of the sutta talks about just establishing being aware while breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And he uses the translation for this word experiencing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Softening the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, hips."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Around the heart, maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax, and then to seeing perhaps the mind can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "from this place of as much relaxation as is currently available, having kind of a sense of inviting the breath in to awareness, rather than looking for it or trying to find the breathing anywhere, just exploring the possibility of breathing and knowing that you're breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Might be in the nose or mouth, the back of the throat, might be the movement of the chest, the expansion and contraction, rising and falling of the abdomen, and it may be that the place or the kind of sense of the experience, the physical bodily experience of breathing is broader than one particular place, might be a bigger area in the torso or maybe it's a sense of kind of following the breath in and out, just noticing how, how, how, how is the body sensitive to the breathing right now? And exploring a very receptive sense of that, receiving that sensitivity of the body, letting the body show you how it experiences the breathing, settling back and relax and receive the breath in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Knowing you're breathing in, knowing you're breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Feeling insensitive to the body, my exploration of this, allowing the bubble to broaden."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "If it feels stressful to try to be expanding to the whole body, just allowing there to be a receiving of experience in whatever part of the body that's comfortable to receive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Breathing out sensitive to the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Breathing out sensitive to the body."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And it is the more fundamental of these three roots that tend to lead us to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "Because the feeling of greed is that pull towards something."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "But the delusion embedded in that is that I'm not okay unless I get that thing."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "That it actually believes that this is going to do it for me."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So we kind of get stuck on that chain, on that chain of cycle, needing to have something."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So boredom can be a subtle aversion, just a subtle like wish something else were happening."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "This reminds me of the next piece in the Satipatana Sutra in the third foundation."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "The mind affected by delusion is a mind affected by delusion."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "I highlighted that a little bit in the guided meditation, just noticing that moment, mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "They shape political beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So we don't see that it's a perspective that has been shaped, a view, a belief."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So this question sometimes I ask myself, when I'm suffering, so when you're suffering, this is another good little tool here, so when you're suffering, some kind of view is operating."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "This was just information that they were given."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So it's useful in many strategies, in many ways to survive."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And that is that we tend to take what is impermanent to be permanent."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And there's a kind of certain, with certain kinds of experiences, the change is so gradual that our system doesn't perceive the change moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And it used to be that, you know, the snow was on the mountains year round."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "There's different ways that our mind is designed to create this stability."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "That we believe that either the world is betraying us or somebody else has, has done us wrong or that we failed because things seem unreliable."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "Greed and aversion are not okay with impermanent, unreliable."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "This is a fundamental confusion."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So, you know, it's when something unpleasant ends, we might experience a kind of a relief."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And so, you know, noticing that relationship."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So I think that's, that's, that's a good support, the compassion that it's hard."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "You know, so in that moment that seeing that, and it seems the absence of delusion has this kind of quality of seeming so simple and so obvious."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "It's like, how could I not have seen this? And then like three seconds later, that view or that delusion comes back and it is not obvious anymore."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And that's what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And so you want to have lots of pleasure because that's how you feel rewarded."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "It feels so alive and so connected."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Some people fear in doing things that are frightening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "They don't have any other time in their life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "I saw a little documentary about a man who had spent his early part of his adult life spending a lot of time, like on the weekends, riding his motorcycle all over."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But if you're simply taking in the pleasure of it, that's what you're being, then it's only of the senses."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "That did something special, just a simple thing she did."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And so have you had any experiences where there was enough sense of well-being, of safety, of quiet, of comfort or something, the environment was just right, that you felt something not so much nourished from the outside but allowed something inside to settle, to open, to be at ease, to feel safe, so that there was a wellspring within that began to flow and move through you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And, you know, he didn't have Netflix."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Early in my meditation practice, many years ago, I would have gotten so caught up and preoccupied, oh, I shouldn't be breathing that way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And because of this kind of negativity bias, perhaps, or this idea that I'm supposed to deal with these problems, everything's supposed to be different."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And I was so surprised when I went to."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "It's just packed with organs and everything."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "The space is not real space, but it's the space that of."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Or giving that has a feeling of love with it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "I'm supposed to be this way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "In fact, to be fixated on what's uncomfortable, what's difficult emotionally, physically in the world, the fixation is a bad influence on us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And the peripheral context, what I mean is if we're involved with our breathing, for example, that's the primary center of our attention, meditating, we're not only taking in the breathing, hang on for dear life, but we're also, the peripheral attention takes in the goodness, the subtle, very subtle, perhaps, pleasure, well-being of the situation we're in, maybe physically, to feel where it does feel good."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And now breathe with the impatience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And in this way, pleasure overcomes attachment to pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But I hope what it did was at least turn the mirror back to yourself to see what is some way that you know, in your terms, in your experience, what I've been talking about, something that would be useful for you to take more time with and make room for and not be in a hurry for and not be tricked by the mind's preoccupations and the mind's to-do list and the mind's previous conditioning that maybe gets you kind of constantly on the treadmill of doing things which actually continue being a poor influence on you but being able to shift in gears to allow a healthy, appropriate new influence, new conditioning that allows you then to take in and benefit from the deeper and deeper way that mindfulness can gather you together to be really present for your experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "There's nothing inherently wrong with sensual pleasure and so in Buddhism we're not dismissing sensual pleasure offhand, it's the attachment to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Because of this negativity bias, because of the preoccupation with it, because of the ways which our thinking gets so pulled into that world that we're just thinking about it all the time."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But you first have to stop long enough to check it out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe there can be a pleasant relaxation of mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe emotions or feelings, sounds, moods."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Or if it's more natural for you, it's also fine to kind of tune in to one particular area of experience and then receive that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Remembering that that is a condition that's very supportive for our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's also fine if it feels supportive for you to stay with the relaxation, that exploration of relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But I hope that doesn't frighten you, but instead excites you about the depth that's possible in this practice."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And it's influenced as well by the teachings of the Buddhist psychology, the branch of Buddhist psychology called the Abhidharma."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And in 2003, I blocked out some time for a one-year retreat."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And because it was such an intensive retreat, some of my teachers had thought that I might like to write about it and explore it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so I wrote Focused and Fearless, which uses the breath as the primary object, gives the instructions for developing concentration and jhana in the formal retreat practice, but primarily emphasizes the cultivation of concentration in daily life and just how do we work with the mind that is so often distracted and disabling for us."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "They provide pleasant abidings, they make us happy, we can rest in a blissful state."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And he must have asked me at least a dozen times, probably many more than that, to write this book."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "They require certain conditions, but many of us are able to do retreat practice to some rather significant degree, even in the context of a lay life."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And it was important to me that these teachings not be available only to monastics or only to people who go off to Asia, but that the practical way of actually doing these traditional practices are available to us."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "There is many different objects that we can use other than the breath."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "We can use the parts of the body up to the first Jhana, and we can use the colors and the elements up to the fourth Jhana."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And then the mental functions are broken down into very, very quick and rapid mental events."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so we use the concentrated mind to be able to look very carefully at the nature of the body and the nature of mind internally."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Now, I say easy, but that's maybe, maybe it's not true that it's easy."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And in that retreat, we went through the whole thing systematically again, refining the understanding of each section, exploring it in more detail."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "We can live in a way that allows us to, as soon as we settle back down in meditation and warm up a little bit and bring the attention to our meditation object, that we can settle deeply and quickly."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But that process happens very rapidly, so we can experience deep concentration even in our daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "We have to have a resolve to focus our mind on one object and then stay there."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so there are specific ways that we bring intention into the concentration practice that also are applicable to daily life."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "There might be some rare people out there who have a natural gift for concentration who are able to do it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But it's not easy to maintain either."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And I find, especially in the afternoon, that I have so many little restlessnesses and needs to move around and I have to keep changing position."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And then when I have to move, the whole thing dissipates."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But they would keep arising."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And then we can set it aside and focus back on the breath."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But after you've seen it many, many times, then it's fine to just sweep it aside and bring a stronger resolve to stay with your meditation object."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But if it's the same old, oh yeah, my shoulder gets sore after about 40 minutes, and I still have 20 minutes that I want to sit, but I know that it's not going to hurt me, then you recognize it and then you settle back in."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And they just brush aside and then there'll be a period of time where no hindrance arises."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "As we get close to Jhana, the hindrance is just, they just don't arise."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so that's still part of the practice."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And I think my next task is to deepen and lengthen my ability to concentrate."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "For those of you who aren't familiar with the term Papancha, it refers to the proliferating tendencies of mind."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So, but you say blocking out."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Other times we're going to be so curious we want to understand how does perception function, what happens when I see the color green? How do I know green? And what is the relationship to green? Not just am I greedy for green, but how does it work? And what are the subtle, subtle, subtle components that in any way keep perpetuating a craving for existence, a craving for contact, a craving for sensory pleasures, a craving for anything? So the depth that we can explore too is what one of the things, the Buddha said, the depths of the concentrated mind are unfathomable."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And the depth of insight must lead to an ultimate liberation."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "But at some level we've all adopted a kind of model of the good life, a way of being happy."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And part of what meditation practice is doing is we get to examine like what is it that I actually believe brings happiness."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And one of the things that I think we find is that we have some faith that clinging is going to work."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "We want and get drunk with wanting, then the headache and bitterness afterward."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "The opportunity with meditation though is actually to see how this happens, to see the mechanisms by which we do cling."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Some of you might have the desire to become the Buddha of the age, Maitreya radiating love throughout the world."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And yet like all at the same time it hit him that he's not going to be able to hold on forever."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Whereas clinging craving is always bigger than its object."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "So the Burmese teacher sighed out, Andrea's teacher was asked if you can like something, and it not be a form of clinging."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "But when it's under the radar of awareness, when for example all of our cravings and clinging are trying to gratify them, and a lot of times it works out, I can go get a slice of pizza."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "So the Buddha directs us to four places to look for where clinging arises."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "It's not like people become enlightened and then they choose dirt over pizza or something, right? We don't have to be dismissive of that, but we also have to look with kind of clear eyes."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "For one thing we tend to view it as a rare and bizarre."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Of all the things we are wrong about this error might well top the list."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Abraham gives a thumbs up."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And that is to look at mental practice, loving kindness practice, forgiveness practice, this cultivating this warm heartedness."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "We can do a whole retreat just on this part, but I'll start with some of this."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Maybe we could just say, well, what is this whole idea of Buddhist practice? I'm going to define it or talk about it as this movement, this intention, this aspiration to go towards greater understanding."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "You know, there's different words that we use and there's different words that make sense in different settings."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And there might be all these ways in which we are unknowingly abandoning ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "That's, you know, and flies are bigger than ants and what a difficulty that is."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And you could use a little improvement."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So I know this is a gross oversimplification but sometimes it's helpful to have these generalizations about practice, we need both cultivation and letting go."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "We might have stumbled upon or discovered some ideas that we have about ourselves that aren't helpful."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And with that growth comes a different perspective."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And these different perspectives, there's just, we recognize, I don't need this other perspective anymore."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "For me, I was one of those people who wore a white coat and hung out with test tubes all day."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "It's something entirely different to let go of an identity if we have this sense of inner strength, inner confidence."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Maybe as a consequence of having spent this week with it to becomes a little bit more accessible to us."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And it becomes a guide for how to be in the world and that way gives us some stability."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So in this way, loving kindness, cultivating loving kindness is helping supporting and letting go of ill will, hatred, supporting our movement towards awakening."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Neurosities at first, and then ethical behavior, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, resolve, loving kindness, and equanimity."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "I have to cultivate because I don't have enough."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "For example, is there a way that just recognizing that appreciation and gratitude."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "We all have times in which we're kind and warm hearted, maybe towards ourselves towards others."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And then with that is also to notice when there's these minor moments of irritation in patients resentment or ill will."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "You know that at IMC we're teaching this year-long course that's called the Equivalence of Ethics and Enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Which of course loving kindness is intimately related with care and respect too."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "We start being carried by this wholesome, healthy direction of practice of ah."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "The last quality is the dhamma is to be experienced directly, actually the language is, this dhamma is to be personally experienced by the wise."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "Now, Indian society, perhaps, I mean, it wasn't under the occupation, obviously, but Palestine was under that particular period with the Roman occupation, with Jesus, and so you probably haven't got the kind of same conflictual elements going on within it, but you're certainly finding a figure who is very unpopular, and there's a number of attempts made on the Buddha's life throughout the text, you know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "The Buddha will give his response and his reply, and on a number of occasions, they go away shaking their heads saying, this is rubbish, I don't understand what he's saying."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "We're cultivating particular dimensions of experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "It actually, again, is mistranslated."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "So that's the bedrock it relates, rests on."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "And often these translations mislead us in what they're doing."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "And this is true in many areas of Buddhism but we understand the wholesome qualities or the beautiful qualities or we understand the way we understand something is by looking at what gets in its way and so the way we can understand the way we can to understand the teaching of not self is by getting really familiar with what we think of as self with what we with what we how we identify how we constrict there how we how we believe ourselves to be a somebody."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "So the the question came up as I was talking about it because often our senses of self not always but often our senses of self are kind of connected with areas of struggle ways that we get constricted."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "And the only thing I can really do is just kind of write it out."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "And if I write it out then awareness sees what's happening and then there's wisdom about it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "It's unfamiliar, let's say."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "And there can be a kind of a hanging in that space in the discomfort of that space, hovering there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not Self and Compassion", "completion": "And it's kind of like the mind has to adjust to that, to that disorientation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And, you know, if you cannot be afraid of that fear, you know, it actually serves you."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Mostly the kind of fear I'm going to talk about is what we could call maybe constructed fear, or fear that comes around projecting into the future, ideas into the future of, it's going to be like that, and I don't want it that way, or I'm afraid it's going to be like that, and what's going to happen if it's like that, and what are people going to think of me, and how am I going to do this, or that, you know, that that can move into fear, anxiety, worry."}

{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Often it's in the stomach or in the throat."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "But what if, but what if, but what if? What is it like now? What is it like? What's happening here? Those are thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So that condition there, if that condition, even close to that condition is repeated, if you're driving down the freeway and a truck drives up next to you, fear might arise because of the similarity of the situation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "There's probably a little bit of thinking happening there, but I think largely it's that there's kind of been a direct sense wiring almost because of a traumatic situation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So how do we respond to fear? For me, I think my first response, my immediate response is, how can I fix this situation? How can I get control of this situation? That's usually my first thing is, okay, here's a problem, how do I fix it? How do I control it? I also find with fear there can be, if it's not something immediate happening, but there's a sense that might happen in the future, my mind will also do a kind of a proliferating projection of, well, how many different ways can I think of how to avoid that thing that might happen? So it's like, well, what if that happens? Or what if that's the path things take? What if that's the path things take? Or in the anxiety worry category, I think, rather than the actual fear category."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So that perfect control gives me a sense of, oh, I'm okay."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And what I've seen over and over again is that when I actually get to something that might approximate the situation, first of all, I almost never have imagined it to be exactly the way it is."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So there's something else going on there."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I've not been able to do that because there's other things happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It gives us a little bit of a distance too from the way our mind is proliferating around the fear, all of those thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And it gives us a little bit of a chance to look more rationally at those thoughts as opposed to being hooked into them."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "These constructions that I'm making are just constructions."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I mean, you know, this is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's just a passing phenomenon."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "These thoughts are created by conditions, maybe recognizing how some triggers came into play."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Another really helpful thing around fear."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's like, no, you know, I don't want to pay attention to that."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Yeah, everything's changing."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Because much of the reason fear comes about is because life is out of our control."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So we try to live our lives shoring up our little bit of permanence here and a little bit of control there and think that we've got things okay for a little while and then that one falls apart a little bit and then we shore it up over here a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "This is all story and I actually began to tap into what is one of the antidotes to fear, which is meta."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And I would come back to the meta."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And that the meta was a more wholesome expression of that wish."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So it's interesting sometimes when we have fear, anxiety, worry, maybe to see what truth is being pointed to."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It was true that I didn't know, but what I was afraid of was the idea."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's like, okay, I can't face the unknown right now, but fear."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's like, oh, I'm not the greatest meditator."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I think that's the point that I was trying to get to."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And once you can recognize it, what I want to make sure I understood what you said, is then one of the ways you recognize it and then come into the body."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Yes, that's a really helpful way to let go of that mental proliferation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I've seen sometimes a proliferation into, oh, I'm going to have such a great time being with those friends and blah, blah, blah, into the mind going off into all that story."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And I've spent a lot of time during meditation and really kind of throughout my days, I spent a couple of days where I meditated like multiple times, kind of for long periods of time and really made an effort to set the story aside."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And I felt and feel a lot better, except now I feel like it's sort of lurking."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's just sort of like I put it outside the house and now I can't leave the house."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And that's the emotions, the feelings associated with it."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And just take like a little bite."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And I guess I was invited to give the sermon, but when I got there they called it the lesson."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And the new way can kind of present kind of almost like a different world to live in than the old way."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And you can kind of watch that kind of moving through."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "So insight into something."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "To be disenchanted with suffering is to no longer be interested and willing to go along with the fact that we're suffering and just accept it."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "It's a kind of happiness and well-being perhaps that's not so easily blown away by the causes and conditions of the world."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "But somehow it seems like that things are changing, that things are ephemeral."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "I don't know if it's a kind of a downer to listen to, I don't know what it's like."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And so to really take in the changing nature of life and really take it in, I think it gives a kind of depth that in some ways I think is very satisfying."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Because somehow they've lived through many of the changes that life puts us through."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And that's the impermanence when we experience things without the filter of our labels, the filter of our concepts that we overlay it to give things a semblance of permanence."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "We do it to ourselves, we do it to other people, we do it to our experiences in life all too often."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And there tends to be a lot less permanence in our makeup than who we are."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And if somehow you can step out of the ideas, you'll have a different perception of what's actually going on."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "It developed a lot of wisdom around this idea because human life, we need to develop wisdom around this idea."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "But the person only knew that this was what human life was about and this was what his practice was about, was clarifying this one area."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Or certainly not the ultimate kind of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "There's a sense of presence that can rest and be at peace in itself."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "But you're going to miss that flip where you can see another possibility."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "So the insights part of mindfulness is a lot to do with training to relax the mind enough so we're not thinking about things anymore."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "I mean, not even things that are far away, like in the past and the future, but not even thinking about what's happening in the present."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "We become more fully perceptive of what is going on right here and now."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And it's really phenomenal to enter into deeply into the world of insight and permanence, to realize or to experience how quickly and thoroughly things are constantly changing and shifting."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And even something we thought was permanent, or assumed was permanent, it's not."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "It's so much trust in the heart that you just no need to contract, no need to hold on, no matter what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And perhaps that will add depth and freedom to your experience of the life that you're living this week."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You're looking after your own good."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But actually, that activity of merit is the Buddha's preliminary answer to the question that he says lies at the basis of discernment, which is what when I do it will lead to long-term welfare and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "These are the basic activities of merit."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And you can actually help other people by getting them to water the good seeds so that they can get past a position of being disadvantaged."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So karma doesn't say that people have to stay the way they are."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And he goes in and Anguli Mala sees him and decides to, here's a finger he would like."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Nobody would ever get there."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But the extent to which those results will be experienced will depend on your mind state when those actions ripen."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And the person who suffers a lot from that past one, he's compared to a poor person, who if he steals a goat or steals gold, because he is poor he's going to go to jail."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "In terms of the beginning point, the Buddhist says, you know, the beginning point of time is not only unknowable, it's also inconceivable."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So if you start tracing things back like that, you don't know where can you begin, because there is no beginning point."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "It's not for the basis of compassion, it's for the basis of dismay."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "His second knowledge was the question, this is a process of rebirth applied only to him, and if it applies to others as well, what's the mechanism underlying it? That's when he saw that it was people's karma."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "For in this universe, there are no ends."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "The passage actually says, you try to protect your good will in all situations in the same way a mother would protect her child in all situations."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So in other words, the road to true happiness is not selfish."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Now in the case of the gamatana sect, you know, John Mann became an arahant and he's sort of out of samsara."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And when I came out of my meditation, my purse was gone."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Buddhism, in contrast, is just setting aside the whole idea of a just war."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "He spoke more as an expert."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Love, however, the Buddha says is potentially divisive."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "It's just you say it would be good if this person could act on the causes for true happiness and understand those causes and be willing to do that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Equanimity is the counteractant for that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And you can point out to them there are ways in which it does happen in this lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But I remember when I was a kid, it was taught in civics classes that a stable society requires a large middle class."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Because like, common humanity is not a universal concept? It is a universal concept, but some people would say, well, common humanity is mitigated by the fact that some people are smarter about their money than others."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Thank you for your questions and your interest."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "Agitation can be coarse, and many people associate meditation with becoming calm."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "But when we're deeply calm, we still see there's a little bit of agitation, tension, pressure."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "So learning to recognize the contrast between calm and agitation, learning to be accepting of agitation so that we can be aware of it carefully and fully, is an important part of this path to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "And so if you have some agitation in your meditation, then it certainly means you're not fully awakened, but it also means that you're human, and this is part of the parcel of being human that we're working with and becoming wise about how to be with agitation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "And there was something about the cool, clear, crisp air, the history of the chapel, maybe, the atmosphere there or the associations I had with it, who knows."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "You can feel it's a certain place and it tends to ground or settle or gather or kind of tie consciousness to a bounded, smaller, tighter place within."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "One is just become attuned to the presence of agitation and calm."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "And so one saying, we could say, to assert the self is to be agitated."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "To forget the self is to be calm and wise."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Maybe the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Maybe too there can be a relaxation of the mind of mental tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Letting go of worries, concerns about the past, the future."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "And just receiving the present moment, this changing, very dynamic present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "So what's obvious in this moment? Often at the beginning of a sitting, it is something physical, either some body sensation or sound that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "And if that is what is true for you, that's fine to connect with a particular area of experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Or if you are choosing to direct the attention to a particular area of experience like the breath, there's a way that you can aim at the breath and then receive."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Free of all the burdens and weight challenges the person's had."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "What do you pick up that has no weight? So the person kept walking now without the sack."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And after a while came across an old person who was struggling under the weight of bringing groceries home."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And was surprised by the kind of lightness that was there."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "One is the burden of pleasure and comfort."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Some people are quite attached to these things."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Some people feel that their life is only successful if they have pleasure and comfort."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So I came back and kind of wanted to get a new phone."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I was so happy that I didn't have to live under a lock and key and guards for all my possessions."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Here I can live out in the woods."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "It shouldn't be underestimated how important it is."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "That was really a good place to be."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Other people should treat me a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And sometimes those beliefs are a burden and a weight."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "One of the things I discovered was I had this belief, I saw it in a retreat, and I think it had something to do with kind of how I was thinking about the other people on the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And one of the ways of understanding this in the language of ancient Buddhism, what I'm translating is obligations and duties, is also could be understood as morality and religious observances."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "We can't do something else."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Now, there's people who work for square."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And so my mind was lighter, was easier."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I don't know if it can be done with a sense of pleasure, attachment to pleasure, but it could certainly be done as obligation and duty and all these things, the weight of it."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And the world that my vision was really remarkable."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I never had experience of my vision feeling."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And then that all disappeared."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Just felt so wonderful and delighted and it felt like, you know, play almost."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So I was kind of pouring in, remembering everything that only had to be remembered for 24 hours."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radiating Metta for All Beings", "completion": "So just different ways, and that reminds me of my grandma had a, there is a blessing in Azari Turkish, where she would go through people who were born on the days of the week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, she would go through them also, it's just different ways, right? All beings who were born on this day, all these, but you kind of ways to include everyone, right? But different ways to divide, so that's one way."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radiating Metta for All Beings", "completion": "Which you're welcome, by the way, to talk on forgiveness and self-requiem."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Conviction, virtue, shame, compunction, learning, generosity, and wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "When you have conviction in that principle, it's important in two ways."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "That you do have these potentials within the mind that you can develop that will carry you on."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And you want to make sure that in causing harm like this you know what happens."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "If you've done harm to other people, you know that you intentionally did something and it harms somebody else or it harmed yourself."}

{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "No killing, no circumstances."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "You have to go through it."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "The other three qualities are developing positive qualities in mind."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "That's what the teachings are all about."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "One is through listening, the other is through thinking."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Considering all of the current storms and hurricanes around which are swirling around us and the difficulty of practicing certain parts of what you were talking about, especially right speech, right livelihood, and considering the prominent people today who are indeed doing battle with each other, do you think that it is even possible for someone who really wishes to practice the Buddhist way and wishes to adhere to that kind of ethics, some of the things you were talking about today, can really engage in what we now know as our political arena without being absolutely contradicted by all the things that they would be forced to do and say."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And this is not just kind of an accident, there have been a group of people who really say if we can get Americans not talking to each other but screaming at each other, we can take over because there's no room for rational discourse."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "This is not a sign of being qualified to lead."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "He got those ideas out there in the society and then 200 years later you get King Ashoka."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "So it may take a amount of time, but as long as you're willing to invest time then it can happen."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "So instead he goes down and visits the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But it's also, you know, the times when you're most tempted to break the precepts are not when you're feeling a lot of love for somebody else or concern for somebody else."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Is there? The middle way is not halfway between not drinking and drinking a lot."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "So it's all or nothing for those."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "He says you look for what's appropriate that I know at a given time."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "It's going to take a long time to dig them up and it takes a lot of energy."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "It's not running a little bit and stopping."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "I don't know how to put this clearly but if you could speak about trying to navigate between not feeling you have a secure base to operate from navigating the world and to the concept that there being no self."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "He taught a not self teaching."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "You look at wherever you're clinging to something, and if you see that you're identifying with something that's going to cause suffering, you drop that identification."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Until you've totally eliminated all the things that you could be holding on to that would cause suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "In fact, I was going to get into this tomorrow night, the whole issue of Buddha nature."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "There's skillful ways of selfing and unskillful ways of selfing."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So we've been exploring the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But again just a little bit of context of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta, and the Fourth, the Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The second foundation, the foundation of feeling tone of whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, begins to move into a subtler realm of experience."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We cut ourselves with the knife or we fall down and bruise our knee."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The exploration of awareness of being concentrated or not concentrated."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We can look at the Satipatanasuta in that way."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So the last Dharma perspective offered in the in the fourth foundation is the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That is the way it's kind of framed in the first discourse, the famous first discourse of the setting of the wheel of the Dharma in motion."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We do need to understand that."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It includes the the five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "This this is feeling or perception, this is the arising of feeling or perception, this is the ending of feeling or perception, this is the way leading to the ending of feeling or perception."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It is stuck, it's in a sticky ball of a mess."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "This phrase, the phrase of the second noble truth, the origin or the arising, the word in Pali is samudaya."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So the origin of or the cause of sometimes that word samudaya is translated in that way."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We understand that it's dukkha."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because it is impermanent, there's nothing in our experience that lasts, actually nothing that lasts for more than a split second."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Let's see if I can pull it up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And there is suffering that leads to the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Of course, we're impacted because our heart opens up to compassion when there is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Maybe this is not visual, maybe it's a feeling, that you're being held in the energy of compassion by them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "They love, care, hold, all that you are, the ten thousand joys, the ten thousand sorrows."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "For others for yourself, there is care, warmth."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "The world is the veil of compassion making."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And if there is any judgment arising, I can't do this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "What it was, what it wasn't, let it be held with care, with compassion, with appreciation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Thank you for that practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And I was, I just felt that like she's just like so rooted in, you know, the present moment of, you know, just the wholeness of everything or, you know, the non, what do you call it, the emptiness side of things."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Thank you for bringing that in and the embodiment, the ease also that you felt in her listening joyfully."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And in a moment, I will open them."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Or just a more volume there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "It might be a good time to look at what is the attitude with which we're practicing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And so they're just having thoughts, maybe it's a hot day, it's seemingly innocent enough thought to have these thoughts about ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And so we're blinded by the background that's kind of building those particular thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "They're so normal we don't see them at all."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "It is not uncommon to find people translate these positive words like kindness, compassion and letting go for the right intention, right attitude."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And then you see, right? So it is the same thing with the mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "We are not an automatic pilot, you know, that we are always showing up the same way because we have this personality, you know, this character temperament that has been built in from attitudes."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Who's seeing it accurately? Who's seeing it as it really is? You know, if you look at a star, we see it as it really is, the best we can say, we see it as it really was."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Long before you were born."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "So if I had that next to me, you'd see it as it really is, you'd see it as my spatoon."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "It's not meant to see the true physical nature of things."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Doesn't mean that's just what we always wanted, but without we don't have a strong feeling that things have to be differently."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "That feeling of dissatisfaction, contentment is when that has been quieted and maybe even gone away."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "But we can't be influential with our perspective."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Again, I'm not saying that there aren't difficulties or that there aren't injustices or things like this, but this precise moment, as I said in the Guide to Meditation, I'm breathing."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "I have enough food in my belly."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "If we're under the enchantment of craving, then that, which, let's be honest, is pretty common for many of us to have this feeling like, oh, I just need this and I need that."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "In fact, some evolutionary biologists would say that, you know, evolutionarily speaking, it has some benefits in terms of that those people that were looking for better conditions, better food, better protection from danger, are the ones that survived and passed on their genes."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So I don't want us to feel like, okay, if there's this feeling like I need something more, is a failure."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "But instead I'm inviting the opportunity or the reflection for us to apply a little bit of mindfulness, some attention, some awareness to that experience."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "We need all three to find the greatest peace and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So in some ways we might see how this contentment can be a real foundational practice for ethics."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "But a sense of contentment is more about bringing the attention back here to the present moment and to see what's truly lacking in this moment, in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So rather than being lost in thoughts about what others have, or what we used to have, or what we want to have, practicing with contentment, having familiarity with that helps us to be here in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So contentment in this way supports happiness which supports concentration, as well as supporting concentration directly."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "When is it time to take actions, to make adjustments, to make changes? And when is it time to cultivate contentment? So without cultivating being a malcontent."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Buddhism Part 1: The Story of the Buddha", "completion": "So was he human? And well, it's, you know, well, of course he was human, but he's kind of like a little bit amorphous, a little bit not, he's not quite there in the way we expect from a human being in terms of a definition."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Strong Back, Soft Front", "completion": "Equanimity, support, stability."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And we're too important, to care for ourselves and our well-being and our happiness is so important that we are more important, we're so important that we don't want to hold on to the self and cling to the self because it diminishes us, it limits us."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "The third aspect of practice is using our attention to be in the present moment in some higher quality way than usual, to be in the present moment so we're not caught up in our thoughts, or caught up in self preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "Now in certain situations like in meditation or certain activities where we can give ourselves fully, mindfully over to the activity, there can be a delightful sense of forgetting the self."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And in the middle of the game, before they're going to do the most crucial part of the sport maybe, and they suddenly start having thoughts about, am I, am I not? Why am I here? What's the purpose of my life? Are people watching? Are people appreciating me when I'm doing this? I wonder if I stand up straighter, whether people will like me even more as I play the game."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "We can kind of smile and say, there it is again."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "But that caring of ourselves comes from a different place than selfish care."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "Maybe for some of you it's actually a little bit challenging to hear me say this because maybe you've taken a long time in your life to find a very confident, strong, self-caring self that you've managed to navigate through the world."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "So I'm not sure of what I'm talking about today, how articulate I can be and how well it works for some of you and the way you understand yourself and your language."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "You would say it's some different way."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And all of you are worthy of being appreciated and loved by yourself."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And so I kind of delight in this idea that we're so important that we want to trust something else besides that small self."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And that you delight in that, you learn from that, a potential for how to live."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "But the reason I'm offering this is that every year, two or three times a year, I offer a basic intro to mindfulness class."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "A chance to kind of introduce kind of the basic practices of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And I'll give you some homework I have here and that's at the end of the day."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And I would say that this kind of introductory class works a lot better if you have a daily meditation practice at home."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And then compare what your life was like when you did it and what your life was like when you don't do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So don't watch your pots, but do watch your mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "We can have an emotion, and seemingly animals have emotions, but there's a high degree of self-awareness around having the emotions that humans are capable of."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "You can be angry, and not only can you know that you're angry, really know it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "The idea of watching a mindfulness ultimately is to help us to free the mind, to lubricate the mind or the heart, so it can flow and move and be free rather than be stuck."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And now there are scholars who are beginning to do research about how different countries locked on to the swine flu virus and how to handle it in different ways, media locked on in different things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So the unwatched mind easily locks on to things, easily freezes around things, easily gets attached to things, or easily takes in things from the environment, from the world, and then is influenced by them sometimes to our detriment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I got angry, my mind got angry, this proves I'm a lousy person."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And so in order for the watching, the watch mind to bring happiness, we have to be able to free ourselves from the way in which we start judging, reacting to what is seen there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "The mindfulness is not a vague kind of presence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "To be deliberate and clear and not caught by anything allows for the mind to come to some kind of deep rest."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And then as you exhale, you're letting go, relaxing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And then see if you can maintain a relaxed, easy going, steady flow of noticing, of acknowledging."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So now I'm curious to hear from you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Let's see if people respond to my question."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So what happened when you acknowledged that? Did you acknowledge that? I did acknowledge it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I did, it's part of the time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So what was the difference between acknowledging it versus how you were with it just before the acknowledgement? Yeah, I had a certain tension around the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I tend to more notice and let it go and try to come back to the breath without actively acknowledging, I suppose, that activity."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "See if there's some middle ground that you can find that's useful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Like, noted that, was aware of that, let's go back to the breath, aware of that, and let's go to the next thing, something more interesting."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "We want to step back so we're not caught in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And so it takes some effort initially, especially when the mental forces are quite strong, the forces of preoccupation are quite strong."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "If you'd acknowledged that clarity, what do you think would have happened to you in the city? I'm not sure."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "My guess is you'll find yourself getting, if you do this, both calmer and more alert."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I mean, the poor kid was suffering."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "No, you cannot open an account."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And there were occasional times I got impatient and wanted to do something different."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "It means when we do mindfulness practice, you don't want to only emphasize relaxation and becoming calm."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So 25 minutes, maybe it's not 30 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And again, but just simply reporting this, reflecting on and recording it, I'm hoping that it heightens your sensitivity and mindfulness and awareness without being judgmental, without being manipulative, without feeling it's right or wrong, but just kind of brings a greater sensitivity to the experience of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Would you like to ask any questions or anything about this so far? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I like to think of mindfulness as being self-correcting."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Let's see, maybe I can make it softer, more relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Joseph is one of the founding teachers of our Insight Meditation Movement here in this country."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "The impact everything has on them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "And so even in a conversation with other people, is your most of your attention in the other person, paying attention to the other person as if you're supposed to, or as if that's where the danger is and you better really pay careful attention to know what's really going on? Or is your attention primarily in yourself? Me and myself and mine, I have opinions and I can't believe what this person is saying."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "It's also an opportunity, when you're trying to be with the breath and you can't be with it, it's a golden opportunity to be critical of yourself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "I keep having those kinds of concerns."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "And I'll say, wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "So we come into IMC, and rather than choosing that country where it's all about pleasure, or that cross the border into it's all about making myself safe, maybe there's no choice made at all about what you focus on when you walk in, but rather you focus on just looking around."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Now you're choosing to focus on that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Awareness can be like open space."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "So anyway, we're here together and I want to talk about taking the backward ethical step."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "It is supposed to liberate."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And so the question for today, the question for this time, question that's rumbling in my own heart is how do we become better people, ethically speaking? How do we become better? And it feels like the world is begging, begging for us to evolve."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Najin Cha famously said that Sila Samadhi Panya, ethical conduct, mind training, and wisdom are all the same fruit."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "You'll notice these two guardians, Herei and Ottapa, are about avoiding harmful action."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Sometimes if you move carefully through the forest breathing like the ones in the old stories, who could cross a shimmering bed of leaves without a sound, you come to a place whose only task is to trouble you with tiny but frightening requests, conceived out of nowhere, but in this place beginning to lead everywhere, requests to stop what you're doing right now, and to stop what you're becoming while doing it."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And however deeply activist we are in our lives, a lot of the trace of a life is just in the very simple relationships that surround, that are our circle."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And I don't know this Zen tradition well at all."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "There's something about that phrase, the backward step that came to mind as I was reflecting about this morning, that we're being asked to take a kind of a backwards ethical step."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And there's some research in moral philosophy, neuroethics, this sort of marriage of brain science and ethical moral philosophy, moral psychology."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And on the push side are moral emotions and cognitions, ideas, and then pulling away from this process of moralization is hedonism and dissonance reduction strategies."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "So, and maybe I'll just, I can put the model in the chat."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "It's less about rational reflection, but ideas still count, reasoning still counts."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Yeah, that there's something unjustifiable about our ethical life."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "To practice is to become sensitive."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "We come to develop an acute sensitivity to this, to write the truth of suffering is to be comprehended."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "In my own practice, I found that to be so, all dhammas converge on feeling, so much of our path, so much of the kind of mechanisms of compulsivity, of release converge on feeling, allowing what I spoke of before we sat, allowing the tightly bound wire of our own feeling to unfurl and to follow it into the place where it terminates, to follow it with wisdom, with equanimity to the place where it terminates, in love, peace, delight, compassion."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "That can have onward leading benefits, yeah? But it's complicated."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And so, we become connoisseurs of moral incoherence, of the unjustifiability of our life."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Somehow you, who are connected to that person, have to do what they can no longer do."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "So, we have to ask, what will we do in place of our friend? That's it for a minute."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And maybe he raised his eyebrows and so she asked him, who do you hold most dear? And he said, I hold myself most dear."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And the goal of practice was to realize some kind of fundamental union, communion, realization of the self that was really radically apart from the world we live in."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Then he lays out what a person should do."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "To reach the state of peace, those skilled in the good should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Their wealth is their loving kindness."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "So to be interested in creating good conditions for them."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Within sight was a great mountain forming part of the Himalayan mountain range."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "They came down from their tree homes and from a distance wandered back and forth with their children."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Filled with happiness, the devas began to support the monks and did so for the remainder of their retreat."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "So it's a nice fable, and it's a full story."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "That we would live ethically."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And the Buddha agreed with the apprentice."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Protecting others, one protects oneself."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And to do the same thing for the people around us."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "But really being encompassing it all as part of our own welfare, I think it's more necessary now in this world than ever before."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And then we get to be surprised."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Praise the dark, the moon cradle, the sky fall, the bear sleep."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "I was reading, sharing this poem, reading this poem every morning this week to my girls."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And maybe it can help in the conflicts out in the world."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "I don't want to feel this."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So maybe we could say in the language of insight meditation, saying yes is the practice of non-clinging."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Right? All the ways we say I don't want to feel this."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Anyway, we, so I think we, we deeply want to practice."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So the invitation is to get to know these, to study them."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Aversion is like, we don't like it, right? You know, so, of course, I don't want, you know, I want to, if I can only just get rid of all the, my hindrances, then I could enjoy this retreat."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So I'm kind of holding the cash in my, in my pocket and walking around and looking and see what's good, what's what do I want? You know."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "It activated the sense of self and the sense of, you know, who'd been wronged."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And, you know, it doesn't have lots of energy to, you know, watch something."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "You know, and then various times in my practice, it has been amazing to notice the creeping, the, you know, doubt is like, is a silent, comes in the night, doubt kind of tiptoes up on us."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And you know, this little whisper in the mind of, you can't do this."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "What do you think you're doing? I remember I was on a long retreat and getting into a little bit of new territory for me in the meditation, getting pretty quiet, pretty concentrated."}

{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "Okay okay okay all right okay thank you."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "Okay it's the best place to see this is going to be in the concentration but as your you reach a point sometimes where you realize so you have a choice between staying in one level of concentration and going to a deeper one and though there'll be a choice at that point it's the the advantage of doing this with in concentration is the things to get slowed down but they're more focused and once you're able to see that you know the moment where you're deciding okay I'm gonna drop this and go to something else and you can do it consciously this is why the Buddha talks about being very conscious about going from one level to another because sometimes we just slip okay and we're not paying my careful attention with them I just it settles down willy-nilly wherever it's gonna go okay okay whereas the Buddha saying if you're more conscious about the different steps then it's gonna be easier to see those steps as you as you do with regular sensory experience okay okay okay that's very helpful the second part of my question from a solid level of concentration I can see the allure and the drawbacks of the labeling the stress the subtle stress that's involved and from the drawbacks that they that the act of labeling is not worth it and beginning to experience I say beginning to experience a feeling of disenchantment with it but it feels like a huge step from moving from the disenchantment to dispassion says cessation just keep doing it okay get used to it because part of it is also that if it's when you really see the allure and you see how stupid the allure is that's when you're like oh okay okay okay okay thank you Olivia go ahead unmute yeah thank you for your talk so there was something intriguing about this concept of we're going to have the five aggregates and craving right now and so there might be some that are more skillful than others and I've been experiencing a lot of craving for meditation craving for renunciation and it seems hypocritical like it's I recognize that this process of craving and yet it's to remove craving but I wondered if you could speak a little bit more about how to discern when there is when it is this kind of a skillful motion versus the mind sort of co-opting mental state I'm craving and craving for the path is perfectly fine in other words it's it's the only way you're going to get out of your other cravings is to start craving something better and so you don't feel don't feel hypocritical about it just realize good as the word himself said all things skillful and unskillful are rooted in desire and so you want to be able to encourage this the skillful desires because you realize this is this is going to lead us something that really will be good for my long-term welfare and happiness and you what you you want to encourage that now it's only after you've started mastering some of these things that you can start saying well these things have their drawbacks as well I want something better that's when you move on so you crave the path as much as you want and don't feel hypocritical about it and then there will be some natural point where letting go of the raft or right any stage of the raft will right yeah looks like you know there's that far aside cartoon where you know the cows are standing around eating grass and one of them jerks their head up wait a minute this is grass we've been eating grass as long as grass tastes good keep on eating the grass and then somebody realize hey well this is grass and you move on thank you I don't thank you so much in the beginning you mentioned the raw material for fabrication is past actions so I kind of took it as a that's probably the fundamental level that's where the causality is but sometimes if for me to in my practice understand fabrication deliberately are there anything that you would suggest in grasping the origination of these fabrications okay in terms of your raw material you're going to be pretty much getting what you know you don't have much choice over the raw material that's being presented and so you want to look for the origination in the present moment it's okay what what is my desire right now what am I looking for how is my desire shaped by my intentions how is my desire shaped by my perceptions are my perceptions setting me so setting me up for something unskillful or kind of should I change the perceptions I mean this is one of the reasons why it's good to read in in accounting because the word it gives you so many alternative perceptions for looking at things you understand a particular situation in light of one perception say what I mean I've been holding on to this perception it has no relationship to reality or at least it's very you know it's getting it's making me do something unskillful I should change my perception around this so there's a deliberate yeah there's a deliberate intentionality there isn't right right right yeah I see Maria also can you hear me yes okay try to find you oh you see me now I'm just checking to see if something that I'm doing matches what you just taught us so one of the things that I do is I try to observe in myself if ill will or judgment some negative state mind state is coming up in me and if I notice that that's happening that's a flag to me that I have wrong view that I'm looking at the situation with a destructive point of view and so that flag is a it's a flag to me that feeling of hostility or negativity towards the person or anger that's a flag to me that I have the wrong point of view and I need to raise my level of consciousness and and challenge my perspective on the situation to have a more objective compassionate point of view and when I can do that then I can recognize what would be a better point of view to see this situation from and it helps helps me let go of the anger and the hostility right now what you're trying to describe the right right yeah that my view is what's creating the perception so I have to change the perception by choosing a different point of view right and you can you can play with the different perceptions or different thought fabrications you think think of it in terms of fabrication what would be a good perception what would be a good line of thought around this I know some people say well this doesn't the same so artificial I said well the whole process of fabrication is artificial to begin with it's just that some fabrications are more habitual they seem more natural as a result but we can step back and come up with new ways of fabricating around the situation that are just as true and actually more beneficial so the way that I look at that is that my point of view is often very self-absorbed and a small and myopic and just my personal Maria Balsamo point of view and when I recognize this is happening within me I can ask myself the question what would a wiser more objective divine being how would they see this situation I asked myself that question I often get a different answer than my point of view and I try to adopt their point of view like what would the Buddha think of this how the Buddha might see the other person perhaps that person is the politician they know more about that politician than than I do they might know more about the state of what they know than I do so that helps me recognize that my point of view is so narrow and small and then I try to get a broader point of view a more objective wiser point of view yeah yeah here this is where it's helpful the Buddha has a concept because we call safeguarding the truth where you ask us I mean these things that I believe on the basis of what do I believe them you know if there's hearsay reports I mean most most of the internet is 99% hearsay you hear something and if and it fits with a view that you already have again that's not necessarily proof that it's true there's an analogy that that seems to make sense to you again that's not proof so you realize a lot of the things that I that I really believe are true I may not have a really solid foundation for that so it helps to sort of pry you loose a little bit to begin with and secondly you're saying if an arhat we're looking at this situation the arhat would not be suffering so I have seen not looking at the sit with the same eyes as an arhat how would an arhat look at this and that and then you're so good there must be a way to be in this situation and not suffer I say Jeff and Arita morning John I'd like to clarify for myself just what you've said and the other participants have been saying I'll start with you this comment if you don't question that you're eating grass you're going to continue to eat grass right right so would it be safe to say if we're following the Buddha's path and we're feeling some kind of stress we're still eating some grass that's the starting point yeah and then so from the point where I am to at least stream enter I need to be evaluating then what are my perceptions how are my perceptions continually putting me in this suffering and so it was my question so where is the focal point of any moment where's the compass of that directional that this is causing me suffering like I don't know stream entry yet so I need to to navigate through it's still me doing the fabricating yeah so I somehow have an evaluation that this would be better you know X would be better than Y or Y would be better than X so without getting caught up in the the overall identity that's me how am I knowing that I'm heading in the direction of this is a better choice you know why is a better choice than X versus I'm just circulating through my identity well you have to ask yourself in which what state of mind would would inspire you to take one choice over another if you can clearly see that there's it would be anger or it would be lust or some unskillful mental state that would incline you to choose X over Y it's okay I better I better avoid X now if you can't see any distention between the two then you basically flip a coin and then try it out try out one of the others and see what the results will be so presumably I'm you know generosity is solid virtuous solid I'm meditating so then the choices through the day would would then become which do I think would be an even more skillful and beneficial course of action right right really subtle I'm gonna go read some down more I'm gonna meditate a bit more something like that so then another question with that is you mentioned that the Buddha the Buddha said if you're defining yourself you're limiting yourself is he speaking of limiting ourselves is another form of identity that's we'll get us into the be the craving becoming cycle is he asking us to see where where we can step out of those identities but to what like or or where are how to know a more subtle limiting identity versus a course that one it's kind of plays into how do I know that that I am headed in the direct you know the correct direction I've been traveling a while it seems pretty good but nothing's really I'm not seeing any subtler shifts okay with the Buddha wants you to focus more on your actions and on the question of identity just put the question of identity aside as much as possible the only identity that you need in order to practice is the identity one that I am capable of doing this too I'm the one who's responsible for my choices I'm responsible I'm capable and yes I do want a higher level of happiness I want a more secure level of happiness that's those are the only aspects of identity that you that he really recommends and anything beyond that he's just just don't think and don't think thing in terms of question of your identity yes so much as well this course of action that I want to do what are the results going to be focus more and more on your actions than on your sense of energy on your sense of who Jeff is you might look at that article that just came out on Dhamma talks is called clinging on the end of clinging okay yeah yeah I mean which which talks about how the Buddha of the various forms of clinging the Buddha's has no cling to habits and practices just cling to skillful habits cling to skillful practices as your main as your main source of clinging as you're on the path there was another question but I'm going to set it up okay fine apology tana John so the next thing that I'm asking about is fabrication in the context of the second noble truth you did mention that this is fabrication occurs in three contexts sort of first noble truth I asked earlier but I'm now thinking in context of the second noble truth again normally the way I think is okay what kind of cravings do I have are these sensual cravings or are these cravings for taking on an identity but I'm not very sure if it is even necessary for me to divide it up because the Buddha does say one should know the diversity in in fabrication so I'm kind of wondering how I would even think about the diversity in fabrication in the context of second noble truth or do I even need to do that okay here you're more you're more interested again in the question of what is a skillful desire as opposed to what is an unskillful desire okay okay okay so so skillful desire to meditate to maybe do walking meditation that's a skillful desire but to do say something else that may be very wrong to do maybe like killing or something that kind of thing is an unskillful desire okay and in terms of the fourth noble truth I think I understand that the whole path is a fabrication right but the question there that I had is of those it seems like the verbal fabrication seems to be coming first if I'm not wrong instead of bodily fabrication it seems like the verbal because the Buddha seems to put right speech first and also in terms of concentration the first thing that comes is directed thought and evaluation so it seems that verbal fabrication comes first and then the other things follow along is that right yeah I mean right view is basically for a verbal fabrication right result is a verbal fabrication okay okay thank you Pradeep thank you thank you for offering this very much appreciated my question is regarding the element of subjective value value judgment that you spoke of and the element of the time slowing down and I'm trying to understand if the deeper one is going in one's concentration practice is it a sensible way to think of this as the deeper you are in concentration the quicker and more deeply in your mind you are able to learn and cultivate a specific way of fabricating a particular state that you want to cultivate be that love or beauty or compassion and the reason why I'm asking this is let us say that one is in the context in in the wider life where it's harder to access a skillful state of fabrication then it is it probably better to not practice a lot of concentration in the first place because you might be wiring yourself in a more unskillful way is that okay my attitude generally is except for people who are psychotic more more more concentration is better okay because you're you're getting quicker at seeing things are going on in the mind you know sometimes you hear that people say that you know they've done studies that show that the mind the brain has made a decision before you're consciously aware of the fact that the decision has been made and that that's the argument that you know that basically that the brain is kind of a slower part slower brain is faster than you are basically and I found that when you do concentration practice you were actually speeding up your ability to see when those decisions are being made and that's that's all to the good because you want to you want to catch those decisions while they're being made rather than after the fact yeah okay that makes that makes sense I guess the clearer you get the quicker your subjective value judgments would catch any any wrong direction that you were going in and then right just shortens the feedback loop okay super helpful thank you cuz there's a there's a tendency of the mind to make a decision then pretend it didn't make it yeah we had it we had a dog back in the monastery in Thailand who in the evening would when the monks were having the things that are allowable for monks to eat would come and sit at you sit at our feet and and if we if we didn't offer anything to it it was scratch scratch your leg and then you look down and it would look away pretend pretend that it hadn't scratched your leg and I saw my them that's the human mind is so much like that beautiful thank you Pritvi during the day can you hear me sorry during the day when you some of your actions are when one of your actions is appreciated or you notice that others like I'm finding it keep coming to your awareness during later in the day how to handle this one or is it when you're acting itself we have to look care look further you're looking for any appreciation and cut there or is there any way you can control that one okay you have to be able to see these things in real time as much as you can so that you can catch yourself you know when what your reaction is what your reasoning is before a particular for a particular action and the more quickly you can see that the more you understand okay this is why I chose that action when it went away it was not my best interest and you can check and then you understand it a lot more easily because if you try to go back and reconstruct the event again your your your perceptions may be getting in the way your self-image may be getting in the way there are lots of things that prevent you from actually seeing it in you know as it actually was so you want to see it in real time as much as you can and how to not get take pride from it when you keep acting skillfully or when people appreciate and don't get pride from it how to do that because you said you could you ask the question again I couldn't quite hear you if people appreciate then automatically the pride is coming and how to stop that pride coming ah we have to ask yourself these people they're praising me what do they want out of me that was always a John Fuen's message just watch out for the people who are praising you they want something out of you thank you I don't see more blue hands I'm just curious if there's anyone who is raising your physical hand in zoom and you can do that too there's a blue hand okay so much Michelle please go ahead you can unmute okay thank you that's my son's name that's confusing he has so many zoom classes my question is a lot of my suffer I feel it's from one is from desire and some is from compassion for example I have a very difficult diagnosed that I'm trying to control my emotion I might not live long and I'll show my son is five-year-old so I was trying to think oh maybe it's a good thing for him right so as a young age that was good big challenge so I'm trying to like get away from this maybe a fabricated truth that being a good parent means with him you see what I'm getting at so you can speak more so please okay okay this is where you have to tell yourself that it's not necessarily the number of years you're with him it's the quality of the instruction and quality of the training you give him and so you want to make sure that you embody good values and you teach them good values and you'll be able to remember that so you know however much time you have I mean in some ways you're lucky that you realize the time is limited so you got you have the impetus to want to make make the most of it to teach them good values about being an honest person being a good person you're trusting in his trusting in his best intentions and always doing it always doing you know what trying to always do the skillful thing and noise develop goodwill and compassion for others then if it turns out that you know that the diagnosis is correct that you don't have that much time with him you know that's that's that would be his memory of you that the good things that you taught him because I mean and speaking in terms of that you know the number of years that's the best that any parent can do for a child any of this is good values to the child so it's suffering okay when it's coming from compassion I think a compassion that's like I think I appreciate my parent were being able to be with me while grow up so I felt sad that he might not like aside my own decide of being a good parent to be with someone and also on the other side is thinking oh he will visit I feel sad because of compassion right so yeah I don't know like the compassion cause suffer but so this is the suffer good like and it's the clinging you know I cling to live that's why I try to take care of myself better so it is kind of craving good if I don't cling I don't you like if I feel oh this is fine he's gonna be fine and you know it's a good challenge for him anyway and then I feel this sort of become cold like you know so this everything's very conflicted in my case in this case that breaks perfect sense that you should do what you can and only stay alive as long as you can but isn't the main point of Buddhist teaching at least in the tradition that I was surrounded was in in China is to like don't don't cling for life right like life is all emptiness you know like these are these whole things fake you know it's not fake I mean the suffering is gonna be real yeah you should tell us okay I want to make the most of my relationship with my son and so you know whatever I can do we know within the realms of what's for its virtuous I'm willing to do that in order to stay alive to help the son but you're also have to have part of the mind it says okay if it happens I have to go I have to learn how to be okay with that too this is when the Buddha teaches the Brahma for hearts it's not just equanimity there's good will compassion empathetic joy equanimity you develop all four you don't say well equanimity is the highest so I'll just go for the highest you have to have all four so you've got good will for your son you've got compassion for your son you're happy to see him happy to see him happy but then there's equanimity that this is what every parent has to develop whether without a diagnosis like yours which is okay that there will come a time when we have to part ways and at that way if the time comes I have to be okay with that you know otherwise you're gonna start just hovering around your son after you die right yep that's very helpful and we had a there was a woman student of my teacher after after my teacher died she she had raised two sons after the second son was born the husband left her so she had to raise the sons alone and the first son was bright athletic personable good-looking you know the ideal son and the second son was kind of dumpy and you know born your guy and it was the first son who was killed got a motorcycle accident one time and and it was killed within 10 minutes after he left the house and she started having a sense that the son was still hanging around the house little signs here and there and so she came to me one time she said kind of keep the body at the monastery because there's a belief in Thailand as long as the body has not been cremated the spirit has that's kind of a locus and the spirit will still hang around I said please let the boy go it's a miserable life to be hanging around like this and so she finally agreed to have the cremation and then that was the end of the signs that the spirit was still hanging around so when the time comes to go he said okay I've got to go there it says no there's something better for me to do and learn how to be okay with that but in the meantime you know for out of good will and compassion for your son you know get whatever medical treatment you need that you think that will that would be helpful should I prepare my son to like how do I like yeah I don't know should I prepare my son to get ready for this well to whatever extent you feel that the diagnosis is true yes you should let the son know that your mommy may not be around all the time but these are things mommy wants you to understand to hold on to even when mommy's not around okay any last questions before we stop for the stop the morning session yes Tom John you have a question regarding the simile of the archer wonder if you could clarify something the straw mound the straw man or mound of clay is that the first John I'm being able to see and constantly stress and the first time what is the straw man so that you can go on and hire John is it's unclear to me okay the straw man is not the important part it's the skill is not firing firing rapid shots counted accurately accurately and also doing in quick succession and piercing great masses that's the important part okay so then then you can go on and use that and your concentration right that ability okay right that would be something like that thank you Michael thank you I just wanted to share one of the models that works for me very well in my meditation practice over the course of the years has been particularly when examining talking about fabrications and understanding them is because we're all inculcated and you know there are so many so social cultural ways that we have been mentally constructed the house actually as a model works for me during my meditation to actually be able to see exactly how my mental confabulations are actually put together and it's a good it's a house basically and I look at the construction of the house and see whether or not when I am able to identify the pieces that actually construct the house whether they're actually well constructed or not and if they're not then I remove them and I wind up disassembling the house that I originally got to perceive and construct something that's much more valuable and equanimous okay thank you okay one last question all right hi Tenogen hi oh I had a bit of a fall on like being a parent and kids and being attached to your kids your friends or teachers or whoever does that make it it seems like there's so much suffering that like you can't help it like it just happens but there's there's so much pain that like the one is saying that suffering comes from those who are dear it's really really true right right well this is this is this is my equanimity is the hardest thing for parents to develop and also the most necessary I know and it doesn't get easier as the kids get older I know I know 80 year old people we know with 40 50 year old children and they still you know it's they still see the child as it was that that little lump that was first born yeah we can't quite hear you Bob I should put a headset on now we can hear you though it's hard it's hard to work on but something that's really necessary to work on and then you think like in this life I'm a parent but maybe I wasn't before or maybe the next life not well you've been parent I don't know how many times yeah we've been all of it right right but yeah like certain people like you know you say like my daughter is asking me like you know why is the board you know was a born here I'm like you chose to be born here you know the best of it yeah it seems like monks can be so free they can go off as people practicing they just let go of those connections and focus on their practice but other of us are okay well just just just work on it realizing that every relationship is gonna have to end at some point and so in the meantime what good can you give the other person so that their memory of your relationship will be a good memory and it will have had a good long-term effect on them right that's the best thing that's the best thing yeah okay well break for a couple hours we'll meet back here at two o'clock our time and we'll see you in the next video."}

{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "It might not be possible to live a life with no fear, some fear is realistic, but certainly without anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "The decisions for the stories we tell, or the ways in which we relate to other people."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "What if we know how to be afraid, we know how to be present for it, know how to recognize it clearly and understand it's there and not deny it, but are able to breathe through it, or have a wider field of attention that holds it, and gives us the freedom to come and behave based on other intentions, other motivations, other purposes for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "Is Wikipedia less accurate than what's in the newspapers? I kind of suspect that it's more carefully curated than the newspapers, and less kind of has a particular political twist or something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "There's a connection with it, and sometimes that sense of meaning we have animates and activates our meditation, like search for meaning, staying close to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Sometimes it agitates it, sometimes it gets caught up in these topics of meaning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Some people mistrust meaning making and don't see a need for it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "But that also is connected to meaning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Then we can ask the question, how does my meditation support what's most important for me? And it's possible that if meditation doesn't support what's most important, maybe you shouldn't meditate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And if fear is motivating it, then the practice of mindfulness is to turn the attention around to really attend to the fear before we attend to the big questions, and really go deeply into it and be present until that fear dissolves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And when the fear dissolves, then what has happened to those questions? If those questions are big questions or the big kind of meanings of life are not fueled by fear, what fuels them? Or if they're not fueled, what happens to them? Does our relationship to them change? The beliefs might still be there, but if they don't have the strength that comes with the power that comes from the fear, what happens to it then? The same thing with death."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "The big existential conclusions we've come to, they're important to see."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, what we'll be turning towards today will be basically two pronged."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "One is sense of stability in the body, because when we are stable, when we are grounded, when we have a sense of embodiment, when we're connected to our bodies, there can be a lot more sense of stability and resilience."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Imagine if you are a pop-up doll, if you've seen these dolls that have sand in the bottom, and if somebody hits them, they fall over, and then there's a sand on the bottom."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, first, building the foundation."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And as you are sitting, as if you were touching the earth with your hand, with your body, instilled with a sense of stability, groundedness, integrity, supported."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Being loving with some dis-ease in the chest."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Because when they're kind of in the head, they feel more tight, but in the receiving them in the lower body, it offers them kind of more space, more groundedness."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Sometimes it's hard to put these into words, but if you didn't experiment with it, I definitely welcome you to experiment with that."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And I'll offer a couple of images for you to work with."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "As thoughts arise again, feel your body, feel your body."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Because as you're moving around later in your life, listening to the news, hopefully not too much of it, titrating what's the amount that's helpful."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So let's take the 20 minutes, which is now become shorter."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And your body as an organ of perception, a gentle kind, loving organ of perception, perceiving the sensations, perceiving, receiving the breath, receiving thoughts and emotions, the sense of benevolence, not getting reactive, there's plenty of space."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Appreciative, gentle, receiving the sensations, the breath and sounds."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Expanding, just as you are embodied, expanding the range of what's received, appreciatively kindly, sensations inside, sounds inside, sounds outside."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "For your practice for having shown up again and again as much as was available, appreciation and mentor."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "We layered that on top of the first part that we had built, which is the embodiment, body as a sense, sense organ, as an organ of perception."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And for me, the inner smile kind of became inner jubilation after it was applied to all the phenomena we see."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, the same way that a mother, for example, the archetype of a mother or grandmother, as I was suggesting during the meditation, if there is pain, if the child is hurting and pain, the mother doesn't frown and say, oh, you're in pain."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, Violet, that's what I would invite for the parts of the body and mind that are truly painful."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Yeah, which can be a sense of netta, the care, meeting the sadness."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "There's a sense of sweetness in community and practicing together, both our own practice and practice."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And we'll have some time at the very end to share in community, to share our practice."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So I am letting some time because that can bring so much sweetness of us being together with our practice."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "I'm loving the wisdom of the community."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Bill offers some difficulty in imagining a grandmother mother figure that works for me."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Then offering this, the sense of friendliness, openness to experience, again, as you're walking, as your foot touches the earth, greeting that, opening up to that with a sense of metta, friendliness, appreciation for the sensations, for the experience."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "If you're making yourself a cup of tea, can you meet the experience with a sense of friendliness, safety, metta, offering metta, which in the way actually it's offered to you."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Yeah, let's do this one for 15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "But that alone can bring a sense of stability."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "It's a way to support and forfeit and bring more resilience so that we can be of service to other people, be of service to Mother Earth."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So with that, I would like to invite us as, actually, still with your eyes open for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And as I was suggesting early, as if the Buddha has just entered your body to say, hey, I'm going to show you how, how, how this is done."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "The cup that holds your tea, the chair that offers you cushioning, the technology that offers you to be connected while at home."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And letting your heart, feeling embodied, letting your heart, heart center open up to receive, to receive all the goodness in your life."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "In whatever ways that you can available with others."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And if we get, we get lost in rumination and thinking, we get lost in rumination and thought, we get lost in rumination and thought, we get lost in rumination and thought, we get lost in rumination."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Be lifted up by the beauty of this aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And bring them close, bring them close, bring them close."}

{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So what we'll do now, I'd like to invite you, is we'll get into small groups and share whatever arises."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So there is so much rich wisdom in this community."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": ", then of course that's understood."}

{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "If somebody would like to get us started with your reflections with what's come up today, what have you realized? Or what happened in the group? You can also give a report from a group sharing."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "One time, you just, you do it one time, one day, and then you're set for life."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "This is the time to go maybe listen to something from audio dharma and just sit."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And there is a beauty and grace in doing that, in seeing the interconnection as we feed ourselves every day."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "In fact, it's actually kind of wonderful that we don't get inoculated when we do the practice once and they were done for life."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Anyway, Buddhism using soul is kind of funky, but I'm using it as a soulful, as a soulful way of relating to life, relating to others with beauty, with grace, with love."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It's all just this changing flow of unfolding conditions, processes that work."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "We've talked about various analogies of that, the analogy of the river, for instance, the rainbow is actually the one I like the most in a way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And it was enough that it would happen, like I could stand in the same spot and sometimes I would watch the mist kind of float through and see if the rainbow was appearing here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It looked like the rainbow was sitting there just like in the curtains were being parted in a way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It was appearing in exactly the same place as long as I was standing in the same place."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It was appearing in the same place."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It needs the observer, it needs the sun, and it needs the water in the atmosphere."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "Any one of those three conditions not there, the rainbow won't be seen."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And often I think sometimes we have various patterns or habits that result in familiar contractions, familiar senses of experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And it's just, you know, it's like, it's kind of feel like that pattern or habit is waiting somewhere, that it's always there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And so the instructions for practicing, there are instructions for practicing around this topic of not self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It's a 12-step series series of conditions and kind of patterns that tend to arise when our mind is caught by views and beliefs caught by greed aversion delusion and it is a description of how suffering comes to be."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "So this this is actually the teaching of dependent origination gives us a sense of what is available to be observed in experience when there is suffering happening when there's a sense of self happening and so this is this is really how do we study a sense of self when we're studying a sense of self we're studying this chain of dependent origination we're studying this process of of conditions unfolding and another piece that feels useful to me because the single process the single teaching of dependent origination both describes how suffering comes to be and how the sense of self comes to be the kind of the attachment of the belief in the sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "How are you right now? How is the body? What is the tone, the emotional tone, the feeling? It may be similar to the way it was at the beginning, or it may have shifted a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Not needing to fix anything or make anything any different."}

{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox, or a ox cart, follows the ox."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So sometimes the words pure and evil can be a little bit problematic."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Then when we start to practice meditation, then we begin to see the noise of our mind, all the things that are going on in there, all of the voices of our conditioning, that might be quite critical sometimes, unaccepting or judgmental."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So, there has to be a different approach."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And it's a big mess, it's going to take a long time to sort it out, and we wish, oh, I did that again, and I really wanted to practice right speech, and I really wish I hadn't done that, but it was just too much."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "I couldn't help it, and, you know, so that it might be that we can catch it there when it's already happened, and then rather than covering it up or blaming ourselves, then the path is to turn towards the feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And then when we feel it, we just want to, we want to move with it, we want to respond to it."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And when I say mind, I'm pointing to my heart when I say that because it kind of begins here in the heart, mind, in the chitta."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "A feeling that arises, an urge, a pull or a yearning or a push."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Was I angry this morning? No, I wasn't."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And probably when you're fully enlightened, it is like that."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And I've got a nice seat here."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And just recognizing that here we all are in this space."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "If we're sitting at home, maybe you can sit for like 10 minutes, 15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "The truck that it was traveled in was made by people."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So that's connected with other people."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "It's kind of remarkable when you start to really look."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "When I'm completely interconnected with all things, what do I want? What do I want to push away? It's all part of me, the beautiful and the ugly, the destructive, the creative."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And then we can feel the feeling of anger and know that this is a shared experience."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Just before I went to live in the monastery, which is quite a few years ago now, I had a really good reminder of this because I was always quite conscientious about the environment and pollution and so on."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And there's a sort of, well, I'll use an engineering term feedback time in which you start to do something and probably, as you say, you may go right through it."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "She was just a very loving human being."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Because there's a lot of energy builds up with anger."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Because you can't always hold it together, you know, it builds up."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "I don't know if you have anything."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "But I mean, it's a very difficult thing, because as you say that, I think about these enormous corporations, actually, that there is not even a person you can speak to that are doing that."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "I don't know about it actually."}

{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "We get lost and we come back."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And hopefully, or maybe hopefully, there's a way that these come together, that these come together in us."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And this is a line from a text called Genjokoan."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And Genjokoan is, I think, considered the summation of Zen practice from a certain style of Zen practice called sotozen."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And so it implies a knowing, implies a closeness."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "We're studying the self, we're practicing the self, we're becoming intimate with the self."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "So that's the first kind of intimacy."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "To study the self, to so thoroughly study ourselves, know ourselves, become intimate with ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "It's all us, it's all inside us, it's all included."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "But a view is also used in English to mean a belief or an opinion or an orientation a person has towards something, a belief."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "So it's not really a foreign idea."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "If we find ourselves spontaneously behind our friends back praising their good qualities, then we might have a nicer feeling inside."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And I recognized in a way I had never done before that I had a lot more choice about how I act and what I say."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "It's more like a principle."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And coincidentally, the place where the doors are open, where there's ease and relaxation, openness, happiness tends to be in the direction of goodness."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And you might see over the next 24 hours, before we come back tomorrow, and I teach about the liberating right view, you might kind of tune into your choices in what you say and what you do."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And if there can be that sense of allowing, just that recognition, oh, this is how it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "As we can scan through our body and let go of tension, just noticing where there might be a holding and allowing a relax or release of tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And some of you may find it more useful to choose some particular experience like the breath and let the attention rest with that, narrowing the field of what we're paying attention to, but still seeing if there can be a receiving of that."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "This is just as a practitioner or a person, you know, how safe are we for others? And what's the process by which we become really safe? Now there's a sense that perhaps at some point we can stop this process of letting the Dharma kind of stop, we could say, stop looking for places for the Dharma to soak into."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And so tonight I want to, that is a kind of preamble, talk about secrets, secrets actually, secrets and freedom, transparency."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "So, secrets, this is something, you could say that maybe we think about secrets as something that we hide from others, but the status of secrets within ourselves is that they're partially obscured from ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We almost always have very negative associations with the word shame and I'm not even sure this is, shame is the best word for this, but this is like, this is one of the guardians of the world, or hiri and otapa, so this is the Buddha, there are two bright qualities that safeguard the world, which two, hiri and otapa, are the guardians and concern for the results of unskillful actions."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And so we sort of overestimate the meaning of one mind moment."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "It's like oxygen to begin to sort of like air out these corners of the mind or corners of our history."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We really need a very radical, we need the audience and that audience in this case is our own mind."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "You know, and to be in a community and space where we're actually really open about what it's like to be alive."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And when a community can be really open to what it's like and share openly about that, we can start to sense just how much we share with other people."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "So I really, I would, I would keep, keep following that, that thread."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "It'll, it, it'll have it, it'll have its time."}

{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "But then you have to turn around and look at the fact that your concentration, the activity of insight itself, is something that's fabricated that too has to be let go."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "As for abandoning, that relates to the duty with the second noble truth, which is craving, you have to let it go."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "That's a very radical proposition the Buddha is giving us right there."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "You're simply seeing an image with the eye."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "We'll use them to develop dispassion for fabrication in the first and second noble truth, and then ultimately, after we develop the fourth noble truth, we have to use them to develop dispassion for our concentration and insight."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Every case he says where the mind suffers is going to be an instance of clinging aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "As I said, these are related to clinging, and the word for clinging is related to feeding."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Next explained by what I said just now, which is that our past karma presents us with the raw material for our present experience, but it doesn't become a present experience until we fabricated it into specific aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "In other cases, something comes up, a sight appears or a sound appears, and then you develop some intentions around that sound or around that sight."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Like you might get a desire for a pizza right now."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "You say, okay, when the Zoom meeting is over, I'm going to order a pizza."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Before we move on to the topic of clinging, any more questions about craving? Ajaan, I'm kind of wondering what's the difference between sensuality craving and sensual becoming because there are the examples you gave."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And given the issue of speech, particularly say on college campuses now, I'm just interested in if you have a sense of what the Buddha might say about folks who would say that some speech is hurting my feelings, and therefore it's harmful to me."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And so he says basically before he would say anything, he'd ask himself first, is it true? And if it was true, then the second question is, is it beneficial? And the third question, is this the right time to say something pleasant or something unpleasant? So truth, beneficial, time and place."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So we have to learn how to learn that people's speech can be what they, people have the right to say what they want to say, but we don't have to let ourselves get harmed by it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And if you can learn that, then we can live with one another."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So I think that's probably what you would have to say."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Can you help me distinguish the three poisons from these three forms of craving? Are you talking about the same thing with different terms? A lot of the craving, three times the craving are what either be greed or aversion."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But I'm curious about that because in terms of an arahan not ever breaking the five precepts or something like that, and the path also having that quality of harmlessness around say the five precepts, there seems to be a correspondence and some quality to the enlightened mind that would keep it from those things."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The color of the dirt on the road to the Grand Canyon is the same color as the Grand Canyon."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The word for craving, dunha, means to thirst for something, whereas the word upadana, which is the poly word for clinging, is to feed on something."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It clings to the fuel at the same time that it's feeding on the fuel."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So if you want to learn how to be in a relationship, the Buddha actually recommends that when a monk gets ordained that he regards his teacher as his father and the teacher is supposed to regard the monk as his son and treat one another with the same kind of affection."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Okay, what are aggregates? What's clinging? Let's go into a little bit more detail."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "We think it's worth the effort to get it that we go for it and that we cling to it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So what this means is we're making a value of judgment, and the Buddha is saying we're making a very bad value of judgment in clinging to the aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Once a year I go to Zion National Park and I have to drive through Las Vegas."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And one of the billboards was saying, because you know, promising, we give a 93% payback rate."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Is it stressful or easeful? It's stressful."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Trying to prove our value judgments."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And then you cling to the food as you're eating it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Now the problem is our judgment is pretty bad."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "They wait until you're asleep at night, and then they come and package your ears and eyes and nose."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It's whatever you identify yourself as."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "As for antelopes, it just doesn't make any sense to you."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So he said, Stay away from this process of defining yourself."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Which is not what he's saying."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And this summer went by, of course, the little Gosling turned into a goose."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Of these four, three of them actually have a role in the path."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It's interesting that the Buddha also includes the belief that I have a self and I have no self."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Because it just gets you entangled in a writhing of use."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So all of these things would come in that you hold onto these things, either to argue the point, or just for your own personal belief, or the belief that by holding onto this, I will become a better person, or that will make me better than other people."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "She would come home, she would come by our house every now and then on the way back from school, and talk to my mother about issues of the school."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "As I said, this is not just rituals and it's not just precepts."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The two other examples, there was a professional soldier who had been told by his teachers, okay, if you die in battle, it will take you to heaven."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "You have to go to the heaven of heroes."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "He never says there is a self."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Non-self? No, non-self means, is this me? You point to something, is this me, is that me? And the answer is no."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "What did you think of that? There's a question back here."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "That is not really that serious an issue."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So the Buddha is talking, they're talking, looking at experience from different perspectives entirely."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "There's mundane right view, there's transcendent right view, and then there's the ultimate right view where everything is just arising and passing away as suffering and you let go of it all."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So what's your advice on that? Okay, we could talk for a whole day on that one."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The perceptions you have, i."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "That's the suffering that weighs on the mind."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And then finally saying, hey, they're shaking my leg."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I mean, clinging is addiction, basically."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I think part of my question was what she has already asked."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So basically a progressive process to acquire new activities."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Once you have identified it and you can clearly see that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And when it arises, seeing what's causing it to arise, what comes along with it? The second step is seeing it pass away."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So you can pacify that part of you that you are bigger, bigger than that part."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And you have the courage to become what you want to become through the new process."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And so then, are you becoming this book? You're in the realm of becoming."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Ajahn, you talked about the clinging to views, sorry, self-views."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Rather than saying, well, this is just the left over hormone discharge that came with the original burst of anger."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But I wonder if there's more to that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "So in this guided meditation, mostly what I'd like to explore is recognizing the moment when mindfulness returns after you've been lost in thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so I often like to recommend beginning a period of practice with some relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "And so exploring, relaxing the face, around the eyes and mouth, the jaw, relaxing the neck, the shoulders, the arms and hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Relaxing the chest and upper back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Not something to try to do, but it's almost like an invitation or kind of inclining towards that possibility and seeing if the mind and body are kind of willing to show us a little bit more softening, a little bit more relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Or it might be a general sense of your body sitting or the sense of the whole body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "We can see if we can allow ourselves to settle back and see what is mindfulness receiving right now in this field of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "And yet there is a moment when there's the awareness that the mind has been wandering."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And with your eyes closed, perhaps there's not even any really clear boundaries between inside and outside your hand."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "Those sensations just exist in the hand for themselves and themselves."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "The energy or the vitality of being alive, you can sense the sensations."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And there's a way of feeling that in your body, recognizing it, is no different than the sensations of your hand."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And then maybe you can expand your awareness to include the mental activity of thinking and wanting and not wanting."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And it's quite something to contemplate death, contemplate life and death in a room with cadavers."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "I didn't want to hurt them."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "I didn't want to be disrespectful."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "But you know, we were touching and looking and talking and there was no, that body was not hearing or feeling or experiencing or thinking about what we were doing."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And so, and that's what I wanted to highlight today was this idea of how all these things, all the things which are the symptoms, the manifestation of our aliveness, can be experienced as being free of us, as being free of our desires and preferences."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "There's actually freedom in hearing a sound."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "It's possible, this is the only little blink you have to experience the gift of life, of aliveness."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "You see the world out there because those of you who have eyesight, because you have eyesight."}

{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "In traditional Buddhist countries, giving is usually explained as."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "We should find at least one worthy cause that resonates with us, and we should make it a point to provide some assistance to the best of our ability to help those who are less fortunate."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "So we think that wisdom develops out of concentration."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "But to mature the development of the mind within the dharma, it's important to clarify our understanding."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "One doesn't go to a library, a bookshop, or order books from amazon."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And so this is the cultivation of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And thus we have these four supporting conditions for the practice of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "Okay, maybe at this point I'll just ask if anybody has any questions."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "On a human level, I say kindness is more important than wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "From the standpoint of liberation, let's say wisdom is the quality that directly brings liberation, but kindness is the most important as the foundation for one's spiritual development."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "If I try to relate it now, I might mix it up."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And so what we'd have to do is make provisional judgments as to what is right, what is wrong."}

{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So that's the theme I wanted to explore this evening, this shaping quality, the way that both we are shaped by our circumstances, by our environment, and that how we are in relationship to that shapes our mind further."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "This is one of the processes that goes on."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So much of what we actually think of as physical is actually more constructed in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Even the experience of whether something feels good, whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, that is understood in Buddhist psychology to be a creation of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "There's not actually a person on the back of my retina, the image of what I am interpreting as a person on the back of my retina, but the idea of person is born in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Form and color is pretty neutral, but so when we think something is pleasant or unpleasant in the field of sight, it's usually because we have overlaid a concept on that, and we think the concept is pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "It's like it's all mediated through our senses and our mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so very much the way that we take in the world, this perception, is shaped."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And then the fifth of these five parts of our experience that the Buddha pointed to is a very simple, kind of just, it's just a simple, not simple, but it's just the capacity of our mind to know experience."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "It's a simple thing in that it's not doing much other than just with every experience."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "They're really what shape our experience."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so as I said that there's a lot of these different volitional formations."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so we don't think of these as emotions, but they have this similar kind of when they're present in our minds, when concentration is present in our minds, it affects how we act."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "We all have a kind of favorite habitual tendency, tendencies of orientation to the world."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "We are fighting, we are kind of, the flow and the habits of conditioning are a very powerful force."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so, you know, the mindfulness gives us an opportunity to kind of intervene in that force and choose a different direction."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so it's kind of shaping that, you know, that when we're angry, I remember on one retreat, I was watching my mind and I had, I was as many times I got to watch my mind and see anger in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And I turned around at the end of one walking path and there was a pair of shoes at the other end of my walking path and they were not my shoes."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So the anger shaped actually the feeling of the experience of that seeing."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Sometimes the perception can actually be shaped."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "But this particular one that they watched, they said, yeah, okay, so we can even fool you if you know the gorilla is going to be there."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So watch this video and count the number of times the basketball is passing."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Okay, maybe the gorilla is going to walk through, maybe not, but see if you can just see what happens here."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And then I saw the gorilla."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "The problem comes in when we think our mind is seeing everything."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so this shaping quality, the problem here is when we think our minds are accurately receiving experience and we behave in that way."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so that's what's embedded in the aversion, is that view, that belief."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And this is what the Buddha found and discovered, is that there is a different kind of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So the compassion can, can, there could be compassion both for the person who is being hurt and for the person who is hurting."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Oh, things as they are, that's what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "The action when compassion is arising would be, stop, that's not, that's not appropriate."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so, you know, we, we begin to be aware of how the anger shapes our mind, the love shapes our mind, the wisdom shapes our mind, the compassion shapes our mind."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And we start to see there's a different way, a different way to respond to situations."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Ultimately, when we think about it, the entirety of everything on this planet at some point is going to be gone anyway."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So there's a little assumption embedded in there."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "There's not a lot of choice in the matter for those beings."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta", "completion": "May all beings everywhere be free."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "We're expanding the spheres, these circles, moving towards boundlessness."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "So it's more about our relationship, our perception, not about them and the nature of them."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "So just an invitation to maybe soften this idea that we have sometimes about that we're going to fix or change or something the other person."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "And so difficult means in this setting for this purpose, difficult means there's some tension, there's some friction, a little bit of irritation, a little bit of dislike, some non-smoothness."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "And for me, this is one of the beautiful things about letting kindness practice is we plant seeds and they sprout."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Maybe this loving kindness kind of shades into some compassion."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Something else is to see the person holistically."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "All of us have mothers, fathers, other family members who cared about us."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Instead, we are bringing some healing to our own hearts."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Maybe taking a moment to scan through the body and notice those places of tension or tightness and allowing them to soften as best they can."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Perhaps imagining them here in the room with you today."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Have more ease and spaciousness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "It's a very simple reflection, basically."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "And a little supportive reminder for myself that I find as I attune to how I am in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "This is the experience that is supposed to be happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Again, contact, breathing, pulsing, hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What else is happening right now? To help the mind recognize something that might be hidden, particularly in how we are attending to experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "Grief is, you know, many many factors come into play with grief."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "So sometimes when there's grief, it's very useful to go find someone to talk to that you can just talk the story, talk what's going on, talk about the events of it, and talk about the expectations, the hopes that have been shattered."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "If we're dismissive of grief and think that we're not supposed to grieve or it's wrong to grieve or we have to grieve quickly or something, then we don't allow ourselves to grieve in our way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "That's really a big part of it is bringing things to light and really seeing and learning to identify all the different component parts of it, the emotional aspect of it, the physical aspect of it, the cognitive aspects of it that involves the beliefs and the stories."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "So to bring that to light and let it be, let's live there and we see it clearly."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "So that's part of mindfulness practice."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And one of the ways that you can do this is of course you're going to be thinking anyway, you can't just turn it, turn a switch and turn it off, but recognizing it as it is and then take the story as if you have, you can gather it together, the meaning, and compost it in the body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And so to put aside, and that's why when we sit and meditate and keep putting aside our thoughts, letting go of our thoughts, and learning the skill, learning the art of that, that this serves us really well in times of challenges like grief, where sometimes that's a trigger for a lot of intense aspects of the story and meaning and purpose and memories and the operation, you know, it churns up expectations and anticipations and hopes that are now been shattered."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And so I define grief as the pain that arises in the emptiness associated with loss."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And I'll be at the Insight Retreat Center going down there when I finish here today."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So, so like to, I like to share something from Take Not Han book tonight."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So Take Not Han says about real love."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand them."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "I don't want to make you suffer."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "With understanding, the one we love will certainly flower."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So as we've practiced together in this happy hour in the past, with, say, with the neutral being, with the person we don't know very well, and we bring this sense of common humanity, just like me, taking their perspective, just like me, as a human being who wants to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So I'd like to invite us all to land, to arrive in your body, in your posture, if you need to move, to sit, to your cushion, or lie down."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Entering a posture that's going to be comfortable for the next 30 minutes or so, and landing, arriving in this body here, here, here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Not trying to conquer, but to open up to things as they are, this breath, this sensation, with open-heartedness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And if I do so because of my ignorance, please tell me so that I can love you better."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "If it feels appropriate to move on, that's okay also."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "To see you from your complicated, complex, beautiful perspective of the uniqueness of you, as if I were gazing through the world, through your eyes, as much as possible."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Just a tiny, tiny bit challenging, just a touch challenge, where there isn't much energy, and if no one comes up, then go back to your dear person, or yourself."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "What if you were them? Even if you, their areas, their personality you don't like, or you disagree, can you love them? Meaning, can you understand them better? Just a little better."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So we have time for reflections and I just got the note that my internet is a little unstable, I hope you can hear me, I know probably my image is freezing, but you are welcome, hopefully you can still hear me."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "The private question coming, I have quit meditating for many months now, the reason being every time I sit to meditate, my mind wanders and I become enraged with hatred for people who have done wrong to me, although they are not in my life anymore."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "How can I get engaged in regular meditation again? Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "They don't even know I'm hurting right now."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Well, the only near and dear self that I have is myself."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "That's the best I can do is to accept that."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Thank you, Nikki, the invitation to ask myself what I need, how I can love and support this being was timely and moving."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And Dave says compassion and Nitta for the Russians were suffering as well."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And can we, can we hold patiently each other and just listen or share as little or as much as you need to? Let's start with maybe 10, 15 seconds of silent meta for one another, and then share as little as you like, or maybe just hold witness for one another."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So, so why don't we dedicate the merit and close our practice together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Thank you all for practicing and made them the goodness of our cultivation together may be a cause and condition for goodness, for, for real love, for care in the world, may all beings be well, may all beings be happy, including ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "Oh, I got to keep one for me."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "Right, please let me know if I'm not coming through sound-wise."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I think I might get started."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "It's about what goes wrong when people have serious mental illnesses or psychiatric disorders."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "Not in any way to put down the remarkable qualities of the human brain and mind."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So we have these instinctive tendencies that shape how we perceive the world, what we care about in the world, and how we respond."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I've put a Suta from the Suta Napata on the first page of the handout."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And the Buddha saw this and he saw the thorn in the heart that provoked this way of responding to the world."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "This refers to the body and the material world as it interacts with our sense fields, what we know of the material world in our body."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And then, I think I don't know if I mentioned perception and all that, big part of the brain and then of course consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So these coordinated movements."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "We also have a lot of vision in the parietal cortex as well."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "That's where we diverge from the reptiles."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And that is the calculating unit of the cortex."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And I'll leave some time for questions because I imagine there will be some."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "The functional output of these tiniest calculating units require all three of these in order to function."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And a fish, and most amphibians, they're mostly hindbrain."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "But all three brains, the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain, have the capacity to regulate an animal's behavior."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And our architecture, I think, really does make it possible to do this."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So I think maybe I'll stop there and see if there are questions."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I see how fear and anger avoidance, how we evolved to have those abilities in order to survive."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "It's not probably localized."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "They don't have what philosophers call access consciousness, where they write books and things, where they manipulate symbols in an abstract way and see themselves abstractly."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "But it's an integrated thing."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I promise I will cover that."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "Well, and it's held in the cells, especially in where they touch other cells in the brain."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So I'm curious if you're going to bring this into the day at some point."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "The word attention I'm using here as an umbrella term for a variety of different attentional factors that we have."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But we're often kind of so preoccupied in what we're paying attention to, and that could be our inner landscape, our thoughts and feelings, that the very fact that we're aware kind of goes unnoticed."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "She's like, wow, this is so cool."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "It's usually translated into English as either as wise attention or wise consideration."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And this is the ability to be paying attention enough to what's happening in the present moment with yourself, to be able to consider, understand what is healthy for you to do and what is unhealthy, what is skillful and what is unskillful."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But if we can step back and clearly see my mind is involved in hostility, is that where I want my attention to go? Is that where my attention should go and feed and develop? The Buddha says whatever you do frequently becomes the inclination of the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "I would rather have my attention be used in a different way."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And in the Buddha as well, this mani-sikara, kara means to make or to do, or to generate."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "Rather than, if we don't use that choice, then our unconscious will kind of take us this way and that way, and will be preoccupied and lost, and advertisers will use it, will grab it."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And that is that as we are paying attention, part of what can be possible in attention giving is to clearly understand what it is we're looking at, what it is we're aware of perceiving."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And clear comprehension is a knowing that recognizes or cognizes what we're aware of."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "Tuning into your body, your thoughts, your breathing, all this stuff."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "It gives us access to something that's of a very nice quality."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "They shouldn't have done that."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And many of the complicated ways we live in the world is through the filter of stories, opinions, memories, projections, expectations, judgments, commentary that we have."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "Another way they talked about attention, another element, was observation."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "We're supposed to do clear comprehension, do this wise consideration, do observation, do experiencing things, do relaxing."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And the Buddha referred to this as pati sati, like pati sati."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And this is where the awareness starts becoming stronger and stronger."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "We keep pushing them and they don't ever have a chance to rest."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So the attentional apparatus inside, when there's no distractions and agitation and preoccupations of thoughts and all this stuff, and it gets quiet, then it gets."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And it's a relaxed, soft mind that it's easier to let go."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And we kind of focus on those that lead us towards being kinder, softer, less attached, less preoccupied people."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And so to be able to use our attentional capacity to redirect our thoughts, to redirect where our focus on is a great gift."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And part of the motivation to talk about it is that it's a very common state for many people, for everyone's some point or other."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "But a shift happens in meditation that at some point that rather than saying, oh, I'm afraid now, the meditator will say, there is fear now."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Because it's almost like we're so fully defined by it, it's like we can't, normally without a mirror, we can't see the eyes that see."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "It's very radically different from being aversive to fear and angry at fear or ashamed of fear or trying to fix fear or attacking fear or trying to analyze it or figure out what's going on."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "The fear doesn't feel like it's being shamed or pushed away or denied or unwanted, which is hard, just like it would be hard for a little child."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And one of the first things we can do in exploring it is we can try to assess whether the fear is appropriate or not."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And so in Buddhism, one of the appropriate fears is the fear of doing something, of oneself doing something that injures one's own integrity."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Maybe I'm going to learn to hold my tongue."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Or maybe I'm even going to avoid certain stressful situations when I'm in this mood if I can avoid them."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "But sometimes it's a messenger that something inside of us feels threatened."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And that's a fascinating thing to realize that what we're afraid of is partly a product of our imagination."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Integrity is kind of real enough, important enough to protect."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Sometimes what's being threatened are the constructs that we live under, the constructs of self, the ideas, how we've identified us, how we've constructed our idea of who we are."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "That their idea, their identity as being a wise and funny person is threatened."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Without that idea, that can't be threatened."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "It's okay if some people don't like me."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "But just keep looking and feeling and getting to know."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "The more we can discover it, the more we can explore it."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "It's better not to explore it and be with it for very long."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And then pull away and come back to another day."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "So it's a little bit an extension of befriending the fear."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Knows how to morph into what needs to happen next."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And that has different sides of release."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Continuity", "completion": "And so that's it creates more of a relaxation in a way."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Continuity", "completion": "As the mindfulness gets more continuous that's when the mind can really start to see into what's going on in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Continuity", "completion": "So that is one tool that can support continuity is to use a kind of a noting practice."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "This is I think something that is probably in the air a lot these days."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So I thought I'd talk about it from the perspective of how we can explore it with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "What these states actually are and how we can explore them with mindfulness and how we can learn something about ourselves, about our experience through exploring them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "There's anxiety, worry, fear, dread, terror."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "The sense of what will become of me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "You're in a car and somebody hits you from the side and you find yourself spinning in front of the traffic."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "You're kind of immediately, this sense of danger and this sense of fear can come up."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's, I think, a very natural response to a threatening situation."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I think this is kind of a main way that it comes about."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "We start thinking into the future."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So I want to just explore for a moment what the future is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "We think it will be threatening or not."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Then there is a kind of fear that can come up or anxiety or worry that can come up out of bodily experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Not necessarily from thoughts around a state of mind but just maybe in your childhood there was a situation where you get into a particular situation and things are unpredictable or threatening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So when we act out of those emotions, we tend to perpetuate them because we are essentially we are believing the ground out of which they're springing."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "What does it feel like in the body to feel free fear? There's tightness, contraction in the stomach, perhaps a contraction in the throat, moisture sweating on the palms."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So beginning to explore that distinction for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Highlight that for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Without being so resistant or reactive."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So if we're have a state of anxiety, and we're not able to be aware of it and have this spaciousness around it, we may find ourselves just kind of running all over the place, doing all kinds of things, responding out of that anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And I don't have to go running all over the place about this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So I want to have some other things I could say about working with fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "That we can become more open to the fact that things are uncertain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And not so reactive to that."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Whatever comes, it's like, oh, okay, this is what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And so we begin to see the cultivating tool of a balanced mind gives us what we need to meet whatever comes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "That we all have this deep wish to be safe."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It seems very natural to us that of course in not knowing whether I'm going to be safe but fear would be the result."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And there was some bad weather and my plane was delayed taking off from Tennessee and I was flying connecting in Houston and I landed in Houston and I had missed my connecting flight and so I had to be put up in a hotel in Houston near George Bush International Airport."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's like I envisioned us all in the hallway pressing our little glow watches."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I need to do some meta here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I mean unskillful response to that wish for safety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "May all beings be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And there's a lot of different skills that we learn around mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I remember once in school, a teacher was talking about, write a list of the 10 biggest fears you've ever had in your life."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And so any thoughts, if you will, on the immobilizing solution, if you will, in quotes."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I kind of get this weekly."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "We're coming up against the trying itself in a way."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Questions is what I'd like to explore this evening."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "But there's also the possibility of using some tools, because sometimes it doesn't work, it's like whatever that relationship is, the strength of the reactivity, the strength in that case, if there's something unpleasant happening and I don't like it, sometimes the strength of that not liking is so strong that just being aware of it is not going to have any traction."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Remarkably, it created the space for curiosity around how mind and body get entangled in bad breathing habits."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "It's a very great description of using that first method."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And so trying to use the breathing as the object of concentration there is probably not going to work because there's the reactivity in there."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So, is there greed, is there aversion is there delusion, and sometimes simply becoming aware of the relationship is enough so that it, you know, so sometimes that's enough."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And if it's, and if that's not enough, then, you know, kind of the adjusting the the attitude is like the first pieces to, you know, can you be aware of the attitude and, and if you can be aware of the attitude, that might be sufficient."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So that's a that's another equally valid version of redirecting the attention."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And they don't have to be about what what what we what I shared it could be about any anything."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "A little bit of wisdom that can be supportive is the reflection that being aware of the experience the awareness of the experience is not doesn't have the quality of the the challenge."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "The awareness itself is not sleepy."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "That's that's a little bit of wisdom to to reflect to that can be used but somebody asked at one point, can you expand on this? You know, what does it mean? How do I understand this? And so just a little analogy or image that might be supportive."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "I mean, there's many different ways that we see or learn that that strategy is not reliable in terms of a lasting happiness."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "And yet at a deeper level, we have these patterns too because we're human beings and we've evolved from animals and single-celled organisms all the way up through animals and the evolutionary nature of our biology also seems to give us this movement towards things that we like and away from things that we don't like."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "We can model the outcome of our choices."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "We can look at what's happening in our experience, learn from our past experience and model what might happen in the future."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "And so while we do have this evolutionary kind of penchant towards moving in the direction of pleasant and moving away from unpleasant, we seem to have a kind of a modeling system in between us and the pleasant and unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "So much of the time, I'd say, we simply follow our conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "So that's part of the learning."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "It's learning that this strategy is not helpful."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "To begin teasing apart the different elements of it, and seeing that we have attitudes, we relate to it, we bring a certain kind of desires, wishes, fears, attachments to all these different component parts."}

{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "No aversion, very clear, so clear."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "The negative was much more salient than the positive."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "So there's a certain kind of optimism and faithfulness that's associated with the greed and a certain kind of discernment and clarity associated with aversion and a certain kind of like equanimity associated with delusion."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Hey boys, how's the water? And then in the second frame, the big fish has swam past and the two little fish are talking to each other and one little fish says to the other, what the hell is water? In some ways, we're deluded until we're not."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And to do this, to establish this sense of willingness, we first have to get over a certain kind of shame in not knowing there's a kind of disorientation when the rug is pulled out from under our self understanding."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "They're really, like, mobilized by any threat to who we think we are or what makes us of value."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Even when he really needs to surrender to the wisdom of Google Maps, but he won't, you know, because it's like, you know, I'm being playful, but this is real, actually."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Like, there's really, like, the sense of, like, oh yeah, I know, oh yeah, the teacher said, explore a version, like, alright, you know."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "We actually, there's a lot of value just in getting quiet in the kind of frenzy of the mind when it feels like we're so bombarded by phenomena, it's hard to actually know what we're even believing."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Like, with the kind of chaotic noise of the mind, it's like, we actually have trouble tracing out what our commitments are."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And a lot of Dharma practice is actually noticing with more and more subtlety what we actually believe, or what our behavior conveys about our beliefs, our commitments, what it conveys about how we think we will be happy, what we think will end the seeking in the heart."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "It cut like, it was just a real grief and also like a kind of egoic wounding in this."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And it was like so the way that he did it was so elegant, you know, like, like so artfully self deceptive, you know, and he even like sprinkled in some Dharma themes, you know, to make it seem like you could buy it, you know, like, you know what I mean? Like, like there's like a little hat tip to certain Dharma principles, but at its base, it was a purely defensive mental proliferation, you know, and an unwillingness actually to feel the brunt of the initial impact of the pain."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "From a Buddhist psychological perspective, when you're caught in a debilitating ambivalence or ambiguity, your mind is either deluded and clinging to a desire for your life to be perfect, or it's afraid and wanting a guarantee that what you're doing is the right thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Or it's refusing to participate in the dance of life due to some unconscious or conscious aversion to uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Like the kind of numbed-out, dead-end state or the hyperaroused, reactive, kind of very brittle mind."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "One of the effects of that for me is like the sense, like it feels like the way I do everything is like the natural way to do it, like the preordained way."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "It's like how could you do it any other way, right? If we thought there was a different, better way, we would be doing it."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "So of course this is where you put the toothbrush, right? So the bizarreness of our choices and lives and commitments and values is highlighted by seeing other people or cultures where people just do things differently."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "My teacher kind of main influence with Shenzhen Yang and at some point he said, kind of offhandedly, he said there are two maxims for spiritual practice."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And this is something we can actually come to cherish, you know? Like I really have tried to train myself to be open to feedback, you know, as a facet of becoming more awake and more safe for others."}

{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then try to see the emotional background."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "What's going on as you're thinking? Maybe there's some kind of fear."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Mentally noting, there's aversion."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Yes, so I have a little bit of a mantra that helps me a lot."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Now, I have also to leave time for question and answer session, but let us go through the sutta real quick."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "The Buddha even said that if you can apply this and practice according to Vittacca Santana Sutta, you become a master of your thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then I said, I'd like to see a ghost."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So fear is false evidence appearing real."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Whenever I think, actually, thoughts undermine your health."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Also, they defile your mind."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Every time you think about thoughts of aversion, you become uptight, the mind gets defiled."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "That's what we call degradation."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "People who love you, they stop loving you, in other words."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I'm putting my mind somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Thank you very much for your attention and I offer this for your refriction."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So they need to apply those techniques."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "This fails, like that kind of thing."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then you have insight meditation."}

{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "As a young boy, I used to walk and then I hit my toe on a stone."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then I felt some kind of fear that, okay, this line is going to eat me because the thing was not closed and branches were breaking and all these things."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "At least as a monk, I haven't done bad things."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "That's a place of like, well, if, if, you know, if that's not me, you know, that what, what else could that be? You know, that, that there's, there seems to be a real almost like stability."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "We can see it's not stable."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "That, that can take a little bit more exploration at times to see, because those get, those are pretty deeply conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "I began to notice that the reason I thought that like self-hatred was enduring is because if it wasn't happening, I was telling myself the story, you know, that, but really what's going on is that, you know, I don't like myself or I'm a, I'm a failure."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "And then somehow we kind of put it all into one big pot and say, that's who I am."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "So, you know, when do these processes serve us? And when do they confuse us? And to begin to tease that apart."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "So, yeah, I want to also, let's see, there's not a lot of time left."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "So do you have anything now in particular that you're curious about with respect to? Yeah, Rob."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: What do we Take to be Self?", "completion": "And then we'll continue this then."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "If one is lacking or one is too strong, they'll try to make an adjustment for it."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "There's also a classic teaching that they all arise together and interplay with each other."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And I find that in thinking about it today that it's a difficult subject for me to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "When I've been on retreat I've made sometimes phenomenal amount of energy and effort in practice."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "I couldn't find how to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "If you want to sit down to do a spiritual practice, you have to apply yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And some people think that Buddhists aren't supposed to have desire."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And initiates this very strong kind of energy."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And the word virya, which is word used for energy, is a cognate to the word vira, which means hero or warrior."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And some of you might have met great practitioners like Upandita or someone who really has the warrior approach to practice."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "Suddenly something really marvelous walks through the door, and suddenly you find yourself all the energy you ever needed."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And sometimes if we've overeaten, or we've just been staying up late, or locked, or we're ourselves down, we don't have the physical energy, the vibration, the vitality, that's available to apply in different directions."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "I think when you walk a lot, walking itself is a wonderful, vitalizing exercise."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And the energy that's available to us, there's a certain way in which energy feeds on itself or grows on itself, develops with itself."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And that energy, sometimes it comes kind of crystalline or pure or beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "It's kind of energized in a wonderful, clear, restful way."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "Those are the four kind of efforts."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And you really like meditating in the morning, but you also really like reading newspaper."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "And then if you notice that something could be helpful and it's not here already, then arouse it, cultivate it."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "Sometimes I'll do practices to arouse my energy because I feel the energy needs to be there."}
{"prompt": "Right Effort", "completion": "If I feel tense or feel too energized or restless or something, I'll do certain things which are relaxing because I feel like I need to arouse that factor in order to bring the body and mind into a certain kind of balance so that it's useful to engage in the practice of mindfulness and meditation."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So welcome to Saturday afternoon."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And this comes from the Anguta Ranikaya, the book of discourses connected by numbers."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "That is related to your conceit."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Anuruddha, abandoning those three qualities, not attending to those three qualities, directed his mind to the deathless element, dwelling alone, secluded, heathful, ardent and resolute."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "You just get a polished brick."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So just relax a bit and back off and then see instead if you can just direct your mind away from these conditioned aspects and see if you can recognize the unconditioned, the deathless."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And so I studied a bit with Soukni Rinpoche."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And of course it's simple in some respects but a heck of a job to do."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "This is way too obstruous."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Then there's that letting go."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So even in those deep states of jhana, first, second, third, fourth jhana, there's still that recognition, oh, this is just a conditioned state."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "The Buddha had temptations by Mara, and it's just before his enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But can you mention how we're supposed to, should we just think, well, just touch on Mara and then leave it alone, or what should we do? I'm not sure exactly what you're asking."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There's Khanda Mara, that's the identification with the five Khandas, the body and the mental faculties."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There's Abhisankara Mara, there's only five of them, don't worry."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Lucifer was the brightest of the archangels till he got a conceit problem and was cast down from the high heavens and plunged into the pit."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So similarly Mara, just like Lucifer is the brightest of the archangels, Devaputamara is the king of the highest of the sensual heavens."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Devaputamara is the king, he's the boss of that top heaven."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Do you have a particular book or writing somewhere where we could just look at that? There are a number of things, the best book actually is in German, it's never been translated into English, by Windisch."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There's no monks in this hall."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But that's how it works, because if you cling to the idea, well, nothing matters."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Of that letting go, whereas going the opposite direction is actually going away from that, is actually a lot of clinging and the behavior itself is going toward that ultimate letting go."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Well, let's say the way I like to talk about it is that it's just like quoting Hamlet."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "All that is conditioned and thus gross, but there is the cessation of formations."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "He does not conceive himself apart from or coming from Nibbana."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "It's completely, as a total mindfulness, but it's also a mindfulness which is not caught up with any kind of delusion or it's not carried away."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So the first one is a longsuita from the Dighanikaya, the long discourse, discourse number 11."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "For where is it that the things of the world come to an end? Where is it that the four elements, the four great elements, where is it that they come to an end and cease without remainder? Like asking where is the end of the world or what's the end of the universe? And so being an adept meditator then this monk absorbs in his mind and goes up and talks to the first devas that he comes across up in the lower heavenly realms and then the first devas meet him and he asks them this question, where is it that earth, water, fire and wind cease without remainder? And then that's the retinue of the four great kings and then they say, well we don't know but if you better ask the four great kings themselves, they understand this kind of stuff, they're really smart, they know these things, you better ask them."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Saka, the king of the Tava Tingsa heaven, he's excluded on this kind of stuff, you better ask him, he's a disciple of the Buddha so he should know."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So this is quote number 8."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So, that's a very significant and often quoted teaching."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And this is one of the very rare places that vinyana is used to describe a transcendent quality of mind."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But in this respect, vinyana is a transcendent quality."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So, when the mind rests in that consciousness, which is, say, sinless or non-manifestative, it is formless, it's limitless, it's radiant."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So, Rigpa is Vija and Marigpa is Avija."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "It's like the Teflon, it's like the non-stick mind, that things can arrive, but they don't stick, the mind doesn't get caught up in it, they don't carry the attention away, but there are things that arise, they're known and they slide off, they fade without remainder."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Where consciousness lands and grows, mentality-materiality alights."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And if there is no water, it does not land venerable sir."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "As he says, if there's nothing for it to land on, there's no, no fear, no, no regret, no anxiety about the future, no planning, no regretting, no nostalgia, then that we're not investing in, in how great it was in the past, or how wonderful it's going to be in the future, or how terrible it's going to be in the future, but there's that abiding in the present, and we're pointing to this same kind of quality of there being awareness as a consciousness, but it's not fixating, it's not landing, and then, and thereby, not creating those seeds of, of alienation and compulsion that, that cause so much dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So, in the Buddhist teachings, the same word will get used in different ways."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "That reminds me that one of the other words in my mind is where Mahabuha talks about jitta as that which knows."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And I did the intro to the original one which is called Intuitive Awareness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But it's also helpful just when you are reading teachings or listening to the teachings to have that basic reflective attitude rather than trying to fit it into an already existent model."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to a physical form, supported by form as its object established on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase in development."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But also with all of these teachings, some of them, we read the words and you think, just like you said, what the heck does that mean? And that's fine, if we read things and think, I haven't got a clue what I was talking about, then it's often very appropriate just to put that aside and then wait till you get to one that says, ah, that makes sense."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So that rather than feeling that we have to sort of figure everything out, sometimes the way that particular teachings are phrased, they just don't match our own sort of internal mapping."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "All analogies are partial."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So then, like, as we say, the mind moves."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And so you find, at least when I'm reading his translations, I'm re-rendering words as I go along, but it's his prerogative to translate things as he likes."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "It seems like everything could be lost in translation."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And we'll have a little bit of a break after this one."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And this is where I tell the story about the encounter in Oxford."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "It was this thought which he described as having arisen on its own, and more that it was heard rather than thought, which led to Ajama Habua's full enlightenment shortly thereafter."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There is that sphere, or that sphere of being, where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no wind, no sphere of infinity of space, infinity of consciousness, of nothingness, or even of neither perception nor non-perception."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There there is neither this world nor the other world, neither moon nor sun."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There is the unborn, uncreated, unconditioned, and unformed."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So you live with this all the time, so it's important that you know it."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And then this passage, when in 1981 it was, I was living in England, it was just the early days of our monastery, the first forest monastery that we had there, Chithurst."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Then in that moment there's a recognition, oh right, there isn't really any coming or going, aha."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "But once you clear all the dangers and there's no more external threats to you as you walk, then at that point what gets highlighted is what's left to where the challenges are, which is that pebble rubbing against your foot."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "But having the sock and, you know, hiking for weeks and weeks with the socks and that seam, it might ever so subtly be rubbing and irritating and irritating eventually."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So this is all kind of the background of this teaching."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So this is a very famous teaching called the Kalama Sutta, the discourse to the Kalamas, people in Northern India that the Buddha visited."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "He answers a basically different question."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "I don't really believe it's the truth and better than your truth or something."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "He replies in a different way."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And then he tells them the criteria to use."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "But is it really a criteria of deciding what's true or false? Not really."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So, do not go by oral tradition, do not rely on oral tradition."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "People had memorized it and spoke it."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And it's, you know, some people find it like they want to rely on their reason, the capacity for careful thinking and analysis, and that's what they can really rely on."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And so now, then the Buddha says, well, this is what you can rely on."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So the Buddha is much more interested in behavior than he is in belief."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "I just was so agitated, so preoccupied with other things, I never noticed that it was there, I didn't notice the impact it had."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "You're carrying too much weight."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "Opposite of hate is love, compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "The opposite of delusion is wisdom."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "Are they censored or praised by the wise? Are they praised by the wise? Are they blameworthy or blameless? They're blameless."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And so the Buddha says, then you should undertake those things."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So to start looking at things and saying, what is this really good? Is this skillful? Is this useful? And it's noteworthy to me that when he went through this exercise with the Kalamas, the first time on greed, hate and delusion, he only used two of the criteria, skillful and harmful, or unskillful and harmful."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "It's kind of like saying, you know, you should do this and here are the, I can reassure you, this is what's going to happen to you, this is what's beneficial."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "The second assurance is that if there is no rebirth, then in this very life, you'll maintain yourself happy without any hostility or ill-will."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And it's almost as if it's a natural thing at some point for the mind to orient itself to take away the pebble that's digging into the soles of the feet."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "If you don't believe in rebirth, it's really good."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And if you don't believe in karma, it's still good."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "Those seem much more simple."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So the difference, I think, that is significant here, is that Mahaparjapati was a disciple of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So you see the resentments in your life, what is the Buddhist answer for how to actually let those go? And then maybe just like where to look for the answer, because that might be a long answer."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And as the mind becomes calmer, it becomes more workable or more fluid."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So a mind that's frozen or tight or contracted, it's hard to let go."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "But as the mind relaxes, then there's my resentment, and it becomes easy to let go because the mind becomes more flexible or wieldy in a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so beginning is sitting with kind of checking in and seeing if there are areas of the body that might be able to be relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe even taking a deeper breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then allows them to soften and relax on the out breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the area around the heart can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Mental tension is often expressed through worries or concerns about the past or the future."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What is this experience in this moment? Their sensations in the body, contact of the hands wherever they're placed, contact of the hips against the chair, cushion or bench."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And there's a kind of a more broad general sense in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just of energy sometimes we can explore kind of a vibratory, maybe tingly experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "This is something we can know and be aware of."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "You're gently staying connected with this present moment experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Seeing if it can support a calming and settling and relaxation of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Why happy hour? Well, it's self-explanatory, but it helps to consider why this hour is called happy hour."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "It's there are happy-making as you might have experienced."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "The sense of it's a deep happiness, it's a deep, deep-seated happiness and of course compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "People often confuse empathic distress when they're feeling the pain of others so much that there is no cushioning of care, of love, so they think compassion is painful and sad and difficult."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Given that so many evenings, it's, you know, we practice compassion, etc."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "We also just one last thing is in order to frame, and the frame also is, as Thich Nhat Hanh said, often on refugee boats, if everyone panics, the boat capsizes, but if there's one person who's calm, one person who cares, cares enough to be calm, the boat can't survive."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "So without a rise, as they will arise, can we release them smilingly, can we smilingly, not judgmentally, but smilingly release them, release, return, take refuge, ah, here, here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "This breath, there's the goodness of my intention, to connect, to connect."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Oh yeah, there is peace already, and other things too, but the peace is already here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "This care, caring, knowing, loves, cares, compassionate, can no suffering and touch it with love, touched with care, meeting, suffering, balanced with care, goodwill, well-wishing, like a bright, bright, warm light, the care bringing goodness to yourself and to others, anyone it touches."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Sometimes this practice can work the other way around people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "And this is a lovely way, lovely way to bring in more equipoise into your compassion practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Yeah, but just thanks for that distinction between the empathetic distress and the compassion, which actually feels good."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Thank you so much for your reflection and highlighting how timely this offering has been for you and your friend."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Yeah, it's with the spaciousness, with the spaciousness of equanimity, there is a letting go."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "And here there is also a sense of care."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "That's when it's physical sense."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "But this is Sarah speaking."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "I had to deal with a lost stolen phone today."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "My heart is warm, noticing all of it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "It is quite an inconvenience."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "So beautiful how this was an opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "Confidentiality is very important."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion Practice When Suffering of The World Feels Overwhelming", "completion": "But if there's something you want to quickly type in chat, I'll read them."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And there have been various theories over the decades about how these people got there to these remote islands."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And at one point there was a theory that people just floated there on logs, kind of on rafts, right? Sort of with the way that the currents of the ocean went."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So according to this theory, the way that the currents went, these people must have come from South America."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And one particular one is a guy named Mao Pierlog who is from the Caroline Islands and who was a master navigator."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And then his grandfather would take him to different tide pools and sort of hold him there and show him how the wind felt different and how the water felt different and taught him different aspects of that."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So here's some of the things that they use in order to navigate is the sea water."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "Feeling the winds, of course, the direction of the winds."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "You know, he understood where the islands were and then he headed towards that vision."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And it was such a moving thing for the people of Polynesia that this art was being revived."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "But, you know, it's really brought about this great resurgence."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "Everything that you need to know is already there."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So someone else might be lost, but you will never be lost if you can learn to read the ocean."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "We're getting the techniques and the practices of learning to navigate our life, the world, of being able to understand what are these different signs."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "In fact, actually, one of the journeys that they took, apparently, another journey in Nino at Thompson was the main navigator, but he had his teacher by his side."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And he said that means the bird has already caught the fish, and he's going back to his nest to feed the young."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And here what we're navigating is the oceans of the mind, really, the mind-heart."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So practice, when we're sitting here in our posture, is actually practice of being able to know that, like, well, what is here? What's going on? And then in some ways, when you're out going around in your life, it's like hopefully those navigational skills are going to serve you, to know, like, okay, what's present? What's present in my mind and heart? What's the intention that's arising? What's the energy that's arising in my body? What is it that's about to drive my speech, my actions? Is that something that I want to follow? Is that the rod I want to take? Or is there a different rod? Then we have the ones that are the energizing factors."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "They don't control the birds or the fish or the clouds."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "But what is my vision? What is it that I am actually doing this practice for? What am I on the path for? What is it that my heart is yearning for? What is it that I want at this point? So it's helpful to reflect on that, I think, because otherwise we can kind of get sometimes into a drift."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So you get into the drift on the seas."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "But then as you're actually driving there, you need to take the different turns along the way that will get you there."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "So the choice is to get on to 101 North or South."}

{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "During this whole time my parents were not very happy about this trajectory, right? So I found many letters from them during this period and the funny thing is that now I'm much closer to their age at that time than I am to my age when I was off doing all this practice."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "But then as we start to tune in more, it's like, oh, okay."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "It's a great, you know, both a great story and very inspiring."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "These giant logs would actually make their way and they'd be turned into boats."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "And he realized that there was something sacred about taking these giant trees and he felt like, well, we have to do something to renew, too."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Your Life", "completion": "We don't want them back and we don't want you to ask how much they cost or how much they're worth."}

{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And I went on a retreat and even one of the things we do is we really pay attention to the pain."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And I was just so happy that I found something that worked so well for me."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Meditation is in a lot of ways biofeedback, at least parts of it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And one of the main influences I've had is Shunzen Yang."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So let me start out first."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "I want to talk a little bit about posture."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "But for some, you know, do any of you sit on the floor? Okay."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Let the meditation be something that you enjoy, not something that you're trying to get your back to hold you up better."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "For a lot of people, using a wedge shaped pillow, actually takes the pressure away from your legs going numb."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "But it takes a little while to see if a pillow is going to work for you."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "I mean, a lot of men like this, too."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Yeah, so, you can see how that works."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Do any of you have problems, like in the mid-back and neck? Okay, do any of you feel that a lot more when you meditate? Some of you do."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "I've had a lot of people who have completely eliminated some of their meditation triggered pain by using a pillow."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "If you're in a chair, the feet should be flat."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Your hips should be just a little bit higher than your knees."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "If they're not, you can put a little cushion under your buttocks."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "The first method is with your arm."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "You know, the chair's just a little too high and not enough mat underneath."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So, I want to say two things."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Just by getting the pressure off the area, you know, where the blood vessels are, just by removing that pressure from that hard edge, using one of those pillows made all the difference for me."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So I played with a lot of Zafus, you know, and you have to really give them a good chance, you know, and so it's great we've got lots of samples here to play with."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And as the area gets bigger, you know, for the pianist, it's easier to play piano."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "I want to pay attention to one aspect of it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "If you've got palpitations and you worry about them and your heart, you know, don't watch the chest."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And even if you watch it at the nostrils, if you have a really bad cold, don't try to force the attention there."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "It's very helpful to keep still for the mind to quiet."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Where when you're meditating, you're trying to be natural and it feels like you're still controlling it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "It's just what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Now let's begin with a few deep breaths and relaxing just a little more with each exhale."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Get a general sense of how you feel right now."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "What's moving when you breathe? You may feel the belly going up and down or the chest rising and falling, the air coming in and out of the nostrils."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Now keep your attention in your home base."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "If you decide to use the words to help you, keep the words very lightly in the background."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "That's exactly what we'll be addressing in the next piece."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "There's two ways of working with pain."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Both ways are useful at different times."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So when we focus towards pain, tonight we'll be talking about focusing towards the pain."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And by dividing it into these little manageable pieces, it becomes a lot more manageable."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And many of you have done this at some point, but do it with me again this time."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "This will just be a minute exercise, and I'd like you to make a fist with one hand."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And then notice how it actually feels inside."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "How does it feel where the fingers are touching the palm? Notice wherever sensation is the strongest in that hand."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And then notice the sensations."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So you're going to let your mind land wherever it feels like landing, and you're going to explore that spot."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So that's how we'll be doing it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Every time it changes, relax your whole mind and body into the change."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So how was that for you? Any comments or any questions? Was there any confusion for anybody? I know that my body goes into muscles tightening that create shear on my spine and then my leg twitches."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "But it, so you're not finding any discomfort in your body."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And that's just one aspect of it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So the more you can just relax your body throughout the day, even for just one minute, can retrain your brain."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "The second breath, when you exhale, you relax your shoulders and arms."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "So just that one breath is powerful."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "Inhale, and on the third exhale, you're going to relax your entire back."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And on the fifth breath, when you exhale, relax your thighs, your legs, your feet."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "And now try to fill your whole body in these last three breaths."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "If you find that you particularly get tense in one area, you know, feel free to add that to one of the breaths."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain (1 of 3)", "completion": "I'll be here at seven and I'd be happy to, you know, go over how you're meditating."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Again, we've been following the theme of loving kindness practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Perhaps taking a few breaths through the area of your heart."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "There's no right or wrong about what you feel there."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Just allowing yourself to remember and visualize the ways in which you've hurt others."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Maybe another couple of minutes with this aspect of the reflection bringing up ways that you've harmed others."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Breathing through the area of your heart and just feeling."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "There are many ways that we do things that harm ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "For ways that you have harmed me intentionally or unintentionally, I forgive you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Again, it's not about condoning any action."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "With each wish of goodwill, allowing yourself to feel into the area of your heart and notice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Continuing for the next few minutes in silence with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "And consciously recognizing you are one of all beings."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "May all beings live with ease."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Forgiveness and Loving Kindness", "completion": "Continuing for the last minute of the sitting."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "The days come one after the other, nights come one after the other."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Those emotions, those feelings, those concerns, those fears."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And some things come to an end."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "This is the last time you're going to look at, if you wake up early enough, the dawn coming up."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And so, maybe you won't know your last time that you."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Because that boss stayed and stayed and stayed."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "So there's that ordinary experience of change and impermanence."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "I had these ideas of what was coming, and what was coming was going to be that way forever."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "It hadn't even come, and I already had ideas about it, what it was going to be like."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "But as the mind settles in meditation, we don't live in ideas so much anymore."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And I can close my eyes and have my idea of my hand."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "You know, it goes on and on and on."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Some people have very nice relationships with their hands."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And so just start seeing in the moment the flow of change, the flow of change, the constancy of inconstancy as we sit."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "So, it can be a surprise for some people to sit down and meditate."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "The second is the one that is seen as the mindfulness meditation gets deeper, stronger."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "An interesting place to do that, and this is why meditation can be kind of helpful for this, is in meditation your thinking can slow down dramatically."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "But in meditation it gets very, very quiet in there, it can."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "It's a freedom from definition."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Because clinging tends to arise more often than not in relationship to thoughts."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "I mean, if your clinging is always two ideas, I mean, that's, I mean, is that worth it? Is it worth clinging to ideas? Or is it better to have ideas and use them to guide our lives and support our lives but not cling to them? To have ideas be light."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And they say in Buddhism that this peace, there's a peace that belongs to kind of an, in a certain kind of way, belongs to an unchanging dimension of our life."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "What is your relationship to change? What happens if you tune in for a while to the changing nature of phenomena rather than to the phenomena in and of itself? And then can you use that to see your relationship to it? Are you trying to stop the change? Are you trying to encourage it? Are you clinging to something? What is your relationship to change? Are you comfortable with change? Is this the idea of change frightening? Is the idea of change confusing? What is your relationship to change? If you continue doing mindfulness practice and meditation, chances are that your relationship to change become more and more trusting and comfortable, more and more easeful with it."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "I don't think I thought about things very much for a while."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Also a few years later one of my friends had Alzheimer's and I used to go see her."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "We just sort of like this garbage truck hit me."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "There was a point early where I knew how to get around in the bathroom."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "And then one day, I knew that you go to the toilet and then you wash your hands and then I go back to my bed."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Then I asked somebody what happened."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Things came back and sometimes they came back and they were a little disappointed."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "Like my first meal, my last meal, or my last time talking to one of my friends."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "There's something wonderful about the Buddhism that is to wake up."}
{"prompt": "To Be Changed By Change", "completion": "They might live for 50 years, but those 50 years become a lot of special moments."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (1 of 5) Suffering", "completion": "Why are we here? What's the most important thing for us to do? And so religions provide often sense of meaning and purpose and an interpretation of what's important, what priorities are, what we do with suffering, what's the meaning of suffering, what's the purpose in our life and relationship to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (1 of 5) Suffering", "completion": "And I think there's some real value in offering kind of a Buddhism light where we don't kind of pile in a lot of the Buddhist meaning, the Buddhist sense of purpose, Buddhist religiosity that surrounds it and just make it accessible to people easily."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (1 of 5) Suffering", "completion": "I want to be able to finish the work that I do I love life and I just want to be able to live it fully I'm afraid of death and I'm trying to put it off as much as I can."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation - Aware of Perception", "completion": "It's fine to just let the mind be with experience as it's unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation - Aware of Perception", "completion": "Time to time checking the attitude."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation - Aware of Perception", "completion": "We don't need anything to happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation - Aware of Perception", "completion": "It can be interesting to turn and watch this process of perception."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And why is that? And what's so important about action? That his teachings are associated with action as being so important."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And given the war in the Ukraine, and given the emphasis on action, I want to tell a little story from the 1950s, that is kind of circled around Western Dharma circles."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And then he handed back the application, but with a note on it, and the note said, drinking a cup of green tea, I stopped the war."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Do you really stop the war with drinking a cup of tea? Isn't this ridiculous to say that? Isn't it somehow diminishing the horror of what's happening to, in your comfort of your own kind of life, drinking a nice cup of tea and saying that I stopped the war? How could that, you know, what is this? What's going on? So partly this talk will be kind of an exploration of this very topic."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "If it's one more thing in a long list of things that have to be done for the day, one more thing that interferes with being anxious about tomorrow and whatever is going on, sweeping the kitchen floor might seem like just something to get over quickly and finish and just grab the broom really tight and just speed through it."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And then when it's over, if you pay attention, that person might notice that it was actually kind of tiring."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "It adds to the stress of the day, it continues the stress of the day."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Your thoughts are organized in harmony so that they're actually involved with that too as opposed to being someplace else."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And so you start to gather yourself around the sweeping and you discover that there's ways of doing it, gripping the broom, your posture, the speed in which you do it."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "How you grip the broom and how quick you do it and all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "You can feel as you get close to the corners, there's just like pulling back and navigating and negotiating and bargaining and like, okay, I don't have to do everything."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "I can just be and Buddhism gives me permission just to be."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So the very doing we do is nourishing, supportive, creates a kind of a beautiful environment internally for ourselves, physically, mentally, emotionally."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "As we start paying attention and noticing how it is and what happens to us as we meditate, as we get more settled and calm and we see more, it isn't just about becoming calm."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "What's more important than becoming calm is beginning to discover and track the different ways we are in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "You notice when we are, for example, calm and when we're agitated or where we are in that spectrum and begin feeling, well, being agitated is kind of stressful."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "They're maybe stressful or even harmful."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And so in one way or the other, some of us will have very strong ideas, beliefs that were supposed to be, or it's good to be, angry, anxious, greedy, conceited with what we do."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Of course I'm supposed to be the best kitchen sweeper on my block."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "There are four words, a little bit my own version of these four."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Prevent, stop, start, protect."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "As we have a stronger and stronger reference point of peace within, it becomes more and more subtle, understanding how to prevent."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Just as a good preventive mechanism from getting cavities, mental cavities, mind cavities."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So how do you do that activity so that it supports the best in you? So it supports harmony, beauty, peacefulness, calm."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "You know, it's like, knock that thought out of the way."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "If you're desperately doing it, holding on for dear life, maybe that's not the most conducive to getting the best out of it."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "As we go along with this, then when we encounter the world and all the horrible and beautiful things that can happen in the world, that reference point is available."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "For those of us here in California, is your being angry, your being despairing, going to help anything? Why give into despair? When you're sitting quietly and you see that moving into despair is a choice, it comes with beliefs that are evoking the despair."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Because if there's going to be any chance for world peace, it has to come out of that."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And there are many ways of responding."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "But this is a sacrilegious idea in the United States."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So the heart, the heart of the heart, is sweetly still, sweetly unagitated, unmoving."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "So hello and welcome everyone."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "It's a practice that calms the mind, that pacifies the mind, that stills the mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "And it's like petting, it's like petting the mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "Petted with the out-breath, kindly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "The chest, area around the heart center, with each out-breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Nourishing Practice of Metta-Infused Mindfulness of the Breath", "completion": "As if the breath is lovingly petting a kitty."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And in his own journey, he was asking the question, is it possible to be free from suffering? He looked around the world and saw that people were struggling and suffering around aging, illness, and death."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "He found that there's a kind of a tightening in our mind around these experiences of impermanence and unreliable experience and that we basically fight those truths."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And it is the not fighting piece, the not fighting part where our peace lies, our freedom from the suffering lies."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "It goes right into just about everything that we, every experience that we have, we have this kind of push-pull around."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And the Buddha had recognized that that path, the practice of denying and mortifying the body was not going to answer the question he had."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "But the very first part of the teaching was he taught the Eightfold Path and then he went into the Four Noble Truths with them."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so he pointed to, okay, so the craving that leads to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And the path way to understanding that for ourselves, to freeing our own minds, is this Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And that those are the roots that create suffering in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So he framed his understanding and said, you know, this is the basis, you need to understand this."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so that movement is very deeply embedded in our evolutionary biology."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And this is part of what the Buddha discovered too, that it is possible to change our minds, that we can recondition our minds."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "Because in a moment, the next aspect of the Eightfold Path of Wise Intention, in a moment, our choices are, are kind of revealed or we choose to act based on intention."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So the, the belief that's embedded in the, in the greed is, it cannot fathom that there would be any other motivation to act for well, for our well-being and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "Let's see what's going on in there."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "As I said, you know, we, we in the past had, had kind of leapt over that for the purpose of getting the thing that we want or getting rid of the thing that we don't want."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "Um, um, I've mentioned the, the four kinds."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so in our, in our sitting practice, we, sometimes it's, I mean, it's not, it's not always easy to set thoughts aside, but we, we, we have the luxury of being able to, to not engage with the content of our thoughts in our sitting practice."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so this is another area of, you know, in, in daily life practice, bringing in an awareness of content."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so the, the, every now and then my mind just stops."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so the, a lot of our idea with sitting meditation, you know, content is not so relevant."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "False speech is speaking, not what is not true with the intention to deceive."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So I changed the message that said, please leave a message."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So another piece around each of these areas of why speech and the, the ethical areas in general is that each aspect is not only, you know, connected with something we're letting go of."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "The opposite side, the, the, the performance side or what, what we cultivate, the quality, the wholesome quality that's cultivated is unification and harmony."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So that that's, that's a piece of, of something to notice is, is the tone in our voice."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So essentially, talk without intention, you know, unintentional speech in a way."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "So, as I began, I said that that dukkha is displacing dukkha, which is displacing dukkha, and it's almost hard to, hard to keep track of the, the impact of one crisis on another, the layering of, of suffering, and I think I, I heard etymologically dukkha, that word suffering, this unsatisfactoriness, some kind of connotation of, of an axle not fitting into a wheel perfectly, and so you get a rough ride."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And in the context of, of this, I, I think of, I think of grief, I think of gratitude."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "She wrote, when I'm feeling dreary, annoyed and generally unimpressed by life, I imagine what it would be like to come back to this world for just a day after having been dead."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And the question is sort of like, all right, well, how much do the teachings change in tone, in emphasis, based on the sociopolitical moment? How much do they change? And to some extent, this gets us into the terrain of traditionalist adaptationists, what we could call adaptationists, those who are maybe lean more in the kind of, I don't know, fundamentalist direction or those who are actively trying to adapt teachings to integrate other bodies of knowledge to address new concerns."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And I asked, I asked how the analogy holds up."}

{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "And then she said, I put myself on a mission."}
{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "And a big part of the Dharma practice has to do with seeing, observing, paying attention, or pinning up to seeing new ways, in the new ways of seeing."}
{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "And when we hit a challenge like this that may be outside of our own control, can we use this as an opportunity to stop, to pause, to slow down and then to look."}
{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "And another opportunity to see, another way of seeing is can an illness or a challenge be seen as a gift bestowed upon us? I know in my cancer group, and there was this person who oftentimes shared an outpouring sense of gratitude and love that she received."}
{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "But when we begin to open ourselves up to some of these new perspectives that we may not have had the chance to touch to see, it began to soften and loosen our grip to some of the fixed ideas that we may have."}

And as you breathe out, when is the air no longer you? In your lived experience, can you define this? And for me, I can't find those kind of boundaries."}

{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And in that sense, the person who can, you know, our concern would be how to get, maybe, quickly through the woods, you know, just get from A to B as quickly as we can, because the point is destination."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "Another kind of path is a path which is more like one that has a vistic view."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And in the spiritual life, both approaches are found in different kind of teachers."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And other teachers emphasize the path is something that we fulfill in every step, in every moment of mindfulness, every breath, in a sense, every moment that we wake up is a fulfillment of the path."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "But that suffering is camouflaged by the wonderful kind of engagement we might have with what it means to win the lottery."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And then if you extrapolate from that, in seeing it in yourself, to the fact that there's six billion people in the world, many of them whose minds function the same way, you realize the tremendous magnitude in which suffering exists in the world."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "Another way of saying it is freed people from the causes and conditions where we cause harm."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And the first of these steps is called right understanding or right view."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "You need a compass that directs you in the right direction."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And the Buddha's teaching was that the right orientation to have is that of understanding our life or having a framework for understanding our experience that is the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And the Four Noble Truths are simple in this way."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "The heart is innately happy or at peace, except it's covered by these attachments."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "To look at my life only through the filter of, am I suffering here or not? Is there a clinging here or is there not? Am I happy here or not? That's just, you know, but the answer to that is that sometimes having one very simple thing, the right thing, will draw everything to it that really needs being addressed in your life."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "So the suggestion here is that the Four Noble Truths are the watering hole of a spiritual life."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "It's about the size of maybe it's about eight feet by 12 feet."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And usually they have a little porch in front of it."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "The monastic life in Buddhism was not meant to be an ascetic life, very, potentially not meant to be ascetic."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "So once you kind of have found where the path is, then the next step in the Eighth Pole Path is right in tension."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And as we go through these Eighth Pole Steps, you'll find that some of the steps or some aspects of the steps have to do about acquiring something or building skills, building some understanding, and others have to do about letting go."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "So there has to be some motivation that gets you on the path, that gets you engaged."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "My girlfriend came to join me after some months in Kathmandu."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "We hardly had any money and all this stuff."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "But renunciation is very, very important part of being on the path."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "But if you really want to do one really well, it's hard to do all of them."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "I was very inspired, I won't say that."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And so once you have the orientation and find the path and you have the intention, then you have to step on, then you have to start walking on the path."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "You have to actually apply those attention."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "So if we're not mindful with our speech and careful with it, luck can get destroyed."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "Or you notice that you have a lot of anger towards someone."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "Some aspects it's quite easy to do this, and other aspects you can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "One of them can feel quite liberating is the ability to meet our experience without reaction, without judging, without being for or against it."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "A mind that doesn't waver, doesn't move when it sees something."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "And the cultivation of concentration, there's many ways of doing it, but it's a very important aspect of Buddhism because the deepest depths of our psyche that we want to address to really uproot clinging at the deepest point, there has to be a strong concentration to go there."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "An analogy is like flying a kite."}
{"prompt": "Eight Fold Path", "completion": "You can't be pulling it tight because if you pull too hard, I don't know, the string will break or somehow it just doesn't give enough movement up there for the wind to kind of do the glide with the wind."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (5 of 5) Aware but not Defined", "completion": "So I hope that this week on thinking and emotions has given you some new perspectives to really look at your life and look at yourself, understand yourself, that and certainly that's part of my hope was that you would, is to provide new perspectives that would be freeing, the new perspectives that would be useful to break out of old perspectives that maybe are not so helpful, so I hope it worked somewhat for that, and so thank you for this week, and then a couple of announcements, the I'll be going away next Thursday for to teach back East and East Coast at the Berry Center for Buddhist Studies, and I've become a little bit confused exactly about the substitutes coming to teach for me, and at some point in those two weeks Matthew Brensilver will come, and since I'm leaving on Thursday I might be able to be back the first days next week, and maybe Meg Gowler will teach the end, or something else will happen, I'm not quite sure these next two weeks, so please just to be aware that there's a certain unknown, at some point it'll be put in properly in the calendar, IMC calendar, and then a couple of things, announcements that maybe it's a little bit relevant for some of you, way back in the beginning of the year we did this series on the Satipatanasuta, the discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness, and I was struck by how meaningful the instructions were on the different parts of the body, the 32 parts of the body, 31 parts of the body meditation that we did a little bit, and the friend of mine is one of the, Bob Stahl is one of the, or probably the biggest proponent of this meditation practice in our Buddhist scene, and it does a lot of teaching of it, practiced it a lot, which is kind of a 32 parts of the body, kind of a systematic way of connecting to the body in a very deep way, it's a very important practice in Theravada Buddhism, so we invited him to come into a class can find his class there, I think it's maybe in September it starts, maybe it's an eight-week class, and I think there's information about the Sati Center programs on the What's New section of IMC's website, and the other thing that's happening in the beginning of October is I do a year-long programs for people who have fairly established practice and practicing for some time, and I think you have to have four years of practice and a number of retreats, silent vipassana retreats, but for those of you who have done that, you might be interested, it's one day a month for about eight, nine months, and this year the topic is meditation, and the program is called Deepening Meditation Practice, and you can read a little bit more about it in the, again, the What's New section of IMC's website, which is on the front page of IMC's website, the box on the bottom right, and there's applications for both programs, and so I think the applications for the Deepening Meditation Program is in September 1st."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "I would like to take today to talk about the Eightfold Path as kind of both as an introduction to the year-long series and also just it's a nice topic to talk about."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "So in this metaphor of the path, I think it points to a certain kind of understanding of what it requires from us, what it means to be engaged in a religious life."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "And so the king and queen, in fact, then go out there to see for themselves."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "So there's some understanding in the Buddha's mind, at least, that it's somehow inherent in human life, is that there is a path to walk, and that path has always been there, but it's forgotten, it's overgrown, and the Buddha just discovers it, he doesn't invent it."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "Now if you extend a little bit this metaphor, it would have used of the person who found the trail and going back to the king and queen, to tell them about the path, the king and queen here, almost explicitly, is you, is us."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "So the idea of being a king and queen is in royalty, of dignity, that you're actually going to walk this path with a degree of not, not, not as a scared little kid, not as, not as, as someone who is unworthy of it or incapable of it, but you're actually going to walk the path with a certain degree of dignity and ability, of royalty, that you're, you're really special, you are someone."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "So the idea of a king and queen is calling forth from us, some of our best qualities, of, in the best sense of the term, of self-possession, self-mastery, self, here I am, I'm going to walk this and stay balanced, let's do what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "And so you have to have, you know, some process of finding it."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "As you get ready to step on the path, just as you're going up into the woods and backpacking, you need to kind of reorient yourself, your attitude, your disposition, the kind of way you're disposed to go around, you know, life in your own living room, your television on, whatever, kind of is very different than how you need to be disposed as you walk in the woods."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "Some human mind is often caught up in greed and hate and wanting things and pushing things away."}

{"prompt": "Four Supports for Mindfulness Practice", "completion": "I want to thank also the volunteers who make it possible for us to be here in person at IMC and who make it possible for the recording and the YouTube stream."}
{"prompt": "Four Supports for Mindfulness Practice", "completion": "So I'll briefly mention them first before I dive deeper into each of them and the first might be familiar which is mindfulness and mindfulness is of course the ability to be aware of what is happening while it is happening and then the second support I'd like to talk about is relaxation because if we can relax a little bit in our often stressful lives this can be very helpful and I will give some tips and tools on how to do that and then the third support is kindness and I'd like to specifically focus on kindness towards ourselves because I think that's something that in our society is often difficult while it is vital for our well-being and then the fourth support will be return to the present moments so we all recognize when we are meditation we just go off lost in thoughts of past or future and just a simple reminder to be in a present moment can be very helpful so mindfulness relaxation kindness and returning to the present moments so first mindfulness the Buddha says in the suttas mindfulness is always useful so we can never go wrong by being mindful it's a very special quality of mind if you think about it because it really helps us to be aware of things we see what is happening while it is happening there's not really another aspect of our mind that can do that and mostly most people live in their lives without really knowing without really being present for what is here right now what is happening in our body and mind and we live mostly out of old patterns and conditionings and tendencies that we cultivated through our life in our childhood and later on in life without really knowing that we're doing that a simple example in my own life is that I used to like be super aversive towards cleaning like if I had to clean my house I was like oh I have to go clean again and it's really really needed again and I really don't want to do it and I was like days and days would build up like oh I really need to clean and I really don't want to and then when I was actually cleaning I was still aversive towards the cleaning I really want to do something else I really don't like this and true mindfulness practice I started recognizing that better enough aversion towards cleaning and I became aware of like oh maybe this is actually not so useful maybe this is actually painful to be aversive the whole time and I had to see it maybe like a hundred times before it started to shift a little bit towards like letting it go and being more present and just finding it a bit more neutral to clean and sometimes I now even like it sometimes it's even just a pleasant way of being mindful of the body so it can actually change so mindfulness can really help us to see all these old patterns these conditionings that we tend to live from and we might find very unhelpful unwholesome patterns and tendencies that are based on greed or aversion or delusion delusion sometimes also called confusion so it's very useful to keep an eye out for like oh is there any greed or wanting in the mind is there any aversion is there any confusion presence but we can also find very helpful and wholesome states of mind when we start being mindful like patterns that are based on generosity and compassion and wisdom so if we find those kind of patterns that is very useful to see because if we say for them if we acknowledge them then they strengthen and they become more so it's a very good thing to really acknowledge those kind of patterns and tendencies as well so as you understand probably this mindfulness Sati in Pali can really help us gain insight into our own minds insight into what is governing our lives those patterns and tendencies and maybe another super simple example is when we just start meditation then we find out like oh the mind thinks a lot I didn't know that like how much the mind is thinking so that's just just these tiny little simple things that we can notice and seeing these patterns is of course not always pleasant we we often see things that are not so pleasant but Sylvia Borstein is a meditation teacher she says mindfulness meditation doesn't change life life remains a fragile and unpredictable ever mindfulness meditation changes the heart's capacity to accept life as it is and so mindfulness can help us to grow this heart's capacity to be with both the pleasant and the unpleasant to really have the capacity to be with what is mindfulness itself is a non-judgmental presence for life for mindfulness it doesn't really matter what happens mindfulness itself doesn't have a judgment or doesn't need anything to be different than it is it's just seeing life as it is in this present moment so in a way we can learn to be not so reactive anymore and not necessarily want want things to change not necessarily want to push it away or pull it towards us but just to be there with it just to open to whatever it is however difficult it might be I do have to say that is it's a training it's not something that's like in an instant like we can do that sometimes we just need some time in this process so it can be useful to practice with easy things first and we don't start with the biggest thing in our life to open to that but to start with maybe something small like if someone cuts you on the highway and you feel anger coming up that you start with that anger or when you have an itch and during your meditation you you don't want to move so you feel the irritation of the itch that kind of thing might be useful and then slowly we will build some resilience and bit by bit we have more and more capacity to be with difficult things so patience is really important in this process really see it as a gradual learning process and I do want to say that we sometimes need to back off sometimes it's just overwhelming with what we experience and it's just too much and then it can be just really skillful to turn away from what we experience to to turn the attention away can be also very skillful and wholesome at times that doesn't important side note to what I'm saying but in the cases that it's not overwhelming and super difficult then when we do open to difficulty then to help us get a little bit motivated we could ask ourselves like do we want to live in ignorance or do we want to know what's happening even if it's maybe not so pleasant because only when we know what is happening can we change it and can we work towards a more wholesome way of living with a bit less reactivity maybe so when we know we can start to learn from it and gain wisdom and we can practice this knowing of what is happening both in formal meditation as well as in our daily lives and especially in daily life we can see those patterns and conditionings that that govern our day our lives and our activities and we can see simple things maybe like craving for coffee in the morning or that we see that when we say hello to our neighbor and that it's actually coming from our kind heart or we see the change of mood during the day from energized to down to at ease to stressed we can see all sorts of interesting things so when we start to see more and more know more and more about our own minds and hearts then we start to develop more and more wisdom and skillfulness in our lives and one of my teachers say no rotation he talks about that there's this wisdom part in the mind that wisdom is like this separate part in the mind just like like anger and love they're all like little entities in itself in the mind and then those can grow or weakened hopefully with anger for example and then when we start to see things with mindfulness then the wisdom part of our minds can start to learn from that and one way of learning would be that what we see and what we're gonna see is that what leads to happiness and freedom and peace and what leads to suffering and that's a very important thing to start seeing like what I realized with the cleaning that my response of being super aversive towards cleaning was actually not leading to happiness but was contributing to more and more suffering in my life so we start to see the painful habits and then start to let go of it because wisdom starts to start to let go of his wisdom is the is the part of the mind that can let go it's not us that let's go let's go so we don't necessarily meditate to get rid of a problem but a more helpful way to see is that we meditate to start to understand and to learn and to gain wisdom so and this way you can make mindfulness your whole your whole pot your your whole life becomes your pot because it becomes this fertile ground for wisdom that's what I wanted to say about mindfulness and then the second second support I'd like to talk about is relaxation maybe you recognize that sometimes you sit down for relaxation for mindfulness or for meditation and you just sit there and you do your thing but you don't really start anywhere you just sit there so what often is very helpful is when we have a little bit of a beginning when we start our meditation and one of the things we can do to start would be to relax because when we deliberately relax then it will condition the next moment and next moment so every moment conditions the next moment so if we deliberately relax then that helps us in our meditation so we can also relax during daily life we don't have to wait till we sit down for meditation anytime you think about it you can relax like when you drive to work or when you're in the bathroom or when you're eating whenever you think about it but how do we do that how do we relax like the first easy thing to do is to relax the body because the body and the mind are connected so if you consciously relax your body then it will affect your mind as well and one way to relax the body is to do a body scan so you just go through the body and just touch on with your attention on each part of the body and often this little bit of attention for the body already relaxes the body and sometimes direct invitation to the body helps the body to relax so you can say may the body relax or if we have certain tensions in certain parts of the body we can we can invite those parts to relax like the shoulders maybe the forehead or the little muscles around the eye sometimes get get tense and sometimes just breathing in and out a bit deeper a few times can really relax as well and we can also work with the mind to relax and the simplest way is again an invitation you can say oh may the mind relax and see if that does anything sometimes it will sometimes it won't because what relaxation is actually what it actually is is an absence of unwholesome mind states so when we experience those unwholesome roots for example greed wanting a version delusion confusion that I was talking about earlier these cause all sorts of unwholesome mind states to arise like wanting attachment frustration despair sadness fear anger whatever it is that we experience if we experience any of those kind of mind states then relaxation becomes a bit harder because when these mind states subsides then relaxation will automatically follow so relaxation is about the absence of desire or a version or confusion so any time you find yourself being not relaxed you could ask yourself like oh is there maybe desire a version or confusion present right now is is there anything I want different right now because if we're in contention with reality it's really hard to relax so when I was feeling tense about the cleaning I couldn't relax you know I was feeling tense I was a versus I or you know you you feel your whole body contracting and then when that lets go then there can be a relaxation and there can be an ease in it in the cleaning and that's a whole process of course it's not that when once we recognize oh oh I'm a versus or or I'm stressful that it let's go immediately sometimes it does sometimes just a simple recognition is enough but sometimes it doesn't sometimes we need to see those patterns like over and over again just a recognizing of it is it's the first step and this of course ties back into the mindfulness and recognizing of what's happening is mindfulness so mindfulness is the basis for the relaxation in a way you can say so with mindfulness we can start to recognize like we can also start to see like oh I am not relaxed right now and indeed there is a version or one thing maybe in the mind or you can see oh I'm actually really relaxed and the mind is pretty wholesome right now you can see start to see that those things are related connected so that's what I wanted to say about relaxation and then the third support is kindness so as I said I'd like to talk about kindness towards ourselves even though kindness towards others is very useful and wholesome of course so fantastic also to practice kindness towards others but I think for a lot of people here in the West yeah kindness for ourselves is a bit underdeveloped like many of us are you know somewhat unkind towards ourselves we experience self-judgment or self-hatred or or self-loathing things can be pretty strong patterns of the mind and the Buddha says hatred never ends with hatred by love alone it ends this is an ancient truth so sometimes we try to overcome this patterns of self-judgment or self-hatred with hatred like oh I don't want this pattern I it needs to go away but it doesn't really work because then we're trying to end our hatred with hatred and hatred is a little bit of a strong word a version is kind of a milder form of hatred you could say so these patterns we can actually overcome by kindness kindness towards ourselves I would say that developing this this kindness for ourselves is actually for Westerners often a fast track to more ease and more peace in our lives and I do admit it's not easy to develop this it can be it can be quite a challenge especially because these patterns can be of for example self-judgment can be very strong but we all are somewhere in our practice and we all have to start somewhere so even if it's not easy and a lot of those kind of patterns come up it's still worth it to incrementally try to practice this I think that trying to cultivate the kindness will be beneficial for almost anyone even if you already feel kind to your towards yourself you can always practice a little bit more and if you imagine being kind to yourself how that influence like every aspect of your life and there are several ways to do this to practice this kindness towards ourselves and the first one is very simple that it would be just a simple intention so we can have the intention to be kind just the intention to cultivate kindness because intention shapes shapes our mind and shapes the next moment in the next moment what I said with the conditionings of the moments so it's a very powerful tool I can use that in all sorts of settings not only with kindness but it can be very strong a strong way to cultivate it because the mind will start to direct us in that direction even though we might be miles away from kindness right now it will give us just a direct interaction it's like trying to launch those big big tinker ships trying to to change the course you know you might not might not notice it much in the beginning but every tiny bit that you pull on the wheel is going to going to have an effect in the long run so intention we can use intention and then the second way we can develop kindness is through using what is called metta meditation and then metta is one of the Brahma viharas the heavenly abodes that's translated as loving kindness meditation and I think most of you are probably familiar with metta meditation but just to sum it up it's it's a Buddhist meditation form that uses phrases to generate this hard quality of loving kindness so we would express phrases not out loud but just in the mind like a wish for ourselves for example may I be happy or may I live with ease maybe healthy and what I said about relaxation we can start with relaxation if we do our meditation we could also start with kindness that is a choice I mean you don't have to know everything but sometimes you can maybe start with relaxation sometimes you can start with some metta practice with some wishes for yourself and you can even try this in your daily life like also whenever you think about it use a phrase may I be happy may I live with ease I use it a lot during my daily life just when I feel a little bit down or something I just realized oh I can do a little bit of metta for myself just a few phrases and it sometimes just lightens the heart out right away it's not like an instant an instant cure for everything but it can sometimes just give us a little bit more light in the heart whenever we need it and then the third way to cultivate kindness would be to pay attention to when we are kind to ourselves and when we are not kind to ourselves so it's also would require some mindfulness so being mindful of body and mind state of mind and also this is a learning process we can learn and grow from those moments that we are not kind to ourselves and we can see those moments over and over and over again and we start to recognize the patterns that it that it comes from and the mind might start to realize at some point that it's not that great to experience unkindness towards ourselves the mind start to realize that it's painful and unpleasant and that's what I said about gaining wisdom this the mind recognizing that it's painful is wisdom at work and if wisdom if wisdom starts to grow then it might at some point steadily slowly let go of these patterns or just a little bit here and there so wisdom can really work in the background it's not something that we would easily see for like it's like with that big big tanker ship like only when we are way down down the road down the road not really a road but are we way down our path we see at some point oh we've actually steered so much in the in the wholesome direction now I start to see that my part actually changed compared to where I came from it is something that that can be a very slow process but at some point we might see some effects can be weeks can be months can be years so an example that Sharon Salzburg gives she's a meta meta meta teacher a personal teacher as well but she does a lot with meta and she describes in her book on loving kindness that she once was on a retreat so long retreats and she was doing only meta only meta for herself and during that retreat after some weeks or a month or so I don't remember she she got a message that something was wrong at home so she needed to leave the retreat early and she didn't feel any meta that she had like set all these weeks for for nothing she taught because she didn't feel anything and just as meta practice was just not working for her she was thinking so she was packing her stuff and she dropped a bottle and it just shattered all over the floor and her thought was something like it's okay dear and she realized wow meta meta just came up for myself and she just like before her retreat she would never have taught anything like that but now the meta even if she didn't notice anything during the practice it had worked somehow so we never know what happens in the background when we practice is kindness for ourselves maybe at some point we have a kind thought too and of course we can be aware of those moments that were unkind or towards ourselves but it's also very important to see those moments that we are kind towards ourselves and really take those moments in really savor the moments because if we savor it but any wholesome states also with kindness we really reinforce that state of mind when we really really enjoy it and feel it then it can can grow more and that's not an ego trip at all it's actually the building of a healthy self and we kind of need a healthy sense of self before we can let go of ourselves I can Buddhism we talk about all the not self aspect of life but yes we need a healthy sense of self before we kind of can let go of ourselves so this kindness towards ourselves is actually contributing to to this aspect as well of not self it's very both beneficial for wholesome and free life so that was what I wanted to say about the kindness and then we get to the last support for our practice for today which is to return to the present moment or go to Buddha again don't chase the past or long for the future the past is left behind the future is not yet reached right where it is have insight into whatever experience appears and quote like how much of our lives do we spend not in the present moment how much of our lives are we off into daydreaming about the future or worrying about the future planning or we're ruminating about the past thinking about this fun vacation that we had some years ago or this difficult conversation we had yesterday or whatever it is and of course we do need to think about the future we do need to make plans like else we wouldn't all be here we wouldn't have turned the computer on to look at the Dharma talk and so there is some use in you know thinking about the future or the past but often like a big chunk of the time that we are lost in future or past it's just this habit pattern of thinking thinking thinking but it doesn't really contribute much to our lives so being in the present moment and really experiencing this moment like what's happening right now in the body what's happening right now in the mind can be very skillful and can be very grounding and stabilizing and if you think about it like is there anything do you ever get anything else than this present moment not really right we always get only this moment and this one and this one our lives is just this flow of present moments everlasting present moments even if we plan for the future or if we think about the past or worry or want something or have a version towards something in the past or in the future and the only thing we have is is those worries or wants or feelings or thoughts in the present moment and it's even if you think like oh I want like let's say I want a pizza right now like you never gonna get that pizza in this present moment it's always a wanting to get something in the future once you get it it's not this wanting anymore of this moment that makes sense so it's important to recognize that we can't really escape this present moment even though we're off in thoughts and about future of past and this returning to the present moment is also a simple recognition like oh I was gone I was lost in the thoughts about the future of the past so it's also involves mindfulness again and often when we recognize that we are already back in the present moment and next to that we just see oh I was gone and now I'm back we can also more actively tune back into this present moment like we can check into what the body is right now like oh it's like this right now there's maybe some tension here or there's some softness there or some bar and or whatever it is and we can tune actively into what's happening in the mind and it doesn't have to be like this big elaborate investigation it can just be a tiny moment in our daily lives or if we're meditating then we might do it a little bit more elaborately tune back in the present moment and try to stay there but in our daily lives it might be just a moment like oh yeah the body is like this right now or the mind is like this you could try it even right now when I'm talking to tune into the body tune into the mind present moment sensations recognizing it's like this right now so that's what I wanted to say about the returning to the present moment and like what you can see throughout all these supports is that mindfulness is actually the basis for the other three supports so we need mindfulness to recognize is there any stress present is there an unwholesome mind state present or do I need to relax a little bit more the first the first support to relax or mindfulness can recognize are we kind towards ourselves or is there some harsh harshness or judgements in our minds and mindfulness can help us to learn from these patterns and tendencies of harshness or judgment and maybe eventually let go and and cultivate some kindness and mindfulness can recognize if we're off into future or past we can help us remember to return to this present moment so if you have bandwidth for only one of those four supports then you can pick mindfulness because then you cover all of them basically and mindfulness is always useful as the Buddha says so but you can also pick and choose or see which one resonates most with you right now which one you feel like would be beneficial right now or what I do is I've written them down I use a digital notebook and they're there when every time I open that notebook they're there clearly there and I see them like struggle times a day and then I remind then it reminds me like oh yeah right I was supposed to be mindful or I take this conscious moment to relax the body and if it lacks the mind I invite the body and the mind to relax or check in is there any aversion or the tension present or then I see the kindness reminder and like oh yeah I supposed to be kind toward myself let's cultivate a little bit of kindness and sometimes I'm really stressed out and you know my to-do list is right there and I'm like oh I have need to all these things and like oh yeah kindness oh yeah I can be kind towards myself or I consciously return to the present moment seeing that reminder like oh yeah I only have to take care of this moment and then this moment I don't have to think about like four weeks from now just this moment and of course there are many other supports that we can use for our lives and our meditation practice these are just four that I came up with that were very helpful and useful for me and some other support that you can think of might be like the other Brahmavihara's compassion joy equanimity maybe support like acceptance or patience or impermanence might be useful and so we all have different conditionings different habits patterns and tendencies and we all need different types of supports in different times so we don't have to be attached to the four that I talked about today yeah I just wanted to share that they've been helpful for me and how they can be helpful for you maybe as well so the invitation is to discover for yourself what is supported for you in your practice in your life and that might change over time as well I'd like to end with a poem by the poet and teacher Kaveri Patel and the poem is called dare you dare you you always have so many things to do so many places to be your mind spinning like fan blades at high speed each moment always a blur because you're never still I know you're tired I also know it's not your fault a constant brain bus is like a swarm of bees threatening to sting if you close your eyes you've forgotten something again you need to prepare for that or else you should have done that differently what if you closed your eyes would the world fall apart without you or would your mind become the open sky flock of dots flying across the sunrise as you just watched and smiled thank you for your kind attention thank you and yeah it's about time so I'll stay here in case there's any questions but otherwise there's you're free to go."}

{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "In fact, I think quite often it is the case that, you know, I'm right and I'm sure I'm right."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So, you know, there's a certain sense of solidity and a pseudo strength that comes from holding a position of being right and standing behind my position."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "There's separation, alienation."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And it takes us to the same place."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then we come and meditate and try to connect with our true nature."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then seeing that there's the arising, the kind of positioning, and creating and defending of this me."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Well, maybe sometimes they are actually, but they just don't feel like they are."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "But then there's the really, really big ones that you don't want to get into the really, really big ones."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's all about the feelings that arise here in this mind, in this heart mind, and how we relate to those feelings."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "But the practice isn't about becoming a really good, lovely, perfect person."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's like, you know, we're mendicants, we don't have any money at all of our own."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then we walk and through that people are fed or they have better farming implements so they can make better food or they learn about the importance of breastfeeding, say women in Africa."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Sadly, this is very strong in Theravada countries, interestingly enough."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So it's not just about giving a bag of food but it's about helping people get back on their feet."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I'd really like to invite you to look and investigate in your lives where that arises, the many places that that arises, and not with a judgment, not with like, oh, I shouldn't be doing that, oh, I should be doing that again, because that's just another self arising, that's just another attachment and identification."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "You'll probably be much more present and responsive and clear than you were when you were coming from a place of me and mine."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And part of that and another aspect of that is I can feel my mind trying to grasp, what does that even mean? And then I get into this loop of, okay, but what is the being that is asking that question and it just gets really circular."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So there's the kind of obvious things of like once you were just a few cells in your mother's womb and then you're a little baby and then a few things in between."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "That's not going to go away."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "But there's something going on there that isn't open-hearted and isn't flowing."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So you don't have to give."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "We have patterns of ways we relate in the world and then they keep bringing us to the same place."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's a bit difficult for me because I don't really know the situation and if they might be totally dependent on you, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And it can also be that we see ourselves as the giver and there's a certain."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Like who am I going to be if I'm not in that position? There can be that too."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then slices it into hundreds of slices and makes breakfast to give out to people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "There's more calm, the ability to see and distinguish."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "Oh, there's some pleasantness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "It's all going back and forth."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "So it takes some practice and settling the mind to be able to see these distinguishings."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "So let me put up for you to see the Wheel of Dependent Origination."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "Dependent arising is a long and often complicated teaching and much longer for the minutes that we have left."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "It's not interested in our happiness or unhappiness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "If somebody says something a little critical, you'll remember it for the rest of your life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "There is also this bias of not realizing, not noticing, not noticing the Vedana when it comes up and just shortcut to reaction."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "I don't like what this person said in the reactiveness."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And so I just thought I would reflect a little bit on what the Buddha has to say about conflict and maybe some of the teachings that might be supportive for us at this time."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And one of the suttas where this comes up is actually called the Exposition on Non-Conflict."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And that experience, that difference gives us a sense of what the difference is between conflict and non-conflict."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "It's kind of interesting to hear the Buddha say something like, the state of conflict is the wrong way, and then to have the teaching be, just know that you're going the wrong way."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "I mean, sometimes it doesn't feel small, but it is kind of just like almost a quarter turn of the mind to see it clearly and know that that's what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And maybe let's just think about two people right now."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "Being aware internally is being aware of our own processes, our own bodies, our own minds."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "Being aware externally, the understanding of that is that you're aware of the bodies and minds of others."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "Which, you know, maybe, I don't know, you know, again, it's not really clear what it means."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "There was a lot of complex conditioning that was seen in that."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "It is just a state of mind that arises based on conditions."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And so likewise, the conflict that arises between two people, it's not self."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "It is created based on the conditions of these two people, these two conditionings coming together and influencing each other."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And so you can kind of read the variety of, of how people say things and see even, you know, a single word in a, in a headline, how that skews the meaning, you know, and so you can get a sense of, oh, okay, you know, so you really can get a different take on, on the news."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And so this, this dictionary kind of highlights particular words that may not have the same meaning for people."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "What five? It is spoken at the proper time."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "I just kind of noticed this today, the two different words."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "So what is said needs to be true and beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "It doesn't say that what is said needs to be agreeable to the other person."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Diana will try to weave this together."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "If you would say a word or a very phrase, how are you this morning? I don't know is a fine thing to share also, or confused, or whatever it might come."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Friendliness, metta, friendliness, goodwill, for exactly how your heart is right now, in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And when there is stability in your heart, then maybe turning back, if it feels appropriate to your beloved person, your easy person."}

{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I like to model taking care of body today."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It's part of our expression of care."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Ah, so your spine is straightening without you even trying."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And let yourself be surprised as you continue to land, land more deeply."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Let go of more and more tension as if the cells of your body are opening up, freeing up, giving up, offering up."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And groundedness and stability and spaciousness and peace."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Just sitting and breathing in order to have more stability, groundedness, spaciousness, to be available for yourself and for the world, taking this moment away from the world, this moment of refuge in the body, in the breath."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And receiving, receiving each in breath and out breath as a friend, as a soothing lullaby, receiving the sensations of the breath, in the body, the framework of the body, maybe in the abdomen today, just so that it helps you settle in ground, more deeply into your sit bones, or maybe feeling, receiving the movement, the joyous movement of the breath throughout the body, through all the way through your feet, your hands, and your face."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And from this space of stability, from this place of groundedness, as much groundedness as there is this place of refuge, having established this first, as much as possible, as much as available this morning, turning our minds, our hearts, to care, to friendliness and goodwill, and to support, to prime the heart, invite you to bring to mind someone to whom you care, someone to whom you have goodwill, friendliness, care, meta, love, kindness."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Maybe it's just a sense of connection that you have with this being, a sense of recognition."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "May you be healthy and strong."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And may your life flow with ease."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I wish you ease, I wish you peace with your difficulty, with your challenge in the midst of this."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Diana, would you like to do the groups? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Kind of get grounded and let go some of our attention."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And then just a recognition that this person, this being, or perhaps some other beings, maybe having some challenges, some difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So now we'd like to open it up that you can have a conversation amongst just a small group of you, maybe three or four."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And then if there's time to go back around again, maybe something that somebody said reminded you of something or helped you to touch into experience that you had, and you might have something else that you'd like to say."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So Nikki, I think has been setting us up and I can't help, but I always get a thrill out of this, that we're going to magically find ourselves in groups, small groups, probably three or four."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I met two women from Calgary who happened to be in the same sangha and by chance they were in the same group."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "We'll get to you in a second."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And I've seen there's somebody from Berlin."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And I entered this room like a half hour after you guys were already sitting."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "That distancing thing almost feels like I'm being ostracized."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "You know, that's what goes on in my head."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And so I found it very, very sweet to be able to just sit with a bunch of people and listen and participate."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And so how not to, so then I wouldn't call that compassion, but perhaps if I may, I will reformulate your question and, oh, how do I do the practice of compassion by letting the soothing and comforting and not fall into empathic distress? Because my mind, my heart has a tendency, can do that because I feel the pain of others so much."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So if you're contemplating somebody else's pain, ooh, ouch, it feels like you are in pain yourself, okay? So had him do this practice, brought Matthew Ricard out of the fMRI machine, and he says, oh, I feel so terrible, please put me back in."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And he says, ah, thank you, Tanya, I feel better now, I feel balanced."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "If you find yourself in overwhelm, you can always get grounded back in the body."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So whether you experience it more as a felt sense like a bodily experience warm heartedness a certain amount of ease spaciousness, or if it feels more like a mental thing that it's having nice thoughts or good will that thinking pleasant things are about somebody, or maybe it's a combination of both is perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So then Nikki maybe you'd like to add to that and I liked what you said."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And he said, you know, first you say the phrases, then you conceptualize meta and then yes, some sort of something else arises."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It might actually arise as a perspective for you or as a shift in action or in the way you are in the world or the way you see the world."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So it can show up in different ways, really."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And as a change of perspective for some people."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Other quickly, can you evoke a person who's deceased as either, as one of the people that comes to mind when you're saying that phrase? Very quickly, yes, you can, but we don't recommend it until you are a lot more stable in the practice."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Maybe five, even 10 steps."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I see an acknowledged solely taking care of her body today and doing lying meditation, which is perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Let's do it for, I'm going to make it sure."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Diana, let's discuss in real time so that we don't fall too behind."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And that the importance of allowing our positive emotions like meta, like loving kindness and compassion to flourish."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "For some people it's easier to start with a dear one."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Why not just give it a shot or try it out for this little bit here? When you notice the self-critic, the inner critic arising, can you maybe like bow to it, literally or figuratively, and say, I see you."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So with that as an introduction, we'd like to bring yourself, I'll start a guided meditation, bring yourself to an alert upright posture that also expresses care, that also expresses self-care."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Can you sit and know you're sitting? Nothing in particular needs to be happening."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "If there is a sense of warmth and openness, and it's perfectly fine if there isn't, but if there is, you can allow that to support you, nourish you, nurture you, even if it's just a tiny part of your experience."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It comes from a place of warm heartedness, from love."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "There's, of course, it's enormously helpful and supportive to be doing meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "We might see it when it arises when we see somebody who needs some help or when we touch into when we're on the phone talking to family members or friends."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "The loving kindness and compassion for the dear ones made me very tearful."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So maybe at the personal level, it kind of turns into some kind of a self pity."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Nikki, would you like to answer that? Sure, I'll start."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And my saying your name right, Nevin or Nikki? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, like feeling it that way would be helpful."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I don't have anything to add."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, this is a good question."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "You forget to stay close to yourself so that you can stay close to people that are in your life and that you care about."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And what happens when you lose this heart and you start neglecting other people that give you so much."}

{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So when we started off by focusing on someone we have a lot of love for, I focused on one of my nephews."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I live with somebody who were very different and just our natural ways of being sometimes clash, and I feel, and our ways of responding to this, the COVID also, the COVID-19."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "But it was easy to have compassion for myself in that."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "The parts that we love and the parts that we don't really, we want to exercise and leave it away."}

{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So just tune into when these experiences naturally arise, feel them in the body, tune into how they feel in the mind and that just makes it more likely that they will arise again."}

{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "But what is it? What in the world is it? How do we know it when we see it? Do you know what your mind is? Maybe you know it, but you can't explain what it is."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And then someone comes along, a well-meaning person, says, you know, by the way, it's not really required to have his life grip on each other's hands."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So they think that's a good idea, so they do it."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And so their hands now are liberated from each other."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And how is a mind known if it's not clinging to anything? It's not like a fist, a hand, which physically you can see, oh, the sign of a hand released, the fist is open."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "He said, when someone becomes totally liberated, there's these certain beings like gods and Mara and devilish characters who can apparently read people's minds."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So it's possible you'll go home today, and on the way there you'll run into someone who maybe has a flat tire or something and you seem like clearly that they're in trouble."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "That seems like, of course, that's where the great matter is."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And so involved in what they're aware of, they're not aware of themselves being aware."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So I might be really concerned with, you know, almost anything, but I might be really concerned about where am I going to get dinner tonight? Is there going to be any dinner for me? Any food? How do I find it? Is it raining? How do I get about? How do I deal with dinner? And dinner is maybe a survival thing."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And I'm so involved in the dinner thoughts that I'm not thinking at all."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "One of the things we can be preoccupied by is our physical discomfort in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It's not like a major show."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So I hope that gives you an idea that we often get, you know, we're concerned with what we know, not the knowing itself."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It's contracted, it's scattered, it's fragmented, it's tired, it's dull, it's bright, it's sharp, it's expansive, it's open."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "Buddha talked about unrestricted mind versus a restricted mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "To know whether it's a concentrated mind or an un-concentrated mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And so just let go, let go, let go."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "My mind just was not working."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "They have to institutionalize me."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It's actually vibrant and full and capable to participate."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And there's a story of him going, showing up at the capital at the emperor, where the emperor had an audience with the emperor."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "He probably had let go of a lot of things already."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So the chitta, the mind, a very interesting thing that we have, don't have, can't find."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "How does it help us to become happier? And the promise of the Buddha is that we can, in his exploration he was looking for, is it possible for us to be free from suffering and his own discovery, in his own discovery he says that it is possible for us to be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this, what I'd like to explore tonight is how this path that we've been discussing, wise view, wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration, these tools, these practices of the Eightfold Path, how they help us to find our way towards letting go of greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There are two different things that I've heard it described about."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so that is the meaning of the word to be released, to be cooled."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Often we may express it in harsh language or do things that, especially if we're relating in relationship to somebody, somebody that we don't like, we may say things to them that hurt them."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so in a way, because of that belief in that delusion and the kind of projecting into the fantasy of having the thing, we actually miss that the experience of greed in and of itself is suffering."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And the delusion that's there is just that."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so he describes that when lust, anger, and delusion are given up, one experiences no mental pain and grief."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Again, it might seem hard to fathom."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so what might it be? What might it mean? Even at that deep level of losing a dear one and not experiencing grief."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So that understanding is where we begin."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "We've talked about the Eightfold Path and it's got these different sections of the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There's the first two, which are kind of the beginning, the wisdom, the orientation towards what a different way of understanding our experience and understanding how things happen in our lives, this whole orientation."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this is that part of the path that begins to address how the greed, the aversion, and delusion might be affecting other people."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And then the third section of the path, the mental cultivation section that includes wise effortfulness and wise concentration, helps to support how we see that experience internally."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "When I talked about greed, aversion, and delusion arising inside and not expressing outside, but we still suffer inside when greed arises, when aversion arises in our hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so if we think about how our greed, aversion, and delusion express themselves, they express themselves sometimes through acting out."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so that's one way, one level of how greed, aversion, and delusion express themselves, is in our relationships."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There is a pain that is suffering in and of itself in our own hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "These kinds of suggestions in this section of the path are actions, activities of body and speech that the Buddha suggests useful to not engage with these, because generally when we engage in these, we are acting out of greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "In my way, I understood the Christian tradition, and maybe I was just misunderstanding it, I don't know, but this was how I understood it in my Christian upbringing, was that you just don't do them."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's like, okay, anything that I just don't do it."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And both of those habitual relationships tend to reinforce the quality itself."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's essentially digging those grooves deeper, those ruts that I talked about earlier, the kind of ruts in our mind, that as we express or as we follow through or believe that following through those energies is going to help us in some way, we are reinforcing that pattern."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That's kind of what our mindfulness allows us to do, to hold that pattern in a way."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That getting something that I want is the way to happiness."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this is what we see as we turn with our experience, turn with mindfulness towards our experience, we see that all of our experience is changing."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "They start just some small thing, and then they grow and change."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And every year they are changing."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "One common view in our culture is that happiness comes from an accumulation of status or wealth, or that happiness comes from being able to control our environment to create what we'd like, to create the situation that we'd like."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "When we manage to accumulate things, you know, we may be happy in that accumulation."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So the right view of the Eightfold Path, I've talked about various aspects of right view over the last few times I spoke, but I'm just going to highlight two of them."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So this is a really radical shift in our idea of how happiness can come to us."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And as we see the suffering in our own lives, the dissatisfaction, the unease, the frustration, that results from these mistaken views, and we see that everyone is subject to the same kind of suffering, and if compassion begins to arise, we see that it's heartbreaking to see how misunderstood people are, and the impact that that has on the world, and on the way we treat our fellow human beings."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So it can really bring a sense of compassion and kindness towards others, and intention towards compassion and kindness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Somebody had sent me a book, and it's like, well, here's a teaching."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And again, this is not something that makes a lot of sense to us."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "You know, we get what we want and we have a desire for some kind of sense gratification and we get what we want and we experience some happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "It's a different kind of happiness than of having what we want."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So that kind of justification is one aspect."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "We recognize it as being something that's off in a way."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "I thought about this person who was like a volcano exploding that this anger would arise."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And the first few split seconds of that emotion, mostly when it was fully blown, it had the sense of pressure and heat."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And the third kind of intention is the intention towards harmlessness, towards compassion."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "I saw that kind of multiply by six billion."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "If I were in Afghanistan, if I'd grown up in Afghanistan, you know, it's hard to say."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So that's the kind of thought that we use to incline our minds towards compassion, bringing someone to mind and recollecting some suffering they may be experiencing and wishing, may you be free from that suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So turning our thoughts in the direction of renunciation, kindness, and compassion begins to put ourselves into alignment with the truth, with freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Now anger, we don't always just simply with anger say, oh, anger, I'm not going to take any action."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "I found that often with these emotions, there's unwholesome and wholesome motivations both tied together."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Energy", "completion": "Just try to soften around it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Energy", "completion": "There's no need to judge the wandering mind."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "So instead of leading into frustration of oh, it just doesn't make sense with just dropping the question in living the question with patients, trusting that the practice builds up and it will make sense."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "The structure of the Satipattana Sutta, especially if you have been just joined today and you're not quite sure where we are."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "Okay, so not possible to share it in chat."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "Oh, well, maybe what I'll do is I will read the entire refrain."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "Now, the second sentence, you see how these build up together, build up, the second that we worked with a couple of days ago, with contemplating the nature of arising and passing away."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So, what do you say after Indian production like that? There's, of course, many things are popping up in my mind as appropriate to follow up on."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "But then it's also, it's as manifest here, learning how to, to take the opportunity to, to give so that it's a benefit of, to others."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And, and it really is us of, of the, I think, just in the human condition and us as meditators of the, and certainly myself as beginning practice of really thinking, you know, when I get my meditation together, I'm going to be happy."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And I, I used it, used the theme of, of a cartoon that the assistant abbot, Geniatiko, just got from his mother."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that, that's important."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that, yeah, in a place like this, in a retreat center and just keeping, and people keeping their eyes open and making sure that SEP fields aren't, aren't, aren't sort of coming into being in different places."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And when, when that's taken as a training, then you start seeing, oh, I, I, I give to the training."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And, and it isn't, it isn't stable either."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that was like one, the first, very first time that Ajahn Chah went to, went to England."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "The monk should wander mindfully for the overcoming of identity view."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "But it's that, that, that, that kind of slipping into the identification that is the problem."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And because it sets oneself up for, for separation from the, from, from what one has perceived as reality."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And there's a discourse where the Buddha points to a, there's a, there's a certain principle that the Buddha talks about in many places, which is in, in the scriptural language is that dhamma-nu-dhamma-patibhata, practicing dhamma in accordance with dhamma."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that, that in itself is a kind of a, a mouthful to, to reflect on."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "It's not, not, not, and it's not anywhere else."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And so that one of the things that, that is commonly used in, in Thailand for, for drinking water is to have these big earthen jars and collect rainwater, which you then use through the year, which is great rainwater is very pure."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "I mean, that sort of, it comes from, you know, there's a certain clarity, a willingness to sort of give up one's own kind of, because everybody, you know, everybody wants to be comfortable, not have to do much."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "It's sort of like, oh, yeah, this is how to act with integrity."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "There's a really great example of that with Master Xu Yun, who was a very revered Chinese monk from the last century into the middle."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And it was in the period of kind of the conflict between the nationalists and the communists and a lot of instability in the country."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "He said, reverend or venerable, we're sorry we don't want to kind of inconvenience you, but this is kind of, it's not great conduct, but that's what we're about these days."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "Because I think there are certain equations that we follow."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "There are assumptions to be reflected on."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "I mean, that's the nature of the Buddha's path, that there are these loops going around."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "Just starting in any place where it makes sense."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So I'll take leave of you all and enjoy the rest of your retreat."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Everything Is Allowed", "completion": "And perhaps, for some of you, it is simply receiving the next most obvious thing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Everything Is Allowed", "completion": "We can allow resistance to be what is here."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And then what is here, the heart that's not resistant will kind of have these different flavors depending on what's here."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And then that heart-open quality of connected care, when there is suffering happening, that heart will be touched with compassion, this quivering and this wish to alleviate that suffering, that movement of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And when there is what's happening is something that's delightful or joyful, the heart resonates with that."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "The word sympathetic there is resonant with the word sympathetic in music, sympathetic vibration in music, where when you pluck a string on a stringed instrument, you get some overtones as that string resonates and gently, subtly vibrates the string next to it."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And there are, it's such a difficult year in so many ways that there will be times for all of us, who's not fully awakened probably, we'll slip into that fear, confusion, anxiety, get caught up in reactivity and not have that balance."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And that brings in both the qualities right there, both the qualities of equanimity and love."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "It has to do with, it connects to something that you helped me with almost a year ago now at the last in-person retreat at Cloud Mountain."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "It's an odd feeling sometimes that sensation in the heart when both are there."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "And, and that also is not helpful and it's, it's, it's certainly on the, you know, certainly delusional and it's certainly on the whichever side it was, that's not the good wishes."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "Yeah, thank you for sharing the joy that you had seeing the airplane."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "I think it was a 90 year old lady in London got the first vaccine."}
{"prompt": "Joy and Heartbreak", "completion": "Hopefully I'm getting tenderized."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And so, if we're lucky, just enough of the clouds part or the fog settles, and so the top of the mountain is exposed."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "They can also create tremendous amount of problems for us, and stress for us, and preoccupation in us."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And we can identify very strongly with them, and sometimes the thinking world is, we believe we are our thoughts, or thoughts and me are the same."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "So how do we stop? So if we take this word stop and use it as an acronym, then I'd like to suggest that four steps."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "There's a seeing to see, and then there's tasting, and then there's opening, and then there's being a peace with what's there."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And we should do more of this, and I recognize that the sky is blue, but I'm kind of in the sky, in the thoughts of it all that."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "Can you see the difference? So it might seem kind of cold, clinical, removed, to say oh the sky is blue, it's a blue."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And what we're trying to learn is not only to see what's there, we're also learning to see in a new way."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "It's beautiful pastures with beautiful flowers."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "If we don't stop, we swirl and we kind of generating more and more clouds and fog."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "So if you feel dismayed or overwhelmed by what's happening in the country, then if it's not too overwhelming, the idea is once you recognize it and see it, once we get a fuller experience of it, where it is in the body, how it's experienced, what's going on for us, it's a step towards it to feel it more fully, kind of open to feel it more."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "Maybe the mountain has lots of caves, dark caves, secret caves, caves with treasure, caves with demons, caves with traps, caves with, you know, all kinds of things in your caves."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "We want a whole mountain to be seen."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "So there's a lot more than just stopping."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "So with all the hate that's in this country, I'm pretty confident that if we hate in return, it makes more clouds, worse."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "But if we can learn to stop with all the different things going on with us around this, and learn how, in a certain way, find our peace with it, in a wise way, find our peace with ourselves and everything, then we're in a much better place to try to do something, to change something, to come and respond."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "Because we need to respond in some way."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "We want to be wonderful changing agents to make this world a better place and create the conditions for less hate to be here."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "But maybe you can do it for people in Redwood City, the people in your neighborhood."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And the next time someone says, you know, sit like a mountain, you'll say yes."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "Anything? Is this a song? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "They had to make a hugely important decision for the life, like it was a major life decision."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "So I have some respect for the value of thinking and churning and just kind of being with it."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And the energies of the body can move."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And then what happened to me, the big decisions I had, I don't think they were really time sensitive."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "In a way you feel maybe stable or maybe maybe at peace or maybe just a feeling of like really here connected and alive and present like yes."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "And if it feels okay with you, it feels nice."}
{"prompt": "S.t.o.p. (see, Taste, Open, Peace)", "completion": "Maybe share with very simple, very simple, just a few words perhaps of what was satisfying for you and whatever hints you had of what it's like to be full."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "If only that can happen, then it, you know, and yes, that's going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "Maybe it's a gladness that comes from relief that I used to be so attached to things and wanting things and spinning out."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "And now we're sad and disappointed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "There's time and place for it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "And so this idea of refuge, the ocean of refuge, the ocean of stability that's underneath the surface waves that come and go, and sometimes there's a high wave, sometimes a low wave, and these are all just a surface manifestation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "But there is a deeper place of refuge, the foundation for it all."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "And you can learn to ride the waves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "And that refuge can give a lot more clarity and ease around how we navigate and experience the comings and goings of things like sadness and gladness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "And then sadness can be a whole range of things, depression, sorrow, sadness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "If you see how you are, then you're on the path."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (2 of 5) With Gladness and Sadness", "completion": "There's a time for it, go for a walk, sit and have tea, allow for it, and then underneath it all, refuge."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "Well, we think this is what's happened."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "So I think that that there's a different perspective that the practice and the teachings offer on what is true."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "Well, the truth of this moment is, here's what's arising from me right now."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "I've not tried it yet, but."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "And that's pretty deeply conditioned in us, you know, so red means stop, green means go."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "It's like, well, how can you think green means stop, you know, green obviously means go."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "But I think something that also is helpful to remember."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "I think that's and then they were saying that you keep saying these things and then you're saying I'm not sure and that is actually the truth because I was trying to we can't be sure of anything you know I mean like just basically on the views but then the opposite also there is like some truth in the opposite also yes you are holding that's exactly where I was kind of getting stuck it's like you know I was coming back to well you know who knows this is what it sounds like happened but I'm not sure I don't have the information to really confirm that."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "And that's a different, that's a different experience."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "Now if my view is wrong I want to have the right view."}
{"prompt": "The Truth of This Moment", "completion": "And there's so much suffering that happens by trying to hold on to it."}

{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So just normal stuff, nothing fancy, right? It's just an equivalent of what we can do with our awareness, with our minds, with our hearts."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So, you know, it's important for us to kind of come to know through our experience that when we work wisely with suffering, we can find ways to lessen if not get free from that suffering instead of making it worse."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So, and what helps us understand is this Sati, right? Building of mindfulness, yeah."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "It's more like playing an instrument, right? We're playing our heart strings, our mind strings, and we need to have a sense of attunement and warmth and connection to the effort that we're putting in."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And this warmth, you know, he says a passionate and strong enthusiasm or devotion, right? It's underneath because we realize the value and importance of something."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So then there's this idea of clear comprehension, right, which is actually there's four components."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "You know, trying to soften around all that and let things settle is sort of like, oh, here's this story."}

{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "It's also, you know, used as accepting."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "Acceptance is nothing more than non avoidance."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So we're, we're needing to kind of create a suitable way to relate to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And so we can use of the 10 perfections."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "But so now we're going to move into the F, the feel."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And then the ten perfections that support us are energy, right? We're going to need to sustain our energy and patience."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "You know, it's not, we just need to honor who we are and if we have a hard time recognizing what we're feeling in our bodies, it's good to just bring our awareness and hold the space where we can't feel it."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So using those characteristics really help."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And so it's, that's the process."}

{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "What I mean by this is sometimes we have a sense of what we might call the narrative self."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "And as we practice this simpler experience of the self, it begins to be more prominent and a lot of healing can happen here, as well as with the narrative self."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "And then it turns into this other arena for self-measurement."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "feeling connected to the bodily experience."}

{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "So we're using categories, but the purpose of the categories is to help us tune into what is already inside of us."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "And just to say that every single Dharma teacher, this is how they, this part of their training is to sit in and practice discussions."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "Again, this encouragement as Nikki talked about this independence in the Dharma of this sense of, okay, can I find my way with this? Can I hold it with kindness? Can I hold myself with kindness as best we can? It's not always available, but as best we can and allow things to unfold and use some of the wisdom we all have wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Metta for Oneself for the second day", "completion": "So encouragement to tap into that and to use that."}

{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "The doubt of this famous story of the Buddha, where a group of people, you know, who were sort of spiritual teachers coming through this town, and the townspeople are confused."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "They said, you know, two weeks ago, this teacher came through and she said that her doctrines were all true, and everybody else's were garbage, but then one week ago, this other teacher came through and he said that everything she said was wrong and celebrated his own doctrines and disparaged the views of all others, and, you know, one came two weeks ago, one came last week, and we're confused."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "On the other hand, when you know for yourselves that these and these things are skillful, blameless, even praised by the wise and lead to welfare and happiness when taken up and carried out, then you should enter and remain in them."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "It's not that it doesn't help, right? That it's useless, but belief itself doesn't free the heart."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And this practice is looking for something that transforms us sort of like in the bones."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Maybe now we're seeing that it's a neurobiological transformation, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "I was like, lucky, and that this was an easy childhood."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Between knowing one is suffering and starting to walk a path to freedom, there needs to be adequate confidence in the path and one's capacity to walk it."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And so we all have some confidence or faith that this kind of practice may offer some real benefit."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "I didn't get into the practice to address a particular form of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And maybe we call that faith."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Before I knew what the Dharma was or anything, there was some kind of intuition that I couldn't walk away from this."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "We can feel that how the mind can get very imaginative, can sort of construct lots of ideas to fill the unknown."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Does that make sense? And we sort of just keep doing it."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "But when that comes to some fruition, people, there's a lot of relief."}

{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "She goes on to say that this is what is known in Buddhism as bright faith."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "It's the continuity of intention that's more likely to catalyze change in behavior."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And the bright faith is like one of those mind moments where we're at the peak and it's like down with pizza."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Now, what did I fall in love with? What is the Dharma? What do I really know? What have I accepted? What do I simply believe? Because that's what I've been told or that's what I've been marinating in for all these years."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "How do we know what we know? And what are the standards of evidence that count for knowledge? And I'm not going to resolve that question tonight."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And so, you know, talk about doubt and faith."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "The, by far, the most difficult thing I've ever looked at, you know, in my short period here."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "It need not be humiliating."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "So I've been coming about the same amount of time six months and it's really been the mindfulness and the practice has really been helpful, you know, personally."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "My mind is serene and freed."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And so in the second part, there's also this sense of confidence, this sense of steadiness that comes from practice."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "Maybe something else, a way that we've been changed is gaining some clarity about our strengths and our capacities and maybe we've discovered that we can meditate when it's metaphorically raining or metaphorically sunny."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "But I also don't want to dismiss people who have discovered greater capacities, greater skills or greater strengths that they didn't know that they had."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "I talked about that in the guided meditation, so if you're tuning into any pleasant sensations, or maybe a better way to say it is to breathe in a way that's comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "Just opposite of equanimity, it's a little bit off-balance and it's a little bit squished, as opposed to being open and spacious."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "She says, so wonderful poet, and she publishes a poem every single day, and I just delight in her poetry."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And countless lists of things I thought I should do."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And countless lists of things I thought I should do."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "That is, when we let go, when we allow the warm-heartedness to ignite, our aversions, our cravings, when we allow the push and the pull to soften and just lessen, diminish the reactivity to our experiences, both external and internal experiences, when we allow those to soften and to die down, then our perceptions begin to change."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "If it's less compelling, it's easier to be equanimous, it's easier to not be so reactive."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And then to maybe notice how things become a little bit less compelling."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "Or soften any ideas like, pfft, I'm nowhere near that."}

{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "There's a whole range of giving."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And part of the delight was the way in which I became in a certain, I would say, hopefully healthy way, my needs became unimportant."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But the feeling that there's people they're caring, attending to them is formative."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "They feel belonging in this world that they're not going to feel if they feel repeatedly abandoned and no one was there to care for them."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And they would wake up in the morning and tell their family about their dreams they had."}

{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "We might not think very much of this, but I think in the ancient world there was a big change from where the central focus of some people's religious life was all these elaborate rituals of sacrifice for the gods."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "It's a gift which is somehow carry spirituality in it."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But it has a heightened value, the gift of dana."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "You can give the gift of fearlessness that people don't fear, have any reason to fear you."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "Can we just give without any concern for ourselves? Do we have any concern for ourselves? Can we benefit from the giving? Maybe a selfish."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But something different happens when we give in person."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "That's very different than just giving to the goodwill."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "So maybe it had some benefit."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And with that essay, they got into college and they came to you and said, later said, you know, by the way, you gave me the $10?

{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "So how do we decide where to give? How do we decide what gifts to give? Is part of the, I think, part of a considered life, a reflective life."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "This maybe benefits the person or brings joy or delight."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But the way that the Buddhism understands the ecology of the heart, of the mind, the monk was also benefiting from that."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And an exploration, a deeper exploration of the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "In the four foundations of mindfulness, these four areas the Buddha pointed to as places for us to cultivate this quality of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "Starting with the body, the first foundation, the first foundation is connected very strongly with the physicality of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "The fourth foundation kind of weaves everything together, looks at relationships between experiences."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "The struggle lies not in the sensation level of experience, but in our relationship to it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And so if we can begin to recognize the difference between the sensations and the relationship, we begin to understand how the mind attributes or contributes to our struggles."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "So for me, this has been a powerful kind of doorway exploring the body, particularly this elemental piece, the piece that I explored in the guided meditation, this elemental piece where we get familiar with the sensation level of experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And then the kind of broader sense of the body as we touch into the fuller sense of the body, not just the movement connected with the breath, but just kind of tune into the field of the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "We might feel the whole body as a field of vibration, pulsing, tingling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "That quality of vibration, pulsing, tingling is the quality of movement."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "It's the range, not just the hot side of it, but the range of sensations."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "So if you take your hands and then blow into your hands and then press your hands together."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And then we used the hardness or the earth element of the hands to press them together."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And so independence on the hardness and the movement, we could feel the stickiness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And she studied with Pao Auxayadaw who taught her this exploration around the elements."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "The elements practice is a very big piece of what Pao Auxayadaw teaches."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And she pointed to, he pointed to exploring in the mouth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "That can be pretty clear, the hardness, it's a pretty hard, it's a bone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "It's pretty hard, you can feel that bone there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "That movement of the pushing, that's air element, that's movement, pushing there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "You might notice slipperiness there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "We have sensation that is pleasant, unpleasant, again understood as being understood or constructed by the mind, but that there's a kind of a way that the body sensors are very attuned to that kind of pain, particularly to damage to the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And again, it may be more the idea of pain that we're relating to than the actual sensation level."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "I would say that it can be useful to check out how, whether the pain is more connected to the actual physical sensation, or whether it's more connected to the idea of this is going to get worse, this is going to, so is there, is there a kind of a way that we might be able to touch into the actual experience and notice the reactivity that's kind of in counterpoint to it? And maybe in noticing that reactivity, we might have the sense of reactivity gets stronger, the pain gets stronger, the reactivity gets weaker, it's actually not that bad."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "One of my teacher, Saito Utejnaya, speaks about inexploring pain."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "That idea that it'll be okay to move if it gets too bad, if it gets too overwhelming, that really helps the mind to take a step back and be able to explore it for a little bit longer."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And then see if you can explore this distinction between the physical experience and the mental reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And the exploration around the elemental aspect, what is the language of the body? That's kind of how I explored it for myself."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "Habitual kind of tendencies to relate to certain experiences in certain ways."}

{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Then it's natural to have expectations, wishes, hopes, fears."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "This is something that is very special or something that I've been looking forward to."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Natural enough, it's like writing a little list for Father Christmas."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "But if we're wise, then we set the intention at the beginning of a retreat to learn from whatever happens so that you make a clear and conscious intention whatever comes up, whether I have a toothache and I need to make an emergency trip to the dentist or whether my mind is clear and peaceful and all of my problems fall away, I set the intention to learn from that."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Dan Landry, maybe he's even here actually, because it was a walk through the outside air between the Hall of Residence where he was staying and the meditation hall."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "If we're wise then everything will teach us."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Oh, sorry, I must have taken a wrong turn there."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "We create suffering through our attitude and even when things are extremely difficult or painful, like our friend Dan being whisked off with a serious heart trouble during a retreat, then even then something you would never wish for and you decidedly like to avoid, even when the worst happens, the most difficult and testing, still it can be something that we learn from."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And so this isn't just a metta, a loving kindness towards external characteristics of the living situation, the people that we're with, or our circumstances on the external level, but it's also, and most importantly, relating to our mind-states, having loving kindness, having an attitude of acceptance for our own thoughts, our difficult memories, our uncomfortable feelings in the body or our reactions of jealousy or irritation or fear or anger that might arise within the mind."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "You shouldn't be there, you're not doing it right."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Like we have a painful memory or we have a jealous feeling or like, wow, his posture is much better than mine."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "You're not saying it's a good thing, but you're saying it's this."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "This is the way nature is shaped in this particular moment."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Well, if you call me wrong, that's fine, but, you know, from the rock side, it's just what it is."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "It's our mind that calls it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "If you want to go to Santa Cruz, you go south."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "So similarly, when we view a mind state, it's just like looking at the road."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "It's just if you take that term, if you go that way, then it'll be pleasant for yourself and pleasant for others."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And that very attitude of collaboration is something that's going to benefit us."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "But with patience and application and kindness, then slowly the child learns."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And what he would say is that how you are at that moment creating a false image."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "We're establishing our practice based on self-view."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And this is a simple principle, but it makes a big difference."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Ajahn Chah used to regularly refer to the monastery as a mental hospital."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "We create the conventions of our world."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Three years ago, this wasn't, it didn't exist."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "That's a convenient, a set of convenient fictions, I would say."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "I'm not saying that the entire world is a dream or is an illusion, but what we're all experiencing now, I mean, this room, this Dhamma talk is appearing in your consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "55, when's you going to finish feeling? That's what this is."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Okay, rather than doing something now to become enlightened in the future, can I be awake to this feeling now? Can I be awake to this feeling of imperfection or a problem or an incompleteness now? Can I be awake to that feeling now? What is that feeling? And seeing when that perspective is shifted, how that reconfigures our world and what effect that has upon the heart."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Here is the mind aware of a jealous feeling."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And then see if, in that moment, we can shift the perspective and see the difference."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "And you will find the request for the refuges and the eight precepts is, there we are, page 74 and 75."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "So we have a restful night and that we'll gather together in the morning at six o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Again the English version of that and that is to be found on page 15."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So today, the tool of exploring the refrain of the Satipatana, which in some way is, I don't want to say more important, as important, is very important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "After the teaching, especially on breathing, the refrain goes back to the body, says the body, it talks about the body, after postures, it doesn't say postures, it's the wording refers to the body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So as I read, in this way, in regard to the body, one abides contemplating the body, it doesn't say, you know, one abides."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "The reason, he says, the reason Western meditators tend to progress more slowly than their Eastern counterparts is the tendency to become absorbed in the content of awareness, rather than continuing to attend to its process, becoming preoccupied with individual thoughts, images, memories, sensations, etc."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So the external practice is so important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "And some commenters, commentaries say, since we can't do it at the same time, you go back and forth."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "I cannot emphasize how important these practices are, the refrain, the internal, external."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It's also said though that these four noble truths are what all of the Buddhas of all times come to realize when they become liberated."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So this too is really helpful for us to know because it's not that we've done something wrong and therefore we are afflicted by Dukka."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Simply by virtue of the fact that we're here as living beings in this round of samsara, that is this round of birth and death where we reside, there is Dukka."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because even though we do use it, it's a limiting translation."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And then for some of us, we've just used this Pali word of doka, which means the unsatisfactory nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I experienced a tremendous amount of the first kind of doka, body and mental anguish for three months."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Things are always kind of shimmering in movement arising and ceasing in this way."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Empty of any stability whatsoever."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So again on retreat where I had a very clear and direct understanding in a very worldly kind of way, you could say of this kind of doka, the constant arising and ceasing of experience, was related to my fingernails."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The very moment that those fingernails are cut, they're starting to grow right away."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That's what he says, he sums it all up, in short the five aggregates of clinging are docker too."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It's not a personal thing at all."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That's not what it's about either."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Usually we don't have the staying power to be with the painful or the difficult or the unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So it's very difficult for us to begin to turn to it and let it in, isn't it? It's painful."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And it can be quite difficult for this kind of mind to let go of the difficult, of the unpleasant, of the painful."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We come to see that this is what all living beings experience."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So with the support of the compassionate heart, the practice of wisdom and mindfulness, slowly we begin to open to this first noble truth."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Just as the Buddha said, we fulfill his instruction related to this first noble truth."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So if you know the experience of thirst, if you haven't had any water for a while, you know it kind of gnaws away at you."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "What usually happens though when there's suffering? What do we usually do? I know that I've done this."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Ah, there's wanting in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And we'll do sometimes whatever we can to fulfill these desires for the sense pleasures."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We'll hurt ourselves, we'll hurt others just to get what we want."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That's where the suffering lies, we cannot keep them for very long."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And the breath hasn't even arisen yet but we're projecting into the future."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Then the third kind is craving for non-existence."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The first one is leaning into the moment craving for future existence."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We're needing to go somewhere but somebody has stopped us on route to wherever we're going and they're engaging us in conversation and we want the conversation to end."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So you had that feeling where inside you're walking away backwards but actually you're standing there having the conversation but you're already in your car driving off somewhere."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We can see them showing themselves there."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So what was the Buddha's instruction related to this second noble truth? First noble truth, doka needs to be understood, second noble truth that craving, the cause of suffering needs to be abandoned."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So let me give you an example."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It was a kind of an intimate conversation and I really wanted her to understand what I was talking about."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so I spent quite a few months trying to get her to understand."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I wanted her to understand and I could see that I was suffering."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "What is instruction related to this third noble truth is that the end of suffering is to be realized."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But then there's also partial realization of the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because more often than not we hear about the four noble truths or the end of suffering and we're looking way over there for the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "For example when we let go of wanting the pain in the knee to go away."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And because we seek to gain control over the tides of pleasure and pain, which we can influence but not control, we essentially, to manage the permeability, the insecurity of being human, we turn to a mechanism."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "The consequence of any perception of threat is the activation of basic fight or flight reactions, motivating attempts to escape or avoid."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "Because I'm devoting large amounts of time and generating and attending to worrisome thoughts, much of my life is spent living in an illusion."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "That gesture of leaning forward is said not to be uprooted until one is very free."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And peace, even a little, even for a moment, can feel like such a homecoming."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "But that's a tall order just to let go of clinging, yeah? So there were just a few very concrete things that I wanted to say about supportive conditions for tranquility."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "So supporting tranquility."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And the Buddha phrased this by something like, does somebody out there know a way or two out of this suffering? And so we have this question about our lives."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "When we're in resistance to what's here, we're more combating in the way that we're used to with aversion and hatred and clinging as opposed to engaging through compassion, kindness, patience, love, wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "For others it may make more sense, you know, for me it was just so counterintuitive."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So in the Buddhist path, in this eightfold path, it's a path of engagement."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Because there's one famous teaching from the Dhammapada."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So this path analogy is really appropriate in a way."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "It's like the Buddha says, yeah, there's this path that you can follow."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "That's just like somebody saying, yeah, if you want to climb to the top of that mountain, you need to follow this path."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So this is this teaching helpful, unhelpful, what's helpful, what's unhelpful."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "What is helpful in terms of if we want to move in the direction of a peaceful heart, of a heart that is not constricted, not in contention, then these are things that will help and these are things that will get in the way."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "He just articulated something that was naturally happening in the world."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And so we can't fight these natural laws."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Or it just loses its luster."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So the quality of the mind when it's experiencing that, when we touch into that, we feel that experience of, ah, this feels painful."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So there's a reason why we say what we say, there's a reason why we do what we do."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "If we frequently ponder and frequently engage with greed, aversion and delusion, that becomes the inclination of the mind to engage with more greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And our system, again, this is kind of the way in which I think of it as a natural law, our system understands, especially when we see this with mindfulness, see that quality of love and generosity and wisdom when we see that kind of release."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "We're more likely to engage in the world with a kindness and a wisdom and a compassion."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And so he went and searched out these five companions that he had been practicing with."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And I'll follow up a little more about karma next time, a little more of the actual specific teaching on karma."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Those motivations have been conditioned over and over again."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So the mind in my case certainly, years of practicing anger."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And in that reading and engaging, it's like, okay, well, there's a different possibility."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And yet that little bit of information, that little bit of wisdom may give us the possibility of doing something different."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And that's the beginning of its transformation."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And that's the drug that keeps me going."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "There's a search box, you could maybe type in anger or working with anger, you'll get a bunch of talks there to listen to."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "I see you and I guess I just continue with my day as best I can."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And I also began seeing that over time, seeing more of those actually meant that I was seeing less of the really big ones."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And now it's time to stop, so thank you."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "I think the Buddha was really interested in helping us to understand what's going on in our minds that creates and makes us struggle with the world, with ourselves, with our relationships, with our cultures, with our work, with whatever we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "It makes us respond or it has us kind of believing certain things are true when they may or may not be."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "It's that, you know, we've been conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "We have been conditioned to engage in the world in certain ways."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "When things are pleasant, we tend to like them, want them, want to get more of them."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And if we are not mindful of what's happening and not aware that certain conditioned habits and patterns are actually creating a feeling of distress, of dissatisfaction, of pain, of confusion, if we're not aware that our habits and patterns are actually doing that creating, we think that it's something out there that's making those feelings happen."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And then further can lead into full-on greed or anger or fear or hatred."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And yet our mind in not seeing them has believed that they are helping us to navigate the situation so that we will get what we want."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "This anger is optional, it's extra, it's added."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And that's kind of more at the level of belief there."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "I need to get rid of things that are unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "Having that thing is what is going to make me happy, another belief."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "If it's simply liking and not liking, it can be interesting to notice that too."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so when we're kind of hooked into that whole belief structure, we are not really seeing the painfulness of the craving itself, but only seeing the possible relief that we'll get when we get that thing."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "There's a little bit of wisdom that I'm offering here about how this works, can help us to have some curiosity about these reactive patterns and witness them with mindfulness, begin to learn that craving already is suffering, that aversion already is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "The wanting is telling you that you have to have it."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "Essentially, you know, there is a little bit of happiness that does come when we get something pleasant that we like, that we want."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "What goes on in there? What are the beliefs that happen? What are the thoughts that happen? Seeing if there can be a kind of, when there can be a curiosity about our reactive emotions, it gives us a lot of room to let those patterns kind of play out without repression and without expression."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "They cannot fathom another way to act in the world."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "We can't fathom that anger, anything other than anger would help us to correct that situation."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "Because this is a huge area of what we add, and it is often invisible."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So there's what we could call our own personal views and beliefs that are based on our own personal conditioning, the own way that we've been shaped by our experience because of our own body and the way our minds work."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So, you know, different religions have different perspectives, different cultures have different perspectives."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "This is kind of views that we share as human beings in a way."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "This sense of self is a truth, an entity that I exist as a being."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "It is something that, and this is essentially some of the deepest level of seeing what's added, the levels of basically taking what's impermanent to be permanent, taking what's unreliable to be reliable."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And he says, you know, when you ask the mind a question, when you do that, is it just because the mind is naturally curious? And you know, we are naturally curious when we're born."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "I mean, this very same patterns of conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so that is where we really have what's added is in that tangle."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And yeah, things are not controllable."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "The self-hatred is an issue."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so, and our minds can't quite see, well, is there a way to untangle this? And that's actually a poem the Buddha offered."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And it's, there's not a hole in that cloth."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And our mind just begins to understand things from a completely different perspective."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so wherever there's suffering, there's this opportunity to have this knot turn into this weave."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "Those would like to stay and we'll do it on Zoom like we have in the past."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "And so if you'd like to be part of that, I'll post later today the link for the Zoom meeting and it'll be on the What's New section of IMC's website and also IMC's calendar and I'll also put it on the chat tomorrow as well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "That some of the greatest suffering that people experience is when they've been a real personal violation, whether it's a physical violation against your body or whether it's been a violation against some deep sense of trust or deep violation about who you are as a person or in a relationship to others."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "It's not this happiness that, oh, now I fixed the car, the tire, and that's great."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "And so when you become yourself fully in this personal way, then it said, then the dharma becomes itself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding Our Way (4 of 5) With Happiness and Suffering", "completion": "When you are yourself, the dharma is the dharma."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "What is obvious? What does awareness know? What is awareness receiving? Awareness receives our human experience, sounds, body sensations, thoughts, emotions, moods or mind states."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "These qualities of physical experience are more the elemental level, the specific quality of physical touch-sense experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "We know awareness is happening because it knows objects."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "Perhaps the simplest is just knowing that you're aware, even though you may not know how you know you're aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "This is the experience of knowing that you're aware."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "You don't have to look for it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "Taking that in, you don't have to figure out, identify or look for the qualities of that experience right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "You don't have to track my words, but perhaps you might notice that the words are coming in and being understood."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Aware of Awareness", "completion": "It can feel like awareness is taking in many objects or many experiences simultaneously."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "And there's no way you can tell these people, you know, the professors who write academic articles or give lectures, that people were leading a meditation retreat and then go someplace else at the end of the retreat, or the people who were talking on the web."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "Suppose you want to steal something from someone's house."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "What do you believe in? You believe in the fact that he was awakened and what are the implications of that? First general implication is he found awakening through his efforts by developing qualities that you too have in a potential form."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "All of that comes under kind of the content of conviction."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "But you have to provide yourself with alternative desires and alternative sources of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "When you really feel like you've got to have this pizza or nothing else, say when I have an alternative, I can just sit here and breathe comfortably, I don't need that."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "And pizzas are relatively innocent."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "And then reordering your desires."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "We'll talk to you a little bit in a few minutes about some of the deeper implications of that."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "Now, the difficult thing here is in the grammatical case of the in terms of, it can also mean by means of."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 3", "completion": "But the goal itself is not described in those terms."}

{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "I was walking out of my house and I was trying to figure out exactly what talk to give, and my wife had some really good suggestions."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "Boy, it's so strange doing this thing."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "Because that's what the Buddha said, right? He said desire is to be extinguished."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "This space, this gap seems like the problem."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So I want to kind of look at these."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "What's helpful? What's going to lead to happiness and peace? And what's going to lead to more suffering? All we can tell is usually the state that the desire puts us in, right? Because it's immediate."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's not going to, even if I find that thing, it's not going to be different after I find it, right? Because I'm still me and I still, the desire is the problem, right? Now, even with this preview of the coming attractions, we're still going to want it, you know what I mean? Like we want what we want."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "How could that be? How could that be that the very thing that I want is causing me to suffer? I mean, it's ironic to think that the things that we want are causing us suffering."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "The problem is that whatever we desire can't fix us because we ain't broken, right? If the imbalance is mistaken, that's like opening up your car hood and throwing in an extra part and hoping it runs better."}

{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "You hope for something to come from the stars."}

{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Both wanting not to be and wanting is both called desire."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "You know, it's sometimes it's really nice and sometimes it's not nice."}

{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "The particular form of desire which is called craving."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And I love that connection to the breath, because when the breath is fluid and relaxed, then the motivations that come out of us are very different than when we're tight and tense."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "There's a lot of things you can cling to."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So one fork is the fork of craving."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So the other road is aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And don't even listen to dharma talks and think you get it."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "If we want something, then how do we get it? And so there can be planning."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "How am I going to get this strategy? Crafting also is often connected to our sense of self, self-identity or ego."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And a lot of craving is egotistical."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Not because I like red or because I like sports car, I like to go fast, but because if I could pull up to the sidewalk here next to IMC, right in front of the red sports car, then I'd really show all of you my true nature."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Now in studying craving, when you look at craving, notice when craving, the kind of desire arises that's kind of clinging or tight or compulsive."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "I went that title, I went that book, that book, that book."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Sometimes I wonder about this internet or the shopping channel."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Let's say craving is often connected to discursive world, to compulsive world, and usually when we're craving, we're not settled on ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "It holds physical, energetic change that happens to me."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Unpleasant, or ugly, or something."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And the last thing about the fuel for craving, which is very interesting in Buddhist psychology, and Buddhist psychology teaches that one of the fuels and triggers for craving is craving."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And it has a number of functions, the noting."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "It's a noting might help you with that."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Another way to work with desire is to let it go."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "If we keep acting on craving and living with craving and engaging in it, it actually feeds it as a habit."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Why is ignoring? Another thing to do in our practice, in mindfulness practice, is to feel it really well."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Another is that these emotions and feelings and motivations that come with craving have their own process and own unfolding they need to do if we get out of the way."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Also, if we feel really well, you might find out that the craving is really the cover, the storefront for something else."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And so if you just kind of let go of the craving too easily, you might not ever actually have a chance to see the loneliness."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And some people have a whole firm of lawyers in their mind that are ready to argue the case of why it's reasonable and appropriate and necessary to have this addiction fulfilled at this very moment."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "You know, well, you know, the Buddha probably meant, when he said, you know, don't lie, you know."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "This big wave, you know, you feel like you're caught in the wave, it's really strong, and sooner or later, it'll pass, and you'll find yourself on the other side, and things will get calm again."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So all these things are forms of study, but to really study it, like you're going to do, if craving is a big issue for your life, pretend you're going to get a PhD in craving, and you're really going to get to know it well, you're going to explore it, and you're not going to get a good, you're not going to get past your dissertation unless you really have studied this phenomenon carefully."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "What's the, what's the, what's going on with craving that's separate from the words and the thoughts? What energetically in your body that's, you know, because you can, you know, all of you, maybe it's dangerous to suggest this, but all, I can suggest that you, all of you create a thought right now."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So the world of thoughts, for instance, but what are the beliefs around it? I need this."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And the other fork is a fork of aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So I'm sorry I didn't do the aspiration part, but maybe should we do it next week? And the problem is that the two kind of, the talk was a whole."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Maybe I have to do a little quick summary about craving."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And then we can launch into aspiration."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I just had a little bit of a reflection right at the beginning of the sitting around that placement of the Eightfold Path being at the end of the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The unreliability is unreliability but the suffering that we experience around it, that's caused by or it arises when we crave something."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And then the Fourth Noble Truth, the path, the Eightfold Path, the Noble Eightfold Path that is the set of practices, steps that will support us to move in the direction of letting go of that craving."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Some people talk about the truths kind of modeling a medical model, the First Noble Truth being what the illness is, the Second Noble Truth, the diagnosis, like what's causing the illness."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But we have to have some sense of confidence that there would be a direction, there is a possibility for this freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So this freedom, Nibbana in the Pali, sometimes translated as enlightenment, awakening, those words convey, I don't know, to me, hearing about these things, really before I began studying what the teachings of Buddhism offer and what the actual path of practice is, I thought that enlightenment was something that I was supposed to find, you know, kind of like some state of eternal bliss, or I don't know, something along those lines."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So those translations maybe lead our minds to think that it's the getting of something, the acquisition of something, the acquisition of enlightenment, the acquisition of bliss, something like that."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The Third Noble Truth, what goes in there."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And full disclosure, I'm going to edit them slightly for gender neutrality."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So the ending of greed, aversion, and delusion, and elsewhere it says, and somebody asking, asked, I think it was Shariputra, so is there a way to the ending of greed, aversion, and delusion? How do we do this? How do we, how do we let go of greed, aversion, and delusion? And Shariputra said, the Eightfold Path, that's how we do this."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "What are, how is it that the Eightfold Path supports the ending of greed, aversion, and delusion? How does, how does that, so this is kind of like looking at the mechanics of the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Another term, the exhaustion of craving."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Seeing a few times that different perspective begins to weaken that underlying tendency, but it is the complete kind of uprooting of that underlying tendency that this path is said to move us towards."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But it does it in this kind of a staged fashion."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "They are not, I could say, in our kind of language of, you know, how, how the brain works."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's, it's, it's not, you know, the kind of software that's easy to take out, you know, in, in the computer analogy."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's, it's kind of, you know, it's, it's, it's deeply embedded in the hardware, but it's not part of the hardware."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's not inherent in our mind."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So that's the second level of how these patterns of greed, aversion, and delusion play out in our lives."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Or if you're really hungry or tired, the mindfulness might be a little weaker and certain habits or patterns might resurface."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That's the purpose of this ethical section of the path."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "To cultivate, again, and the orientation towards this mental cultivation is around how does this support letting go of greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this kind of wisdom, the direct seeing of that with the effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration, that begins to develop the wisdom that it doesn't make sense to cling."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The work is so much more every day, moment to moment, just noticing what's here, not stepping into those actions that would create harm."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "If the book is easily visible."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But then we need to walk the HL path."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So it's a chicken and egg question, right? Well, I think that the, the, the, what I talked about last week, the little tastes."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So when like the, the, the full freedom is the uprooting of the latent tendency towards or the underlying tendency towards greater version of delusion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And so I think that the progression in the Satipattana Sutta, starting with body to help us become aware in the encouragement at the beginning."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "That's like the first instruction almost in the Satipattana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "We've got skin, we've got hair, we've got nails and teeth, and any one of those particularly beautiful if you think of it all by itself."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It is a transition point where we begin to, to touch into something that is actually happening in the mind, this, this, this experience of pleasant unpleasant neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So, just to describe a little bit about that piece right now."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So I think sometimes in hearing this, you know, well, gee, if I just know it's unpleasant, you know, why would I take care of myself if I didn't react to it? But there's there can be discernment around pleasant and unpleasant that comes with wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "What can happen is that there can be a discernment of this unpleasant experiences damaging to the body to the to the being."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And so the unpleasant sensation and the not liking that that unpleasantness of the not liking, they come together."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And then when we actually see, Well, what is that reactivity happening to."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "This person experiences a feeling caused by a single dart rather than the two darts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "That's what's going on with the reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's probably the easiest place to begin to see the feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's it's it's it's more obvious to us in a way that the physical sensation has an associated feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Also our mental experience emotions thoughts all have feeling tone also so you know emotion like joy for instance has a pleasant quality."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And what was interesting in that moment was that it wasn't so much that all of the reactivity was born what in that moment was born with compassion."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Because there was the understanding this was what was happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So that they did there was a study that really clearly demonstrates this."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And then there is the mind kind of based on the context the conditions the views the ideas a whole host of things interprets it as pleasant unpleasant or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "The scratching sound would come and there would be tension and there would be the unpleasant quality of the tension as well as the as the scratching sound so I was just noticing the feeling tone it was really quite an investigation of feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And the sound itself was not unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So it's really useful this is what I pointed to a little earlier it's really useful to recognize when there is some kind of reactivity because there's such a connection between the mind reacting to something, the experience of pleasant unpleasant or neutral and the mind reacting to it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And kind of, you know, there, there's a little bit of understanding, you know, okay, there's something happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "But what actually is that reactivity reacting to."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "That's actually what's pointed to as a in the Sati Patanasuta and this will get to in some subsequent weeks at points to beginning to notice the difference between what's called unworldly pleasant and unpleasant and neutral and unworldly pleasant unpleasant and neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So I've had a lot of time to experiment with the unpleasant sounds."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So often I can turn the, the thought, the reactive thought to it into a it's just the guys they're doing their job, you know, and so I really know that and so I hope we're going to look more at the feeling tone stuff regarding thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Yeah, yeah, it's actually becomes physically painful not just the idea of what it is is painful."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "So I'll talk a little bit about light, but first I want to quote the Buddha that's something that's very memorable."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And those three, and then the fourth one was the light of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "But as soon as someone turned on the light, there was this relaxation that happened."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And if, you know, that was the shoes you were given and you think that that's the way they're supposed to be."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And you find a pair of shoes that fit perfectly."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And I've certainly sat in meditation and not really known the cost of the strain that I was under because it was pretty mild and I get used to it, you know, to go through daily life."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "So I want to read somewhat famous parts of this passage of a conversation that supposedly happened at the time of the Buddha between a king and a queen."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "She then asked him the same question, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself? No, said the king, there's no one more dear to me than myself."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And then understanding the importance of this, the Buddha then said, and he said it in verse, if you surveyed the entire world, you would find no one more dear than yourself."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Is that selfishness? Is he reinforcing the selfishness of the king? Probably not."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "So there's something about if everyone holds himself dear, if everyone treasures themselves or loves themselves, you don't want to harm what people love."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "First is to discover the light, the inner light, the inner light of awareness that's free."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Though you wouldn't necessarily use that language, I'm not the light because that's just extra."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "One direction is inward and one is outward."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Each person is most dear to themselves."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "But do it with your freedom, not by giving away what's most precious inside."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And what we're doing is we're losing touch with this inner light, this inner freedom."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "I'm not saying it was easy, but that was the task."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "The most beautiful thing that I know in the universe, and I haven't been many places in the universe, but in the places that I've seen so far, the most beautiful thing that I know that exists is a liberated mind."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "It's worthwhile to be on the path to find that."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "We tend to not necessarily notice the feeling tone and we're already reacting to it."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "We're already wanting to push it away if it's unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "And so the that experience of noticing the reactivity first, that's pretty common."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "The first piece maybe before like trying to see the feeling tone first is to recognize okay well there's this unpleasant reaction that I'm having."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "And so then you might check in well what about is there anything that I'm seeing or is there anything I'm hearing? So, you know, kind of go through the senses."}

{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "Or a concentration practice, a really focus on making the mind one-pointed, which really helps develop a sense of well-being."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "You know, so one of the things I want to make sure as we talk about this letting go, a part of the cultivation is actually noticing when we're feeling at peace."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "What I'm wanting to do with you today is kind of try to get a clear idea of what vipassana meditation is about."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "That's the first of these inside meditation teachers who became widely known in the West."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And the labeling is applied when in sitting meditation, it's applied to the rise and fall of the abdomen as the main object of practice."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Yeah, very powerful this continuity of mindfulness that they emphasize."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Label really implies a word."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And it's just my experience."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And then finally, I think it's clear in the practice, again, from my own understanding, is that seeing the three properties of impermanence, suffering, and not self, are a very important part of that practice."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "That concentration is very important, but it follows in the wake of the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So I find that the best I can find as a match is following the Ramayana Purnika, who says that the contemplation of postures and the clear awareness of that is the best place to locate Mahasisaira."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Goenka gives some space to it, and Paoksaira gives quite a lot of space to it."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And so basically the talk I'm giving today is based on that kind of like, what is the common thing among these three? And I find the common thing to be, and now I come to the second of my topic, the so-called scheme of inside knowledge, the Vipassana Jnana."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So what Lady Sairdha did is he wanted to strengthen Buddhism in the country by encouraging lay to know and study the Abhidharma."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And he did that through this Abhidamata Sangha."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So I find that very interesting."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "These are the preconditions for this series of experiences to take place."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "You're probably all aware of that."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's not really that you work one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's more kind of there's a certain basic dynamics that this listing is trying to tell us, which in actual practice will never exactly happen in that way."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And once the experience of impermanence has become comprehensive in this way, there is another thing, you start a slight shift of perspective."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And the amount of fear that there is is a very good measurement for the amount of holding on that we have."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "There's three things I can see in everything."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's nice, but there's a problem with it."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And one suddenly realizes the danger of that situation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "They say that's when the compactness of the body dissolves and you experience the entire body in terms of changing kalapas, which I think is also fine."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "The basic point is that you see that things are disappearing, that they are dissolving."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Once you've seen it, you move ahead."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "In the usual context where this insight knowledge is developed, the power to lead you to a stream would be during formal meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I had a friend in Austria and he had never ever meditated."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And he didn't retreat, not in the Goenka tradition, but there's another branch student of Uwakin, the lady, I forget the name right now."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And he said, Anali, I never drank before in my life, but I went home and had a whole bottle of whiskey."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "The same holds also for getting into a jhana."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Could you say a little bit more about number eight, reflection? Could you say a little bit more about reflection? Reflection is very similar to number one."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Patisambhidamagam is actually a Abhidharma which was too late to be included in the Canonical Abhidharma collection."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "This is what I'm really wanting to talk about today, the three characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "There's an emotional process that has to take part, place, for vipassana to happen."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Thank you very much for your attention, time for question and answers."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I wish I could take out all those planets and lights that were even better, but then you wouldn't know what I'm showing, you know."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Okay, and how do you go about doing that in daily life? In daily life, I don't do vipassana meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And when I do vipassana meditation, I base myself on a practice of the goingka type, but the technical aspect pretty much falls to the background and I merely go for the characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And I don't even think about these, these are just basic feelings that pervade the experience."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Hi, I have a question about the three main, I have a question about the three modern day inside, the three teachers."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Why? I don't understand that."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I was just trying to understand what is the interpretation because actually when you go to the Satipatanastadiya Goenka, we are using your book."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I had heard some teachings where teachers say that the final entry point into Nibbana is occasioned by an insight into one of the three characteristics."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "But how do you experience it? As a nimitta, or a panihitta, or sunyatta."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's sort of the corrupting influence there that if you're attaching to a return then you would enter through impermanence because you would see that there is going to be."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "This is completely new to me, so I would have to reflect on that to see if that makes sense or not."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "This is how I was explained that this interpretation came about."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "But then, to my understanding, it doesn't work because the contemplation of the four elements, we get the simile of Bachar."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "The idea of the four elements is to separate ourselves into different parts, not to take out one of these elements and observe it."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I mean, I understand what you're saying."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's something that I've heard."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "That's Nyanna Purnika saying, because they do a lot of walking meditation, and this is what somebody here said before, that continuity of mindfulness, being aware of everything you do, and that fits very much with the basic idea of contemplation of postures."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "The other thing you said about using categories, and I just, we recently, in August, we had this mindfulness conference in Hamburg, and the whole topic was this Kabat-Zinn, and this mindfulness-based stress reduction, and the idea of mindfulness they have, and we had scientists from different areas, and also scholars, and we also tried to get Gil there, but he didn't want to come."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And we had a very nice discussion, and what came very clearly out is that the understanding of mindfulness as non-conceptual is not supported by the canon."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Mindfulness does not mean, oh, no concepts, no concepts."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I don't think that means that, you know, fire, fire, fire is what we're supposed to note when we have pain in our knee."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I think it's important to get it out."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And the kneading of the dow is the practice of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Yato yato samasati khandha nangudayabhayang labati peeti pamojang amma tang tang vijanatang As one sees with mindfulness the rise and fall of the aggregates, one gets peeti pamoja, happiness and bliss."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Patavi manyati, pata via manyati, pata meti manyati."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I've chosen to call this impermanent or dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So, thanks to all of you for the attention."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "May you be happy and healthy and may all of your progress on the path to liberation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "It's a simple description, an instruction."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "So there's a recognition of each of these properties as they appear within us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "And so it's so simple that it might be overlooked, it might not be understood how profound it is, that it's actually one of the central ways that Vipassana practice is practiced, is it really delving deep into the level of the sensations of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "The Buddha himself said that there is no awakening without mindfulness of the body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "What we're doing and partly just dropping into the sensations, just feeling the sensations that they appear, is that we're beginning to expand our awareness throughout our body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "The word pain is an abstraction."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "It's an umbrella term for sensations which are quite intense, and those sensations can be varied."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "It can get very claustrophobic, but if we can be centered and grounded and stable in our body, making room to feel the sensations, letting the sensations come and making room for them, then we have a much bigger capacity to deal with challenges, a much bigger ability to be uncomfortable so that we're not knocked over or pushed around or we become reactive or we get tense or we feel like our boundaries are being pushed because we have all this capacity to hold it and be aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "But if you turn the pyramid upside down, I mean right side up, and so it's sitting on its base, then you push it and it's not going to tip over so easily, or at all."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "So I offer you that one as an exercise to do supporting this sensation meditation is to draw up a list, a long list of all the words in your language that describe sensations, twisting, pulling, heat, hot, cold, heavy, light, you know, just go on and on, itching and whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And in Buddhism, anger always has hostility as part of it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "It can ruin lives, it can ruin relationships, it can ruin all kinds of things when it kind of festers or builds up or gets expressed in a variety of ways."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so to bring mindfulness into all aspects of our lives, it's necessary to bring it into the area of anger and to really take it on as a subject of mindfulness that's worthy of mindfulness and not only worthy in and of itself, but because it's connected to deep roots inside of us, it's worthy for really dropping into the depths of who we are and connecting to us and ourselves in a very important way."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So the question about what I want to try to do then is to talk about seven approaches, maybe steps about how to pull ourselves out of the mud of anger so that we're not possessed by it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Here it comes, that feeling in my stomach, that heat, I think it's coming."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So don't read a book about it so much as read the book inside of you."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And you kind of, you know, a lot of clarity."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And you can feel the pull of that memory."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so, to practice mindfulness of anger is a way of beginning to pull ourselves out of the mud."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But this is part of what mindfulness is."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And sometimes there's so much charge around the anger, the whole system is kind of like ready to burst or pop or there's so much churning, it's like a volcano in there sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "It's important to do the bathroom break or it's important to go walk around the block."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Can we just sit quietly for a couple of minutes? So we did."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "A powerful one for sometimes is just time."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So if you want to not be possessed by the madness and be able to pull out, then learning how to discharge is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And in that flowing of my thinking, I'm kind of letting my thoughts do what they do, I'm watching what's happening, I'm allowing myself to be angry, and I'm just being with experience, being with experience, being with experience until, in my case, I see one of two things."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And there's all kinds of things we can learn, but, you know, and study anger."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And I read it this morning as homework for my talk."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So to have empathic attention to the other and to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so they just suddenly blare out and are angry."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "It's hard to be a human being."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So to have empathy and care and compassion."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Psychologists sometimes reserve anxiety to fear that has an imaginary component."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Not that it has to do with imagining a future, predicting a future, thinking about a future in some way, and people have anxious."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But that didn't go over with my wife."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "What are we telling ourselves when we're angry? This can be somewhat subconscious, but if you have the idea, what is the story? And maybe even get a journal and start writing out the story."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You might start seeing that actually you have a belief system."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And hopefully, having done all the other processes first, the speaking can be wise and useful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But if you do, just warn the rest of us."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so I think there's kind of practice of mindfulness in what I'm teaching today."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So, you know, you want to be prepared."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So I'll take that as a compliment."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Because I went through yesterday all of the IMC's newsletters to see the history of what we did."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So to be able to look deeper down and study that, and so I think maybe also with a desire, I have to have what I want, get out of my way, or I'll just be angry in order to get it."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And wisdom dispels the delusion that underlies the ways that our minds participate in our suffering and our struggle with life."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "There's this kind of this deep belief that it is possible if we try to get what we want and we can finally get it in line with all of our ducks up in a row that we won't experience stress or dissatisfaction or unease anymore."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And that's what keeps us going round and round in this kind of endless cycle of what the Buddha called samsara, this endless searching, endlessly searching for the next thing for release from this cycle of craving and dissatisfaction and unease."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "But it's not through the paradigm of greed and aversion which is having things be how we think they should be or how we want them to be, but rather in the relationship to however it is."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "We practice so that the conditions are set in place so that more wholesome qualities of mind which give rise to ease and well-being are conditioned into and patterned into our hearts and minds."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And yet it's a natural process, and it's a conditioned process."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "We are to observe our experience in a non-reactive, not unidentified way, knowing experience simply as experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "By becoming aware that that is a created thought, one no longer believes such a statement or any thoughts about oneself being reality."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "This might sound like it borders on passivity, yet when there's room for our own experience to be okay, the qualities of mind that allows to blossom like compassion and kindness and clarity, discernment and wisdom, allows for a profoundly attuned and effective response to what is happening in our lives and in the world."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Because what you are experiencing now is just a result."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "When there's this absence of confusion and misperception, these are the qualities of heart that really naturally flow forth."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "The people are still coming in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So the way you become your own teacher is through trial and error."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's possible that a person sits at the end of the day and they're not very calm but it really helps to kind of empty themselves of all the stuff at work and to understand and see what's going on in some deeper level than they would otherwise about what's going on for them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So each person is going to be different."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Some people it's better in the evening, some people it's better in the morning and some people need to sleep, have trouble sleeping and they find out meditating in the evening, just their sleep is so much better even though their meditation is not so deep."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And I would meditate for about 45 minutes and the first 20 minutes I was always falling asleep."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And mindfulness is a very simple human capacity to pay attention, to be aware of what's happening, to notice what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Our wisdom might say no to some things, but the awareness stays open and receptive."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "That's something very sacred about that kind of receptive open awareness that can hold everything in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So any one more question? Anybody like to ask? Everyone's no questions from last week and from their meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Those of you who have meditated was all crystal clear."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's not complicated with judgments, with being for or against our experience."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It can happen in conversations with people."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So I'll tell you a story from, I was teaching a retreat many years ago, many, many years ago because, and I was a new teacher and in our tradition of teaching meditation retreats, we teach together with usually a cohort of teachers, like there are five of us teaching the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And these were mindfulness teachers."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "What's going on here? So I watched the football game with, you know, with the mute on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So, you know, so that was okay."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So we have a commentator in ourselves and that commentator, we're making commentary all the time, most of us, and that commentary has a big impact on us."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So we have commentators in our minds and we're commentating on our experience and people and what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "They don't seem to understand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Versus, was that the northbound or the southbound? And if I take the southbound, how far can I go? And so off you go, you know, you're on the train, you know, in your mind, you know, going down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And we wouldn't get involved in the commentary."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or if you did, we would see it as commentary and then come back and just be content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And sometimes when you drop into your body and start feeling it, then the commentary gets aroused in many different kinds of ways."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I remember when I was a young kid, I had kind of a high forehead and I was very concerned that I was going bald."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And I'm sure you were teenagers and probably didn't think much about your looks."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "There's no need to become disappointed if you don't understand how the mind wanders off."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "For a few moments, let your mind get quiet from thoughts and ideas, so you can just feel the sensations, the area where you do breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's like the domain or the place where mindfulness really unfolds."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You didn't know some of the sensations existed? Until, you know, you asked us to notice them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But initially it was kind of very relaxing, soothing and I felt very calm inside, much more calmer than only doing the breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But later on that strong sensation over dominated."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Great, that could happen sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So for example, when I brought my awareness to my right hand, I noticed it started to."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But if it's kind of foreign, we're not used to it, it can seem very neutral at first."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Was your posture beginning to slump? Not really."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But generally it's not good."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "If some body sensations, some part of your body, has stronger sensations than your breathing, some other parts of your body is more compelling, because calling on you, whether it's really pleasant sensation or unpleasant sensation, then the practice is to let go of focusing on the breathing and bring your attention into that place where the more compelling sensations are, just like you did for the hand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You just really feel what's going on there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "If you just stayed with your breath, with breathing, and stronger sensations happening, you probably set up a tension between this other thing wants your attention and you're trying to stay with the breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Just let go of the breathing and bring your attention and place it in that part of your body where this more compelling sensation is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So the idea is to kind of try to keep the commentary from getting entangled with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And many people find that when they drop the label pain, because it's such a bias word, like so frightening, pain, you know."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's not uncommon for people to find that it's not so bad."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I'm here to get away from it, to stop it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "In the mindfulness practice, within reason, you don't want to damage yourself, but you want to bring your attention to the strong sensations and explore how to be there with it in a relaxed way without commentary."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Just let it be there, let it come alive and show itself, let it be fluid and move."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I hope they give badges here at IMC for the best meditator, and I'll go to work and show my people how great I am, and it's like all this joy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "We get in, that's commentary, right? We're lost in this whole world."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Just feel it and let it be there and let that become fluid without a story."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Sometimes it's enough to acknowledge something, recognize it a little bit, and then it kind of stops being so compelling, and it's easy enough to go back to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And there's no time limit in how long you can meditate on some sensation in your body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or if I feel really hot, hot."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "What do you do when it's really hot? The right answer is when it's hot, be hot."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Because then you miss an opportunity to kind of practice mindfulness there, to explore that, to understand yourself, what goes on, what your reactions are."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And the official rest posture, if you're sitting this way, is just put your legs up like this and go like this, whatever you need to do, but this is one the next way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It looks like it's cut like diamond here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I wonder if I could get a real diamond glass."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Wow, you know, I'm always choosing the wrong line of profession."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So some people find it helpful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But some people find it helpful if they have a strong tendency to wonder off into this discursive thinking."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It keeps the mind kind of, they don't need to."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "The third is sloth and torpor."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If you're walking kind of casually, it might push you two or three feet down wind and you catch yourself and you're strong enough, easy enough, you can push yourself back into the middle of the road and then your casual wind catches you and you can kind of write yourself as you go along."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And same thing, if you walk too casually, it can push you a little bit, maybe not two or three feet, but it can push you maybe a foot and you can easily write yourself and go along."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And you can kind of walk that four inches if the wind is 20 miles an hour."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If you're too casual as you're walking, maybe 15 miles an hour is enough to push you off."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But if you're too casual, complacent, then even one mile is too much."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Get the idea? So the hindrances are like that."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But that raging rage is not going to, you're not going to manage that if you're on that sidewalk."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But slightly annoyed on the boulevard, that's no issue at all."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So depending on what you want to do, depending how easy it is to do it, the impact on these forces of your mind varies."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "I don't know what happens there, but I guess you don't wear high heel shoes."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And you find yourself kind of mind drifting off in those irritated thoughts."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So what I'm trying to say here is that in meditation practice, things which in normal life, maybe you can manage quite easily, for the purpose of meditation practice, become a bigger deal."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Usually with a sense of, a little bit of sense of hostility, but not always."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "There might be a lot of energy in the brain or the head spinning around or contraction and tightness there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Partly because the more subtle movements of aversion, ill-will, irritation that normally maybe you wouldn't even notice in your daily life are much more consequential and noticeable in meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And in daily life we don't notice so much."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "That person barely budged in that bow."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Concentrated meditation, silent for the whole week."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And so the partner dropped his hand down."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And then no one else in the room knew what, except those two and me, knew what had happened."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So the ill will back to ill will."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "We get preoccupied in something and you can't do meditation if you're preoccupied."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And this monk Nagasena, in an answer, this was recorded."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If I sit here and start thinking about those high-heeled shoes and the prom, what's more important? To spin out, obsessing about my aversion, about high-heeled shoes, and that person stepped on me? Or to sit here and be intent and present and clear here and now? If I have confidence that that's important, that the latter is important, then I'm less likely to go off in the high-heeled shoes direction."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And some people, confidence in the practice, now it's worse than that because some people, confidence goes into their aversion."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Not a few people I know and on retreat have discovered that their critical judgmental mind, where they're judging other people, and on retreat, in daily life you might not see how painful that is, but if you go on retreat, silent retreat and you have to live with yourself for hours in silence and you see the judgmental mind operating, you start seeing the cost of it, how painful it is."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "We really want something, and we're being, somehow it's not, we're not getting it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Another thing you might do, it has to do with more spiritual practice, is to cultivate good qualities within us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And I guess it's not the best analogy, but a really strong wind and having really heavy shoes."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Another thing to cultivate when there's ill-will is to cultivate and strengthen our capacity to be relaxed and calm."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And here is to learn to be present, to bring mindfulness to it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "I remember once, the magical moment on a retreat many years ago where I was doing walking meditation back and forth."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And it was in a hallway at the Angela Center."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And this person got into my lane."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So that's the mindfulness is kind of the core we do here."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Maybe even chant it out loud if you're alone or silent in your mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And that can remind you of the values of what you have confidence in, the values you want to live by."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So it's not just up to you to struggle with this, but you're actually supported by something much larger and bigger as well."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Don't go out of your way, please, to have ill will or anger or any of these good things."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "However, if it should happen during this week that you feel some anger, irritation, ill will, annoyance, and the whole gamut of these things, if it should happen, make it the week where you're going to study it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "So we come to the last talk on this five-part series on consciousness, and I've emphasized that I don't really know what consciousness is, but I have a premise and assumption that it's not a thing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "That hologram can be that clear and pristine."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And rather than debating with me or explaining it was different, my teacher just said, keep practicing, keep looking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And so I kept practicing with a lot of confidence and faith in this practice until the point came that I saw that consciousness also is in constant, can disappear, can vanish."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "He teaches recognition, clear knowing, clear recognition of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And kind of explore what is this, what would it be like to rest in awareness."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "It's often cited as the foundation of successful practice or a critical factor in spiritual growth."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Spiritual friends not only enhance our prospects for happiness right now in the immediate sense, but they also lead us closer to the goal of the Buddhist path to liberation."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "If we associate well, then we'll shape our minds to have more wholesome qualities and to practice the dhamma well."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "We are instructed to seek out wise friends and to deliberately associate with them."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So we may need to do some of this outer work in our lives in order to enable deeper practice."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So let's look at some of the suttas that talk about friendship."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Once I had a friend who was very kind to animals, that was kind of her gift in life."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "This is this quality of being able to take on the good qualities of others."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And I realized, I discerned that that was a good quality to be more aware of in myself."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And so because of being with her in that way and having that discernment, I began to see within myself more of an untapped potential for interconnection."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "We're told that we should consciously emulate their qualities and it's important not to fall into a comparing mindset where we say, oh, they have all these good things, then I don't have them, I'm inadequate in some way compared to this other person, I'd better hang around them and learn how to be a real person."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "It's more that by being with them we discover what's already in ourselves that we just weren't able to see before."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Why are we drawn to the presence of certain teachers? Why do people find monastics really wholesome to hang out with? Well, it's because they have strong qualities of good and our heart somehow resonates with that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "A friend endowed with seven qualities is worth associating with."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "She reveals her secrets to you."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And it says that they give what's hard to give and they do what's hard to do."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And friends and colleagues so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth by being a referee yet refuge when you are afraid by not abandoning you in misfortunes and by honoring all your descendants."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And note that it's not about and it doesn't say anything about getting something out of the relationship in a personal way."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "But even more importantly, it's about establishing healthy mind states and about doing meritorious actions."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Associate with such a sage, good will come of it, not bad if you associate with one such as this."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "I just can't understand how this could happen."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "It would be good for you if you would let go of your desire, your conceit, and your anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And I'll say that carefully."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Other things you can do with spiritual friends include volunteering together."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And then I think it's worth mentioning also that we can consider how to be a good friend to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So it's not always a choice that you would make, but a choice that you feel is spiritually required at the moment."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Because you comment on that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "He was going to have to go up into, I don't know, to bed or something."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And he needed to bring an attendant with him."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And you want to say something, but you just don't know."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "I just have trouble with that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "I'm not thinking of a specific example."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And, you know, maybe no action needs to be taken right away."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "I mean, that's all part of some of the—you're just accepting people the way they are and not being powerless over changing them and that's—and so I'm wondering, this seems to be so different to me."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So that sounds different to you than the taking on the qualities of those that we're associating with and having—is that what you're— I see."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Well, as always, there's a balance and I think you have to be pretty good friends with someone before it's appropriate to admonish them or, you know, in the way that I said."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And as we grow in strength and we become one of those folks that other folks are seeking, then there's almost a sense that it's a little bit—I don't want to say active like we're, you know, going out with an idea of what we're doing, but then, you know, we become that strength for others and others can come to benefit from our presence."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "We have good friends this year."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So, sometimes when we pay attention to our hearts and give them space some attention, then this unfinished business might arise."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Can I meet this moment with kindness? There's this poem that I, this poet, I should say that I, she's a Buddhist practitioner, and part of her practice, she's also a poet, is to write a poem every day."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "It's just not dwelling in aversion."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Nikki mentioned this, whatever a person frequently ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And I'll talk a little bit more about this later."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And then maybe there's some creative way in which can be a support for you and for the unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So these five hindrances, central desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and doubt."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So I just want to reiterate that when these arise, it's just something that we kind of include in our practice."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And there's so there's teachings around it, but there's this core fundamental truth that this is what it means to have a human life."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Maybe there's another something else that does resonate for you."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "But sometimes it's helpful just to call a spade a spade and to bring to mind also that other humans have this experience."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And so is there a way to bring some softness with the body this might mean going for a stroll and kind of letting go of meditation practice, but going for a stroll and just noticing what is pleasing, what is attractive to the eye or what is uplifting to the heart."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And there's so much pain that can be caught up in this structure."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "The different habits of showing up with some kindness and some spaciousness and some well-wishing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So there is one possibility of a way to explore this question."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "We can think about that kind of like the physical body of our own physical body."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "All of the pieces together kind of make the river what we understand conventionally to be river."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "Conventionally call the set of processes here, Andrea."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "But the name is not the person."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "Any more than the name of the river is the river."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So the Buddha talked about a number of processes that kind of make up our being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "The food that we ate, certain amounts of certain kinds of food would make us grow taller or be different weights."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So there's just a whole bunch of things that contribute to that process."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "We might take my body to be in me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "But they're just these kind of different ways that we attribute a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And this conditioning, this kind of tumbling on of these five processes, that conditioning is a kind of a lawful conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And so there is this kind of coherence, the aggregates, the body, this being here, there's a body and feeling and perception and mental formations and consciousness kind of associated with this being, it's kind of like a stream, again, a river, like we may have different rivers kind of coming together."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And for a period of time, the two rivers, they look very different, the soil they're traveling through is different."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And so there will no longer be that coherence anymore for this particular being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "That the sometimes what we what we think of as things being impermanent is that something was here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "It is continually that these processes of these aggregates are so continually changing that there's not a split second in which there's a stability in there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "Do a little mind exploration of how did it come into being? What created it? How did it get created? So even something like an object in the room, a chair."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "It was sitting in my parents' house for years."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "It's never the same, never the same thing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And so they're intimately interconnected."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "When there's a sense of self, there's going to be suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The word is connected with, in the Buddha's teaching, the second noble truth, which sometimes we say is the description of how or why we suffer, how or why we struggle, or why we get into difficulty, and that is because of the mind kind of craving or holding on or wanting to have things be a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And so the teaching around the second noble truth is that we should let go of that craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So this is a foundational or a fundamental kind of teaching."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But the Buddha said that kind of suffering, that kind of unpleasant experience, that's going to be there."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So the craving is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And what we need to do with suffering is to understand it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But understanding in this case being more of a visceral or kind of an experiential knowing."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "You know, when we feel those, often we aren't directly, or when those arise, we may not be directly feeling them."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Get familiar with what craving is."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "This is, the teachings, the texts talk about this in terms of a craving for pleasure in connection with our five physical sense basis."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The sky was this kind of orangey color, it was quite beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "You know, I know that walking out the door, I'm not going to be able to keep that orange sunset."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "It's like, it gets a hit of pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But it doesn't last for very long."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The next time you maybe want some kind of a treat of some kind, some kind of a cup of coffee or something, play with for a few minutes, just watching the wanting."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That mind of craving actually does not understand or only believes that the having of the thing is what's going to make me feel better."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The feeling of being caught by craving is a feeling of being like caught in a vice grip."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And as that craving lets go, we're released from that kind of, it's like we're being subjected to some kind of a slave master."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But this little kind of exploration can show us that actually one of the ways to end that dissatisfaction is for that craving to end."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The craving is the dissatisfaction."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And so the Buddha encouraged us to explore, sense pleasure, explore it from this perspective of, you know, how it plays with craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "This helps us to see, kind of to undermine the craving's perspective, that yes, that thing, having that thing will make me happy for a long time."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And so what happens next, as that sense of satisfaction fades, the sense of satisfaction of having something fades, is that we think, our mind goes, well, when was the last time I felt really good? Oh, it was when I got something I wanted."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So let's see, maybe there's something I can want to want."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Searching out things to get rid of."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Certain minds maybe have more of a proclivity towards the pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And so this is the orientation of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "It searches out something to not like."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And then there's the kind of mind that kind of is kind of more, well, in a kind of a more place of delusion, not really clear on what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And that may be the third type, the person who walks into a room and it's, what's happening? What do I do here? Shoes on, shoes off."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "What's the next thing I can get or get rid of? What's the next thing I can control or hold onto or fix or change? It's okay now, but it won't be in a minute, so let me find the next thing."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "You know, we have all these different roles that we have."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And this would come up at times."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But the other thing that I needed to really do was recognize and acknowledge when that identity of, I'm doing this really well."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "It's not like I don't have to be competent, but the sense of needing to have that be who I am, that is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That kind of needing to make sure that everything that I do is that way."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So the not liking it when we're sad is a kind of a not wanting that state."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So the looking at this begins to kind of unmask some of the beliefs and the delusions that are embedded in the craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But there's a couple different things to know."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "I should be able to let it go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "I should be able to not do that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Sometimes we can set it aside or we can recognize, oh, maybe I shouldn't follow through on that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That we see, wow, doing that is going to cause a big problem in my world."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So let me let go of acting on that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So there are times when we can see our mind headed in the direction of a doing, an activity, of wanting to get something or wanting to get rid of something, and consciously decide not going to do that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "This is a different kind of approach, being with the craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And this is a place where we can begin to get curious."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "I was that competent person, so I was going to do it right."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Like, no, I'm not going to look at people."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And I'm not going to look at people."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "I wasn't really noticing the wanting."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The mind is craving this contact to look at people."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And this is something that I appreciate so much about Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "We might feel like, okay, I don't know, maybe everybody else can do this, but I can't."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "When these arise, there's a way in which our attention shrinks."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "So if we have this thought pattern that just repeatedly comes up to help us look at it from a different way, from a different perspective, is maybe one way to think about it is to expand the field of attention."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But there's this wide range of states associated with metta, this whole range of colors and flavors."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And that's perfectly fine."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Sometimes metta can feel smooth and calm and soothing."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But it's turned specifically towards distress or difficulty."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "This might be markedly different than some of the ways we treat ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But there might be a way in which we say these things to ourselves, if not these exact things."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "So taking care of ourselves has this, but feeling a potential, a little bit feeling of spaciousness in the sense of possibility."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And we have to honor and respect that."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Sometimes receiving the love and the care is more difficult than giving."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And I appreciate Nikki's expression as purification cycles."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "So it's really helpful to stay with Mehta and really gain some familiarity with it, some comfort with it and kind of explore all these different colors and flavors of Mehta."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "In a different setting, which I'm usually teaching."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And so the stories of our lives turns out they're malleable."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And part of what I talked about earlier has been with difficulties when I had the example, like, well, maybe we have thoughts about something that happened to us earlier in our lives, maybe a divorce, pain, difficulties that arose from that and all these stories, right, all of us have a version of some stories of our life."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "The non-fixedness of things."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And that affects the well-being."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Oh, the well-being can be malleable, changeable, fixable, non-fixedness, I should say."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Which allows things to unfold differently, have different outcomes."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And of course outcomes are inherently uncertain."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "For example, we might have this habit of believing we are unlovable in some kind of way or rather this deep defect or something like this in some kind of way."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "So in this way we might see that our difficulties are maybe more constructed, more put together in a way, or a little bit more complicated than just the warm-heartedness."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "It's really, really important."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "With meditation practice we might start to understand with meta practice, and maybe meta for ourselves, or maybe the distinction starts to fade, meta for ourselves, for others."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "It doesn't mean we don't have access, it doesn't mean that sometimes we don't have access."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And now we can look at things from a different way, from a perspective, and maybe difficulties can be less difficult."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And there's a kind of instant karma to doing harm."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So a few things, not an obligation, not condoning harm, not denial or suppression, not boundaryless kind of, and not necessarily reconciliation."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "I think it was Stephen Levine said, forgiving people means you let them back into your heart even though you may never let them back into your home."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So it's not like we, it's not forgive and forget exactly, right? It's being clear."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Because we're, we're opening our heart to somebody that does not mean that we're condoning harm or not stepping in to prevent future harm."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And then he continues to say, the Buddha admitted that not all disputes can be reconciled."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So to make this concrete, I was thinking about an experience with an evangelical person who was outside of a 7-Eleven doing a kind of conversion pitch to me."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And the abstraction of fundamentalism or evangelism melted into this very real person, and it was so obviously a cause for my care and kindness."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Some of which are very conscious to ourselves and some of which really are not."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And if we're always trying to shore up that sense of self, keep out some visitors, welcome in the praise or whatever, it's a precarious life."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "It's just the other side of the coin."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So what does this mean? Anger arises towards others in an interpersonal context."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "But you know that impulse, when we get angry at somebody, we just want that anger to stick to the deepest essence of their being."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "It's just a really intense being human."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And nobody told us that when we were kids, you know, that this is like a big deal and it's intense."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And so there is an impetus there to forgive to save myself from that."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "It's not obligation, but I don't know just what it is."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And it's a way, sort of returns to what we talked about at the beginning, which is that our own happiness is inextricably bound with the happiness of others."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "But yeah, important for us to consider the ways in which anger does leave a lot of loose ends in life."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "This is a place where a distinction between guilt and remorse is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "I'm like this, I did this, you know, and we actually weave it into a whole sense of who we are."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Hi, I had a quick question about being angry about, say, persistent injustices that you see or witness in the world like also like the inability to have solutions for them that can work to stop suffering of people and like a feeling of frustration and powerlessness that comes from that."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "I don't think so, but sometimes I wonder in terms of anger and its constructive uses, I think I mentioned maybe in the first class that this is a place where anger may be important specifically and exactly the condition you mentioned and I don't think that anger is a durable, sustainable fuel for our engagement with the world and that love, we could say, is a more, it regenerates more and doesn't leave us burned out in the same way."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "That's sweet to be a part of."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And that is the principle, keep it simple, or say it a little bit more precisely."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And so you sit down to meditate, that rehearsing momentum is still there."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "A way of making it simple, maybe, is say, I don't know about this vent in a few days, but I can keep it simple by just recognizing that in the present moment, the mind is thinking about the future."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "That's more simple perhaps than being involved or reacting to or thinking it's wrong to be doing what you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "Maybe it's not very complicated compared to doing your taxes, but it's still more complicated than it needs to be."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "But I just kind of, okay, it's enough to recognize that that's how it is."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And this pattern of getting calm and then activated, calm and activated, might happen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And so then you find yourself, now you're activated again."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "What's a simpler way of being with us now? Where is simplicity found now? So this is going to have simplicity as a guide, simplicity as a reference point."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Insomnia, Pain, and Metta", "completion": "Do we self-flagellate? Do we apply what's called second arrows in the Buddhist teachings? The first arrow is the pain, the first arrow is the suffering, the insomnia that has arisen because of all the causes and conditions."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Sometimes it's also called lethargy or dullness."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So you're interested in having some warmth."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Or you could go out and light a match to the forest next to your house."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "I think most of us would recognize a better option would be to go into the house and turn on the heater."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "We go out and set fires to the world so that somehow it'll warm us up."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "The fear of failure can cause a lot of doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "We're not going fast enough."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And after five or six feet, it starts having doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And that's going to be as rocky as any committed relationship."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And, oh, what have I gotten myself involved in now? Gail used the S word one more time."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So some doubts are healthy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So if the doubt is in the practice, in the teachings, teachings of the Buddha, for example, that creates the context for Buddhist meditation practice, then you can always keep in mind the idea that the Buddha's teachings were always rational."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "But they don't understand, my life is really complex."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "A classic avenue for doubt is doubt in the teacher."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "It seems impossible for me to engage in this."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "I don't know if I could really develop my mind well enough to stay focused on more than 10 breaths in a row."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Because the believing the doubt that is often at much of the problems with limitation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And so one way to overcome doubt is to pour yourself in and really be here in the present moment in a full way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And so that's the disappointment is underlying that."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So to investigate, look more carefully what's happening."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Like imagine that your mind is like the sky, like a vast sky."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And some people find if they kind of open the awareness up like that then the doubt doesn't stick anywhere."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Don't engage it, don't be for it or against it, but just keep opening the awareness up as big as it can be and just let it kind of float there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Is it energized doubt? Is it draining doubt? Are we feeling drained by it? Are we feeling agitated by it? Are we feeling frustration? Are we feeling fear? Are we feeling resistance? Are we feeling disheartened? Are we feeling kind of just kind of bouncing around, going back and forth between different options? Is the thinking mind kind of hyped up, feel the hyped feeling? And so it's really a tricky thing to do, or it's an art or it's kind of a craft to learn to temporarily not focus on the problem that the doubt is concerned with but rather to feel what it's like to be a person who has that problem."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And one of the great things that I've discovered in this practice is how much things, feelings, emotions, attitudes and tensions, body sensations, tensions, all kinds of things that if I can be really present for it and just allow it to be there, that it has a kind of almost like an innate kind of movement to release, to freedom, to let it go."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And in that warmth, we find all these things that we sometimes are hoping to get from the external world, have the external world bring to us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Many things that people are hoping to get from the things in the world we can find from within."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And it's good to see it in small steps."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Some are much more the aversion type."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And some people, it's doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And when we've done something like this before, people find it eye-opening."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Since I think my impression is that most people, most of the time, have something to be angry about."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I went down there once, and I announced at the beginning of the talk that I was going to give a talk about enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know, that's what it was important to talk about, not enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So especially one of the longest discussions about anger in ancient texts is the longest discussion about loving-kindness practice, where it really lays out how to do loving-kindness practice."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "If you want to develop kindness, you need to understand the barrier."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So even a wholesome anger, if there is such a thing, could take the form of being caught by that wholesomeness."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So it's really something out of the wrong in the world."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "We have all kinds of things, the appearance of anger in our life, we have a relationship to that."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And then if you reflect on your motivation, your relationship to anger, are there wise ways of relating to anger? And are there wise ways, not the usual way of relating to anger, but ways you'd like to relate to anger? Because if you're motivated not to be angry, or motivated not to express anger in hostile ways, or if you're motivated to learn from your anger, or if you're motivated to find a way not to be caught by your anger, those are really healthy motivations to have."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Even though you might have a little whisper in the back of the mind that this is not good or not right or something, but the inner stories, the way we talk to ourselves, the feelings, the emotion, the energy, it's just kind of like carrying us along and we lose sight of anything else."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So when you have access to wisdom, work on your motivation."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Some people who are motivated to work on their anger are only motivated when they're angry and in pain."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know how to bring a kind of attention to the experience where in the attention itself, you're not caught by the experience, or you're a little bit separated or removed from the experience."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Something's wrong, I'm to blame, of course."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Or maybe even have a partner or friend who can say, look, now's the time."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And it was the guy next to me in the hall."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And seniority is really important."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Now there are many ways of doing that."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Some people like to go for a run."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And, you know, for times I've gotten angry, one of my common ways is to go for a walk."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But I just kind of let my thoughts be what they would do."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And I tried to understand what was the nature of the phenomena."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Because generally anger is not a single thing."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "There's so many different kinds."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know, it's just not an issue."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "We don't realize we're carrying an expectation."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I know that certain desires are just unrealistic."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I think it's really hard to be a human being."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And we have sometimes in our society a certain level of ideal of perfectionism."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So, the diffusing, de-stressing aspect is very important."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So, we have compassion for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And they talked about a movie they showed bus drivers in New York City."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so, one bus driver said that when, you know, before the movie, whenever someone rang the stop button five times, you know, his response was to take them five extra stops."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And he can't afford to take time to be with her properly and no one else is there to take care of her properly and it's just a horrible situation."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Empathy, Norman had ability to see what was going on to feel some compassion and concern for it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "What else is going on here? But sometimes substitution is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know, whole new information and just anger is diffused."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So story supplementation or story substitution is a very valuable skill."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "The kind of suffering that anger is."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I'm kind of misunderstood something."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "It's not like your boss, right? But he was being inappropriate."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I basically said, when you said that, this was my response."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But my hope is in talking about it, that you become interested and motivated to investigate your particular universe and how it manifestly works in your life."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And she got pregnant, and the parents asked, you know, you have to tell us who the father is, and she insisted."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So, is that so? I think the American word for equanimity is okay."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But is that so? You know, all kinds of things happen."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And we see a very different world, depending on which eyes we have, what lens we have, the place that we see from."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And it can feel like you're hijacked, you know, please."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And it's possible to have enough mindfulness and stability to have all kinds of things occur and not be reactive to it, not be agitated by it or caught by it, pushed around by it."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You know, there's a lot of people, you know, there's a lot of energy around praise and blame."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "It doesn't grab you so much."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "It's one of those, there's a kind of, we kind of playfully tease each other at home around my issue around this food."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Oh, is that so? You know, it wasn't exactly pleasant, but oh, is that so? Okay, well, that's the deal."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And for dessert, they served some kind of chocolate pudding."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So I know that's bad news."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "One of the gifts that my father gave me when I was about 13, I think, was he had one of these father, son conversations."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And he said, Gil, as you go about your life from time to time, you're going to have bizarre thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And so we live in a world where thoughts, we kind of saturate or paint the world with all kinds of thoughts and ideas and assumptions and what goes on, bias that goes on."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And I go, oh, how could they do that? I'm frustrated."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Maybe the person was thoughtless or I know something."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "We'll have a conversation about it."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But I don't have to now spend all this time thinking about it and guessing, wondering what happened and being upset."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And emotions can be sublime in some of the very rewarding aspects of the human life, and a very important part of it."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You're actually in some ways making yourself more full or complete as a human being because you have a wider sphere of."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And for all costs you should, or for all pills, you should, you know, figure out how not to be depressed."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You know, people will have judgments about me."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And I've told people sometimes, you know, that just let them know so that they give me a little bit of space."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So it's kind of like having an overview of something."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "I certainly have the capacity of what's called the delusion of permanence, is to feel something and somehow there's, I don't know what gene there is inside."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You know, I know that it's not going to be forever."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So I'll offer you one practice today if you're interested in finding some equanimity at a challenging time."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But if you happen to have that much time, you can try."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Is there anything you can offer us in response to this silly little anecdote? I think the first thing I would like to offer you is my appreciation of you for having such a strong, firm idea."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "My equanimity is really important."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And initially, it might be a little bit harsh or strong or maybe even rigid."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You don't have to be too concerned that you're doing it a little bit off."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And, you know, what we have to take into account to be able to make it, you know, figure out how to act."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So anyway, that's only one percent of the possible answer to your question."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Well, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And may equanimity bring you much joy."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "But when we actually start to look at what we think of as self, it starts to fall apart."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "Up at Spirit Rock, they have these turkeys."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "What is that? What's that experience? We have a lot of different identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And we can see one thing that that is kind of useful to recognize at times is that some of those strategies, you know, not all of them."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "I could, I could tell that there wasn't a complete like letting go of identity, but it wasn't very strong."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "You know, that's not, that may not be the time to try to understand it or observe it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And like for this afternoon, it was obvious that the pain in my back and the resistance to that that was more obvious than, okay, what's the sense of self that is being created that is resisting this, just the resistance was more obvious."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "I know what's good, you know, so really a strong sense of self looped into and feeling into that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And I think I'll go into this a little bit more maybe next time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And that's a kind of an indirect pointer to there is a kind of a clinging to a particular identity."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "Identities, we can talk about identities as ways that we're selfing and the idea of selfing as being a misunderstanding can create the sense or the idea that having a sense of self is bad or I shouldn't have a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And that moment the mind saw, this doesn't have to be this way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "It didn't actually make it go away forever."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And there's a kind of a kind of an opening of the container that the heart can rest in that place where it is not angry or confused or hating or trying to hold on to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "That kind of ease and peace is not necessarily one of nonaction."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And then some particular perspectives on observing that."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the, the impermanent nature of experience, noticing the arising in the passing of experience that also supports, we can kind of attune to that."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So we can be curious about noticing experience as arising in passing."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So we begin to see with the more continuous mindfulness how reactivity generates suffering right here and right now."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And so the continuity of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "There is the possibility of seeing the conditionality as we go in as we come out of the state."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And the commentaries actually point to that you know that going in and coming out of the focused concentration as being moment to moment concentration."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "You know that the kind of that intention to create that momentum of continuity of mindfulness seems to create these moments like when mindfulness arises for instance a little what I call a burst of continuity for just like three or four seconds."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And in my own experience I have witnessed in that realizing of mindfulness for those few seconds a very deep penetrating seeing into something about how suffering is created and the mind releasing it."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So I just wanted to put that in there that to kind of reframe what you're thinking about potentially by the word continuity of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "These are feelings arising."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "The scene is only the scene."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "Perceiving recognizing what is seen it comes with thoughts about what is seen."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So the seeing is the seeing and all of those perceptions and thoughts and ideas those are things arising in the mind those are cognizing arising in the cognized is only the cognized."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And then this teaching then encourages me to notice those as those two are just horizons."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "Just train to see explore this experience in this simple way."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "But like in the vipassana practice, you also want to be able to stay alert, right? So if you're too cozy, you might go into dozing, so kind of find that balance there."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "And don't worry about whether or not it feels like you've forgiven completely in saying this."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "If I have done anything to harm anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I ask for forgiveness."}

{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "May you care for yourself with ease."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So you can just continue this well-wishing for this person."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "You can connect with the physical sense of yourself sitting here."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "If you find it difficult to send metta to yourself in your current form, you can actually hold a picture of yourself at a different time in your life."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "May I take care of myself with ease."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So you can continue this well-wishing for yourself."}

{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And the one sitting in the chair who doesn't smell it."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But the taste and also we have tactile senses we do."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "It finds out what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So in our minds, we think."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So as we begin this exploration of thinking, I think we want to look at the different kinds of thinking that we do."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But some people haven't really recognized that this is what they do."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And that's when we think and we have conversations."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And it's amazing sometimes how repetitive discursive thinking can be."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so it's nice, anticipatory delight in thinking is nice."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "I'm thinking about, you know, something else."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And the amount of difference and change is very small initially."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "If the discursive thoughts are really strong, then the recommendation is you actually distract yourself, which is what people do."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "You see that maybe the jaws are kind of grinding."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Relax the tension associated with thinking."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "If I just think enough, there's got to be a solution there."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "The whole kind of phenomenon of I comes into play."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But maybe you need to say it again."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "You're not wedded to it or caught in it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "Accepting what is offered is accepting that what is happening is what is happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "And of course the mind will wander."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "It doesn't actually support our minds to stay here, to be here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "So even that wandering mind, when it's noticed, that too is allowed and accepted."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "So, arriving in your body, just opening to however you are in this moment, just taking that in however you are right now."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "Seeing if there can be a softening of the muscles around the rib cage."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "You might even, might even be possible to relax inside the hip socket."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "Let the awareness rest there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The group preceded me, started about 1986 or so."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we'll see how it goes this time around."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And now, you know, it's just everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So mindfulness is very simply the ability to see clearly."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And I'll talk more about that in the last class, the insight part."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so it becomes a strength that we bring with us, the strength of being present in our lives, the strength of being clearly aware as we go through our lives, and the strength of being able to see what's actually happening on deeper levels than we can if we're on the surface of our life or not really paying attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "One of the reasons why many people in the modern world like mindfulness is the way it helps to destress us."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So what we'll do here for these five weeks is I'll give you instructions for mindfulness meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So each week will be a foundation for the next week, and it'll grow like that as we go along."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Turns out it's easier to be mindful of emotions if you know how to be mindful of the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But that's to be expected, and it's not a problem that it happens."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So you might carry with you, oh, I did really badly before, or I did great five minutes ago, and I'm going to do that again, or that was terrible, and I should never meditate again."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so the basic elements of meditation, and then we'll do a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So you get a hang and feel of it, or how to do it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Because as I say in AA, bring your body and the mind will follow."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So your body is a real support."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The more elevated your body is, the easier it is to get your knees down."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so you have to kind of experiment with getting the right height."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And the usual way we have is to sit on these round cushions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Either way, whether you're sitting on the floor or sitting in a chair, an interesting thing to do is to take your hands on either side of your hips and push yourself off the chair, off the floor or the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And then some people will have a lot of tension in their shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Is to take one shoulder up to your ear."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And any of these things that helps you kind of be more open and upright supports being attentive, being alert."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Then you want to have your head squarely on your shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The instructions then are to keep your eyes kind of half open, looking down at about 45 degrees, with the kind of focus you'd use to look at a mountain far in the distance."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "If some of you sitting in chairs want to try sitting on the floor, get a cushion and then I will do our first meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Now, to help with this, it's really good to settle down, to develop some calm and stability in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And this continual doing it again is kind of the art of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And as you exhale, feel the torso, the rib cage relax and release and settle in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "As you exhale, relaxing the shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The belly drops down towards the pelvic cavity."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Parts of your body are engaged with breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Or it could be that you're aware of the full breath body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And feeling the physical texture or sensations as you exhale."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And then to help you stay with your breathing, you can very quietly in your mind have the thought in as you breathe in, out as you breathe out."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "See if you can be gently but committedly with every breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So mindfulness meditation, the way that we teach it here at IMC, begins with breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And sometimes we talk about the breathing being an anchor."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we don't want to get lost out at sea or crash against the shore."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Every time you come back to your breathing, you are letting go of some of the momentum of distracted thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So the breath meditation is where we begin."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Can you eventually become so practiced in the breathing meditation and the sense of presence of now that in the midst of a very stressful day you can immediately call upon it to center yourself immediately."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "I had just two quick questions."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so I feel like that's not, I'm actually going for a deeper breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "It's just as good as a deep breath for the purposes of developing mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Oh, look, mom, no breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But one exhale is made up of many sensations."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so you might want to get a little more interested in what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And the other thing is what I suggested is, say in your mind, in, out, as you're breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Does that make sense? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so that's part of the territory."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Remember, there's no mistakes here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Some people can straight out of bed."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "You can just kind of turn everything else off and just kind of practice."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So try to do it some corner of your bedroom or the house that you don't associate with a lot of other things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "They can think it's very important to meditate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "A number of places, including on our website, there's meditation timers that you can get."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And you can put these meditation timers on your app and then they have a very nice bell, you know, that you listen to rather than the smartphone kind of generic thing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So the idea in-out is not the mantra."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And I ask you also, please don't park in any of the parking lots around here except for ours."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So anything, any last words? Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And Tom is sitting back there, this clipboard."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "How many were here last week? Okay."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So finding a posture that feels sustainable."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So, coming into some subtleness in the body, finding some balance of relaxation and alertness, relaxing whatever can be relaxed, maybe the area around the eyes or the jaw, shoulders, belly."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "We might say that meditation is the practice of deeply honoring what it's like to be human."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "So, just imagining how you might feel that, that may cue you into these kinds of centers of emotional sensation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Now we can let go of that and bring some attention to the head, often between the ears or towards the back of the head."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And this is tricky because thoughts have a kind of gravitational pull to them."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So it's one of the main suttas that a lot of the meditation practices that have come down to us at this day and age of practice has come from."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So I'd like to start with the introduction to that sutta, which I find very inspiring."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So here's what you get from this."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Surmounting sorrow and lamentation, that sounds good."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So practicing with the body, physical body, practicing with mental states, practicing with unpleasant, unpleasant neutral vedana, and then with different aspects of the teachings themselves and reflecting on them."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So the elements are earth, air, fire, and water, right? So that was kind of their ancient categorization."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So, you know, the Buddha was a guy who lived 2,600 years ago, and he had sort of existential crisis and wanted to find out, well, what's the point of all this? What's the cause of suffering? What's the end of suffering? What's it all about? He went and did various spiritual practices, looked here, looked there."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Or no longer have a glass of water, there will be a mess, right? So it's not because there's some problem that I need to take personally."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So this is actually the law of karma, right? So when you do things with wholesome intention in the mind, then we'll have some positive effect."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And then there's actually a direct experience through our sense of the sensations of the body, right? So with the four elements of the body, it's helpful to pay attention to that aspect of things, right? So I'll just direct you a little bit to reflections about this."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "That's this continuous chain."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So we're constantly in this interaction with the air element, right? And in fact, it's actually one thing that we all share in this room."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So that sense of temperature, of heat, cold, right? And then sometimes kind of like you feel in externally, there's sort of an area in which there's sun and there's shade and different areas of temperature."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Hopefully this would not cause too much suffering from people who had wished they had eaten before, but didn't get to, right? So you think about what's in there, right? So think about where those elements came from."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So just noticing like where there's heat, right? Where there's coolness, right? You can pay attention to the air element."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So feeling that coming in and out, your breath, right? Wherever else you're feeling the air element, you can pay attention to the element of water, liquidity."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Yeah, so that's where it lies."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I was wondering because I mean sometimes when I'm sitting I notice like a sort of like adult ache or something in my shoulder just, you know, from working with the computer all the time."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So just like you're saying like is there feeling what it is actually? And then if you're feeling like heat, if you're feeling like solidity, if you're feeling like whatever it is, it's a way to kind of help get close to that."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So you notice that you feel like, oh, my posture is not good."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So, you know, spend a lot of time in sitting in chairs like this."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Maybe, like, it's stressful at the job."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So then it's, like, starting to get more and more crunched up, you know, like this."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "How is that, you know, like, right? So, you know, trying to let go of that stuff if that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "The Sutta itself actually draws this metaphor that's a little bit gory, perhaps, about being able to see the different elements as if a cow was chopped up at a crossroads."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So just a little bit of specifics."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Like the whole planet is like breathing all the time in this way, right? Everything's in motion, you know, and we're a part of that."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So how many people here have a daily practice that they feel happy about? Okay, so first thing is to say that you're not alone, right? So many people have some struggle with this at some times in their life, and sometimes other people don't, right? I found that oftentimes people take to or not take to, kind of similarly to their persona, so to speak, to meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Also it's helpful, right? So think about it like those of you who are having a hard time with practice."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I'm not having any special experiences."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So actually bring attention to it and know it, right? So these five hindrances are actually just like these weather patterns that go through your mind, body, and which actually you can bring mindfulness to."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "You can stand up actually to standing meditation."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "This is what it's like to hate where I am, right? How does that feel, right? And just feeling that, like really feeling what that feels like in terms of the body, the mind, right? So sometimes it's only when you actually feel that pain of that that you start to realize like, oh, there's actually not a great thing to cultivate this sense of hatred, right? You know, because otherwise there's a part of you that's like, oh, this is actually true."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I have this idea in my mind come up, clinging to it, right? Clinging to what it could be, what it should be, right? So just seeing that, right? The other is you can do a little reflection because actually all the roads too is made of minerals, right? I mean, it's different form, right? But it's all like rocks and tar and all this stuff, right? So you can play a little game of like the elements that I see around, you know? It's like the air and the tar and the, you know, the water and see that's part of me and part of this too, you know? Kind of reflection like that, right? And the other thing is also just to understand if you're like a person who likes nature to try to get yourself into nature sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So like, let me go to nature in the weekends or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "It's like a little plant area, like natural thing or, you know, in your car even, a little test tube plant."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "We wish this for them as well."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So the train has come that tells us to leave the meditation hall."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "It's a pleasure to be here with you and hope to see you again sometime."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "So for today's Sunday morning talk, I'm very conscious, conscious of the idea that we've been, many of us have been doing shelter in place now for over two months."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And it's a long time and there are plenty of people for whom this time is starting to wear them down."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Contact with people we love has been limited."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And if we remain focused on the externals and what we're frustrated with or upset with or activated by, that we're missing at least half the picture."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "One is to understand it, resolve something that needs to be resolved, or to get a different perspective on what's happening so we can operate more from wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Boredom is an action of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "So some of what goes on at some point is anger."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "If anger is kind of the umbrella term, what are all the manifestations, the subcategories that fit under this general term anger? I have this list here, indignation, annoyance, rage, fury, ire, wrath, hate, irritation, sulking, grumpy, grouchy, resentment, aversion, hostility."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "I called it a clean anger or a clean anger, very clear and clean."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And it was, I said something and someone that I think was maybe disrespectful and the person came back right away and said, Gil, never say that again."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "There's an interesting quote from one of the Desert Fathers."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "They can then begin to overcome it."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And don't kill the messenger."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "But the messenger doesn't have to be the general."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And so then to be able to thank the messenger and then to figure out what is it that needs attention here."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Sometimes we need to see what's going on around us better."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And this ability to make room for our inner life, the different dimensions, aspects of our inner life that comes up, and let it be there."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "But if that person really feels what's going on deeply inside, doesn't only be outward directed, it's really damaging."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "But the important thing to understand that settling our reactivity is not meant to be a repression of ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "We want to hear the message."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And to do my inner work first."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "It'll come back and bite us."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And then no matter how limited your life is, it can be glorious."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "We have to remember that in that time in ancient India there wasn't a Insight Meditation Center down the street."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So the ability to step out of your life in order to go off for a few days, a week, a month to be on retreat, that is possible for some of us here, was probably unthinkable back then."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And what I didn't try was to turn towards my suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And so she's a resolute ardent."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So the Buddha responds this way."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And sometimes it really, what it means is qualities of mind."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So first he tells that these are not what you should regard or hold as what the Dharma, the discipline, or the message is all about."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to contentment, not to discontentment."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to solitude, not to crowds."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "It's reassuring for this chaotic, maybe difficult to understand life that we live, not to have that kind of certainty."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This transforms one to shedding, not to accumulation."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And it can feel somatically that this doesn't feel good."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And if you can do that thoroughly and completely, then whatever, the strong attachment to having the truth, the fear that if I don't have the truth, I'll somehow miss something, will be shed, it will be transformed."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So it's a little bit worthwhile, I think, just going through these things that how you would know this is the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So if you really wanted to read about the Dharma, you'd read your own heart and find these qualities in yourself."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "But rather, I think it's a very mature recognition that the ways in which we get caught in this very strong form of attachment, what Vibhraga is, around desire, kind of a certain kind of attached, powerful passion, that this is a deep part of human life, human being, human psychology to have this."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And so it takes a while, it takes patience, it takes a while to learn how not to be caught in it or how to settle it down."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "But in other contexts, it's a whole different movement, it's a whole different way of being and sensitivity to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And this idea of getting to know ourselves better from the inside out, to have a heightened sensitivity to ourselves, that's, I think, where we continue to discover where the Dharma is and the path for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "It has the word yoga in it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And so as lust, agitated mind, quiets, we start seeing the power of our attachments."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And then it leads to shedding, not accumulation."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "Kutty's are called in the woods."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And to have fewness of desires is a beautiful thing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And my eyesight and my hearing became quite acute."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "Then probably the efforts can be a little more healthy."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So not to be burdened for others."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So that we're not burdened with a lot of time and effort and money and all kinds of things that we need in order to have a lifestyle perhaps that interferes with our ability to do this deep transformative work."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This is the teacher's message."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "We have these running lists, and then we come to practice."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I started seeing all of these parts of myself and I would just put them in two categories."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "So generally speaking, when I walk into a room, I see what's wrong with it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It's kind of bright in here."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "We are not worse than we were."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "Bear in mind for your comfort that we only perceive our malady when the cure begins."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It cut right to my feelings of worth and even my value as a human being."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "This endless violence of how we should be."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "Right now I'm just kind of kicking tires."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "So if we find ourselves in this deep groove in our patterned mind, it's like this hamster wheel of obsessive thought."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "Not turning the practice into another wheel, because this is just another place where we can do that."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "You know, when I was a kid, I can't wait to get out of this house."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I imagine him driving the low rider and I'm in the back."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It feels like, wow, I don't remember leaving the house, but here I am walking in the door again."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I should really remodel this whole thing."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I still chew my fingernails and my refrigerator isn't clean."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "When I give instructions from meditation, I usually add this instruction of you can't do it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "And if that tone is painful to allow ourselves to feel it so that compassion can arise, because that's how compassion works."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It's just like, no, no, just back up a little bit and check out this hell of other people here."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "So where is the attention naturally going? What is naturally being received? What's the next thing our system is naturally receiving? Body sensations, sounds, emotions, maybe thoughts or ideas."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "We can actually be aware of thoughts and ideas, although they do tend to pull us out away from being aware in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "You can leave them in the background, but you don't have to push them away."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "That's the allowing of the conditions to just reveal themselves in that moment."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to What is Already Here", "completion": "What is awareness aware of? We can explore what is already happening, what is being received, exploring this possibility of receptive awareness rather than looking for something to be aware of."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "That's a fairly poverty-stricken world in many senses in that way, isn't it? Now, notice also what's going on, because this will connect with those who are going to come tomorrow, except if I don't put you all off today, is that the."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So we've gone all the way back to link two here, Vedana isn't just Vedana, it's not the feeling of like or dislike."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So I spoke very briefly about what I call discrepancy-based process."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I mean, we had to, in a sense, have some of this stuff to survive as a species."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "If they come to us, fine, but what you guard against is not the sensory perception per se, but the clinging and grasping after the sensory perception."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And so you find within the early texts many examples of ways of trapping monkeys used."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And it's got its paw stuck."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "There's something which is unshakable, which you can pull yourself out, extract yourself with, which is the tree of dhamma that you can hold on to."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "In experience, I've never seen this as being possible, but I'm not saying it isn't, I'm just saying I've never personally seen this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Perhaps I'm being provocative again, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "But we can break it at this link because we can actually see this really, the Vedana immediately giving rise to that tendency to want to crave to avoid or want to crave to have in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I'm doing this very rapidly and then I want to open this up to some questions because there's a lot in this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It doesn't have to be taken literally because you don't need to take it literally."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "But look at the Madhapindika sutta, the honeyball sutta."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "If you've got one pain in your body and you react to that, you'll find another one arises somewhere else, and so you're constantly shuffling around, and if you think of that mentally, that's exactly what we're doing."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I don't even mind repeating this again because I think it's such an important dimension even for those who heard it yesterday."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And for example, it brackets our experience and saying this is my experience, it's not your experience, it's my experience here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Now it's greed, aversion and delusion which of course are helped to reify the self."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Now there's one thing we haven't talked about, and perhaps I'll mention this start on this day, because it's related to this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "How would I put it? They get into such sort of tangles about this notion of emptiness, because this is associated with this, because actually the self is empty."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "What is the empty of? It's empty of any inherent contracted existence."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "That's really, I think, what the Buddha is saying, because, and this is the important part about it from the Buddhist perspective, from his perspective, is that at the moment we are in samsara with all the dukkha, with all of the contractions, with all of the kilesas, all the defilements and everything else that the Buddha speaks about, but we don't have to be it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And if there's other possibility."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "You begin to discern patterns."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "That's what's hijacked it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So, if that's the case, if our intentions can be so easily overrode if we have even good intentions, then we have to start looking at what's going on in the automaticity of this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Rather than being kind of ambushed or taken by surprise, why not kind of be, we've already had a battle plan and an idea or understanding developing around that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I think that is the traditional view."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "If I don't care what people think of me, let's say, if I don't care what people think of me, someone can say, you're not very bright."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Because of my Sankaras, around not being attached to that, I wouldn't experience that as painful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Because they're all interacting with each other."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It's a big comment question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So I think that results in it, and then you get the Hinduization of it in the sense of the coming back into lots of ritual and stuff like that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "He didn't like acetic practices."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "But coming back to the main point you were saying of your question, it's really, really important to find posture and experiment with posture."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "It's an absolutely incredible program."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "So I sent that, a little bit of silence, and then I get back this very sweet email from Robert saying, we've talked about it and we're wondering if you're actually going to be able to do all that in three hours? Should we maybe take some of that stuff out? Do you remember that? And, you know, so here's my thought about this."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "You may find that, you know, you're like, wow, I'm just going to listen to this meditation first, and then maybe I'll explore it again on my own."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "So it begins with awareness of some kind of pain or suffering in yourself or in others or in the world."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "And the other class is a class I teach called the science of compassion, which is a straight-up science lecture on compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "Now, standing is not possible for everybody at every moment."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "You might sense that around the heart."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "Keeping with that quality of stability, once you've made a choice about your position, I will encourage you to stay with it and to allow the body to enter stillness to the best of your ability."}
{"prompt": "The Science and Practice of Compassion (part 1)", "completion": "Now we'll make contact with that quality of the heart by setting an intention."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So it's not exactly a mental note, but we might say a mental reminder, there is a body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And just as I was exploring this, this was a time when IMS was in the middle of its own construction project, and we were building a new building."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And just in the process of framing it, the studs are in for the walls, but before the walls enclose the building, the frame is there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "But you can see through it, so you can see what's going on inside."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Be mindful there is a body to the extent necessary, just to the extent necessary for clear knowing and continuous mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So to ask what is mindfulness, somebody actually asked me, I was sitting in the staff room at IMS and somebody was visiting and they said, can you say just in a few words what mindfulness is? And I thought to myself, it's a bit like asking, you know, what is art? What is love? Please just say in a few words."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "They're basically driving our lives."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It's like the thoughts are like little dictators of the mind when they're not noticed."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "They're just these little energy blips that are completely ephemeral and insubstantial."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So this is quite revolutionary to really understand this about our minds and the nature of a thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And there's a very important distinction to make between perception, the mental factor of perception and mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So we recognize man or woman or house or building or thought."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And the perception can then serve as a vehicle for mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "I created a whole mind world based on a misperception."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So one time I was sitting and I was just going through a lot of sadness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "If there's the filter of aversion, we're looking at it and maybe recognizing it accurately, but wanting it to go away, not liking it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So have you ever made the initial mistake of opening a catalog and then turning pages, waiting for something to want? Nothing on this page, maybe on the next page I'll want something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It took many, many months of being with it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And then I remember I was doing walking meditation, I was actually in the same place I was walking when I was looking at the lampshade."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And it was so interesting, first that phrase, it's okay, if it's here for the rest of my life, it's okay."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "With difficult experiences, I would often remind myself, it's okay."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Okay, it's okay, let it be here."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So one of the little catchphrases I use to watch out for these filters in the mind is to keep an eye out for what I call the in order to mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "We think we're being mindful, but we're not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "He got on my case for calling it a block."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "What was really there, I wasn't experiencing a block."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "There's no sensation called block."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And when I could be just with the tightness and really be accepting of it, then it's possible to see all the nuances of change within the tightness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "In the Abhidharma teachings, mindfulness is a wholesome factor, and it calls all the other wholesome factors to arise with it, and it's never associated with unwholesome factors."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "What's really going on? What factors are arising in the moment? Is it wholesome? Is it unwholesome? Some of you may have heard of coming to contact with Saita Utejnir, a younger Burmese Saita."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "He said that what we frequently think about and ponder upon becomes the inclination of our mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So given that it's really a challenge to us to be mindful of what patterns we perhaps are unconsciously strengthening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "You know, that line is found a lot in the texts, just that one line."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So mindfulness allows us, and this is our practice, mindfulness is in the service of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "They don't have that capacity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Experiencing the mind very directly, not clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And it's why the Buddha declared at the beginning of the sutta, this is the direct path to liberation."}

{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "As we follow this path of practice, as we begin to meditate, as we begin to learn more about the Buddhist teachings, it might seem that our difficulties are sufferings."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "As we become more sensitive and more tuned in to our experience."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So of course, of course every life has periods and situations of great difficulty."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Some are just clearly problems to solve and some actions we can do to take care of it."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And so we're trying to make things difficult."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And maybe they don't have to be problems."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Suppression doesn't really make things go away, it just allows it to pop up in some kind of way."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So it's not a long-term strategy for if we want to have some stable way to find some freedom and happiness."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "We turn towards the difficulties and have what we believed were obstacles to our happiness, obstacles to our well-being and somehow turn them into vehicles, to well-being, to happiness."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "But this idea of turning obstacles into vehicles, so much of the Buddhist path is about this."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "We might have this idea, we have to excise it, we have to remove it, have to get rid of this, have to cut down this poisonous tree so that it doesn't have poisonous fruit."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "When they are encountering some of this aggression or compulsion or greed or hatred that they find in themselves."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "It's kind of the generic words and the Buddhist teaching these are the unwholesome roots that give rise to so many different forms that may be really subtle and may be really strong."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So through respect and understanding, this person sees in a way that's opposite to many people and maybe opposite to many of our first initial reactions with difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So one way to react to difficulties is with compassion."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "This is what it means to have the human experience as suffering, it has difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "But maybe it's a habit to have this view."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And then with this really engaging with the practice, the mind is no longer really thinking about all the difficulties, not obsessed with it in the same way, and the body can start to find some ease."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "There's the knowledge of freedom, the knowledge of liberation, a recognition of what we are free from and a recognition of the way in which that freedom was found, discovered, arose, the way in which that freedom came about."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "And to keep letting go of something and not really take time to really get to know it is a kind of disrespect."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "It's kind of revolutionary."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "It's like the missing link for some people."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "What are the emotions that seem to be behind your thoughts that you have? And see if you can, almost like you're speaking in a different language, see if you can call upon a different part of the mind and start thinking a different way, not pushing away or denying the fact that you maybe are thinking with a lot of fear, anxiety, or whatever it might be for you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "But see today whether you can kind of shift and change and pay attention to your mind and find if there's different ways of thinking and in the process begin to de-identify with one particular way."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's a way of sort of shifting the mind, right? There's also a kind of discernment process happening there."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "Pretty much anything that's not a hindrance or greed, hatred, and delusion could be you can find the beneficial in it if it's not just beneficial on its base."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "So learning and knowing the conditions that are helpful for cultivating a wholesome state is a discernment process in and of itself."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "And this is in cultivation of what's known as the immeasurables or the Brahma viharas, four facets of Buddhist love."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "And they are metta or loving kindness, karuna or compassion, muddita or altruistic or empathetic joy, and upekkha, a kind of big picture equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then the more mindfulness approach, it can be stepping back and intentionally cultivating a kindly attitude towards anything that arises, or a compassionate attitude, or noticing what's joyful and experienced, and allowing the field of awareness itself to be informed by that, and then anything that comes up that isn't that becomes much more obvious."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "So now we've talked about the cultivating piece, a lot of which is moving from other states or shifting our attitude and relationship to other states."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "Really, maybe I'm practicing cultivating loving kindness and the hardest is feeling dry and there's not a lot going on."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "Encouraging kindness, patience, spaciousness, and allowing for whatever's there."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And these are lessons that we explore in our spiritual practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "So this art, this both science, this art of turning inward, and there are beautiful examples in the book how John Leland's teachers, these people over 80, 85, for example, when one person is not able to go out to, you know, to have an outing, and then he decides he's actually happy in his apartment turning on the TV and having ice cream, which he's not, he's not supposed to have."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "But there's a sense of contentment instead of thinking, oh, they didn't pick me up, they fell through, like there was a sense of happiness or the sense of peace, their sense of peace with, with the simple pleasures, with the simple joys, with the simple, actually, miracles of life."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And it's a training, we train ourselves with us, as the Buddha invites us, we train ourselves, we train our attention, we train our attention here, right now, right here, the mystery, the miracle of this moment, sort of the past, the future, we have choice."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Releasing, letting go of the thoughts of the past, what has come into now, until now, preoccupations, and thoughts of the future."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "This right now, let's, let's release, release, letting go of these helium balloons, let them float."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "One is that the sense of contentment, the sense of enoughness, this contentment, the sense of peace, that can arise, which might have arisen for you even just a little bit to taste it, this meditation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "I was tasting it, I didn't want to ring the bell, I was like, oh, this is enough, yes, the body is in pain, but this is great, this is plenty."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And again, not to say that this is the state that you may want to have every moment of your life, not suggesting that you give up every intention or desire, that's not the idea here."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Sharing for the benefit of the Sangha, your insight, your aha moments, and also for the benefit of yourself to be held witness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "So take it away, what happened? What did you notice? Was there any peace? Was this moment enough for anyone? Did you notice the bliss of peace? Or not? Or maybe you're just too quiet to talk."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Whoever's giving a thumbs up, would you like to raise your hand and say something? Oh, it went away, the thumbs up."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Thank you so much, Aurora, for, for saying, for sharing your insight and the practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "That's what needs to happen."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "So my recommendation is make space for the jangling nerves for the rallying quarters, like, oh yeah, it's like this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "The two can coexist and the moment you see that, there's a person who wrote whose practice is not regular yet, the moment you see that jangling and jangling can be together coexistent with peace and contentment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Whoever shows up in the room tonight is the right person, is this person that you're supposed to be talking, listening to these special individuals."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "What I'm really trying to do here is to suggest that we have anomalous texts."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "When the fully knowing of suffering exists, the letting go of craving comes to be."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Now, in that way, we can see how the Four Truths are a translation of the principle of conditioned arising, or conditioned emergence, or dependent origination, that constitutes what the Buddha described as the key to his awakening."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "There's no question about that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That's a very strong claim."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "When you cut off the sources of rebirth, only then are you no longer going to suffer."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Ouch! But of course, sukkha in Buddhism is also seen as a kind of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Are you familiar with this? This is the third and the fourth of the twelve links."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That is constantly interacting and giving rise to consciousness."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "It is what we do when we suffer."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "What we do in kind of most of the day, probably, we're trying to get this and get rid of that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That's not the end of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But the point is, the Buddha is embedded in a world that he cares for."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In some of the Mahayana texts, and I'm particularly thinking of my favorite Mahayana text, which is the Bodhicharya avatar that guide to the bodhisattva's way of life, an eighth century poem by Shanti Deva."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "It's the moment in which you know you do not have to live your life driven by the prompts of your attachments and your aversions and your fears and your hatreds."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I do not have to rush after things with attachment."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I'm free not to do those things."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That is, announcing teaching, describing, establishing, revealing, expounding, and exhibiting these Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Is that really a very appropriate or helpful way to deal with Auschwitz? It sounds nice in the abstract."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That is, I think, a primary sort of commitment, really, that one would have to have in following this kind of path."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "This is not just something for a particular type of person."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "To me, it's a fairly, it can be an inspirational idea."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I find it helpful to think that I have the capacity to be more awake in every moment and to see the Buddha as an example of what a human life could be."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But frankly, I think it could also be a way in which you could somehow, a device of failing to acknowledge the actual pain and suffering and imperfection and confusion of a person's life."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Ashoka did address some of his edicts to the Buddhist community."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "First of all, I want to say that I find this extremely interesting and it's a refreshing take on the four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Certainly one can do that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But if you don't have the attachment to those things, they still happen."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "The problem with craving is it causes you suffering."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Now the problem with māra, māra is that which limits and in a sense almost destroys our capacity to live fully."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "That kind of power struggle led to the kind of schools."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So a lot of work, and this book refers to that, a lot of work is being done to compare the Pali canon with the Agamas, which are a Chinese translation of the Sarvastavada canon."}

{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "Home being where we're free and liberated."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "And so there are these four areas to abide observing, the body, the feelings, mental states, and the mind and mental processes."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "So that was a general introduction to this series we're going to do, and hopefully we'll practice with it during the 30-minute meditation, and then have some teachings around it each of these weekday days for the next few weeks."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And so this is perhaps some of what we're hoping for the New Year that there'll be a little more safety, a little less chaos, perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "The traditional stating of the refuges in the Buddhist tradition is that we take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha."}

{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "So how do we do this, though? I mean, this is not easy and certainly, when I first met Buddhist practice, you know, I didn't really understand in some ways what I was stepping into."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "They're really kind of three aspects of one refuge."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "But I think that the real, the true refuge in the Buddha has to do, at least for me, the sense is that he figured this out, right? He didn't have somebody helping him."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And the peace that was the transformative peace was this power of waking up, the power of being aware, being aware of the experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And so taking refuge in the Buddha, to me, is really taking refuge in our capacity to be awake."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "The mindfulness wasn't very continuous."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And so we can take refuge in those, the understanding that we can gain through the reading, the listening, the learning and the engagement with those, those practices."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "The deeper taking refuge in the Dharma, the word Dharma also means nature."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And then the mind gets confused again and goes off looking for some place to find some stability."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And then the third, the refuge in the Sangha."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "It's not an easy path to follow."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So good morning everyone and we can live in a world where we're quick to think that things are wrong or we can live in a world where we are present on the main road for what is not taking the side roads."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And in not taking any side roads, it's very present for what is without any being forward against or any preoccupation, any thinking about it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So I think what we'll do today is just continue and I will just, I can see the blinking out and I'll just, as I said, I'll just kind of pause and most of them are pretty short."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And the opposite of this kind of doubt, confusion, and uncertainty is, I think of it as trust."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And when the mind starts going down a side path, remembering, oh, that's a side path just a year."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "The path to trust is the path of just being present for this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And so if there's anything that happens that, well, this is happening, this is happening, this is happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "We don't have to solve our problems."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "It also teaches us how much we complicate things unnecessarily because the radical simplicity of meditation kind of highlights the complications, highlights how we bear away."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And the path of mindfulness is, in the Satipatana, is simply to know, oh, this is confusion."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "To see it arise, to see it be present, to see it absent, to see it as a hindrance in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Quickly, quickly, then we'll switch over to Zoom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Unhealthy doubts are the ones that keep us indecisive or confused or hesitant in a way that without the kind of forward-leaning or forward-going questioning and wondering what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And so it'd be able to distinguish healthy and unhealthy."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "We get a feel for the sense of trust and clarity when we're just staying on the main road."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "It has other meanings as well, but in this context it appears to simply mean no experience."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "That understanding of this is what it's like to have the experience of anger doesn't preclude acting and like changing the environment to say, you know, alter some situations, alter the environment, but it's rather than acting out of the reactivity of anger, there's the container in which there's the understanding of what anger is, how it functions, how it ripples out, how it tends to perpetuate anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And so there's sometimes is a misunderstanding in what mindfulness is."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I mean, mindfulness is simply this recognition of kind of the reflective of this is what's happening in the present moment as an experience in the present moment, but people often take that teaching to mean, and you don't do anything with it, and you don't respond."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And so what I found, at least in my own practice, is that when I'm more available to really know what is here in the present moment, there's more wisdom available to respond in a skillful way."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "This is what it feels like."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So I spent a couple of months really getting familiar with that, getting familiar with what is this experience of anger and how is it, you know, how has it felt to suffering and just that, just that exploration was very powerful because I did notice over the course of a couple of months that the, the anger started like it's like the mindfulness broke in to the pattern of anger earlier and earlier in the cycle of anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And I began to notice it's not as painful to be not as angry, you know, yeah, it's still painful, but it's boy, was it painful when I was in that rage."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And it struck me as I remembered through this whole experience of the insights that happened around the anger that they happened in the order of the four noble truths as they're stated."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And in my own experience, sometimes they're really simple."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "That was, that was a couple months later."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And the next thing I saw was not something, again, none of this was something I did, but the next thing I saw was the mind recognize heading towards anger, that's going to hurt."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So in that moment, the mind understanding, that's going to lead to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "Something in the system, like this was where the wisdom that had been developing over the previous months of seeing anger and understanding right inside the being, this is going to hurt, this is suffering, the mind let go of that intention to that direction to anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So again, the first, the first understanding was this is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "It's like, I saw something, it's not something I do, but it's coming out of the conditions of practicing mindfulness and being curious about suffering, being curious about experience as present moment experience."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So that understanding into the path, it's like it wasn't the very ending of my suffering around anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And so that really led to a real like engagement with the path."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And so for instance, the mindfulness of breathing, the first instruction in the Satipatanasuta, there's a whole suit to devoted to mindfulness of breathing that describes it as being a complete path in and of itself."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "But the key really is the mindfulness, the being present with experience as experience in the present moment, kind of like I described that distinction with anger about knowing that there's anger and, you know, kind of following the anger versus knowing, oh, this is what anger is like in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "He's talking about continuity of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I mean, just that, just that example of that, that moment of seeing how the anger didn't arise."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "We often think about concentration as being focused on one thing and there is a form of concentration that is that in the Buddhist tradition."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And there's a form of concentration that is just the simple continuity of mindfulness without distracted, non-distracted awareness is a form of concentration and it can be for a few moments, it can be for a longer stretch of time."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "Next week is going to be a stepping back for context week where explore kind of how concentration or sort of like how concentration is supported by all of the factors of the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "There's a particular teaching in the suttas that I want to refer to that speaks about how all the path factors, all of the factors of the Eightfold Path, wise view, wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration, how they weave together and support each other and create the conditions for wise concentration, which leads to that, that concentrated mindfulness, that undistracted mindfulness as the Buddha promised at the end of the Satipatanasuta, that is leading in the direction of releasing greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And it's a great practice to, to begin to recognize when we're not suffering because it's a kind of subtle thing sometimes actually, like, you know, sometimes a great place to notice that is when it feels like nothing's happening, like sitting at a stop sign or sitting at a stoplight, you know, maybe, maybe what your mind is doing is projecting into, you know, where you need to get to or things you need to do and you're frustrated by the red light."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I've got plenty of time to get there."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So, but it's a great exploration."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "Joy is dukkha, but not in the terms of suffering, in the terms of this unreliability."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And I'm delighted to teach this course."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But other than that, the whole day, they did have a break."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But if you try to look at a star or look at the moon in a big telescope you're holding in your hand, you can't hold it still enough to really get it into focus, the object."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And if you go to a wonderful sacred temple for some very special occasion, you might dress well, you might clean yourself first, take a nice bath, you're ready."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so for me, I think of Samadhi as kind of akin to being a temple."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But I kind of, you might not agree with how I'm wording it here or how I'm describing it, but I really associated more like going into, like I said, into a temple, into a sacred place where you want to really, almost natural to go into it with a degree of humility, a degree of reverence, a degree of care and attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "That when I, when concentration kicks in for me, the samadhi kicks in, I really feel like it's a gift."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And that's why the word concentration is a little bit difficult in English."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But samadhi itself is more of a state that we enter into."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "In strong states of concentration that I've had, I've actually, the physical feelings in my body that I've had is one of coursing of healing energy through my body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But this is so healing, it's so good to have this kind of flow through."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And I think now there's lots of supposedly clinical evidence that being de-stressed is good for your immune system, for your health, for all kinds of things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "In Buddhist practice there's a number of, maybe three primary benefits that are talked about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "All the inner messages that we're telling ourselves all the time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so to be able to stop all that, quiet all that down and work through all that and settle beyond it, even if it takes years, is a really noble thing to do, a wonderful thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But to realize, you don't have to have any of that stuff."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So the concentration kind of prepares the ground to make it easier to develop these beautiful qualities we have that are a lot harder to develop if we're distracted and cut up in all kinds of preoccupations."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Some people develop very strong mindfulness that can also lead to liberation, but they don't have some of the benefits of the container of joy or well-being of wholeness that can make it a lot easier to let go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But one of them is to have desire."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And some people have this really strongly, that's their specialty."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "However long it takes, I'm committed."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So there's maybe a variety of different mental faculties that come along with, that are associated with this idea of desire, chanda."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Another is some people have a lot of a very pure mind, or pure soul or something."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "When people's inner life is very pure, very sincere, it's a lot easier to drop in because they're not being pulled around by their greed and their hate and their confusion and their fear."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "sometimes translated as courageous effort."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I associate it with, for myself, with persistence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Like myself, I don't think of myself the way I kind of lived, grew up in whatever my."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So someone else like me, persistence works for me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And that wasn't my strength when I started practicing persistence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then as I said, this idea of desire or intentness, that's some people's strength."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Some people have beginner's luck with meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "It's so special and so wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I've known some people who have a playful mind and they get concentrated by doing it playfully."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I had to do something to get sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "You might find yourself then a little bit more with your chest and your spine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then with your eyes closed, it can be helpful to take a few long, slow, deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Take a few moments to feel this, your whole chest, upper back."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then as you exhale, relax and soften the rib cage, chest."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And as you exhale, softening the belly, that whole region, maybe even letting the belly fall forward."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "To allow the thinking mind to settle down, relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "You might see if any one of these or some of them resonate for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So, it's kind of like that with our attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I've done this a lot where I kind of congratulate myself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And if you do that, what'll happen is that a certain kind of thinking will stop, will not be fed, and you won't be involved in it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I wonder if now, I've kind of been watching my breath for a while, I wonder what it's like if I feel it instead, this physical sensuality of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So it is a kind of thinking, but it's thinking about the thing you're focusing on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so now you're using, that's part of the attentional faculties we have, is to have the attention, the thinking be about what we're focusing on."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Try to look a little bit and see what is it to be fully here, not split, not thinking about other things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Because it's very important to notice that's a split attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And this is what it's like to be fragmented and be split and not really be present."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And the other is that you kind of begin to see the landscape better."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "In the outer hall? No, it is okay."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So that your anxiety doesn't hijack you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And also the main thing we teach here at IMC is mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "You're attentive to it, like to the anxiety, but you're not caught by it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "They'll have you sit there and tap your leg and arm."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Yeah, so some people, the movement of the breathing, that's the movement they'll use."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so that's another option for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "That's exactly how I feel."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "That when people think there has to be the single laser focus, it's kind of like, take my hand here, and I have my hand open and flat, and then all the fingers come together to a point, and I hold it tense, and then I'm kind of going like this at the object of attention, attacking it kind of."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But it's kind of a very nice description, I think."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Our minds have amazing potentials."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Purified, bright, clean, unblemished."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "What I'd rather do is to say that we want to use the Samadhi teachings and the understanding and to begin understanding some of the different ways in which we can engage our mind, how our mind works, how we can use the different faculties of the mind for our own benefit."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "But what I didn't realize when I was young and starting out, that how much I was actually going to learn about love."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Sometimes it's emphasized a little bit more in this tradition, we're called insight meditation, that mindfulness is the key to ultimate reality and that is true as well."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "He didn't say particularly the mind, but the release of the heart, which is where our suffering is most often experienced."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "So as we practice these qualities of the heart or we awaken these qualities of the heart, what we find is that we become reunited."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "And that any moment of kindness or love or compassion is a moment of connection and connection in any moment dissolves separation and duality."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "And as Stephen still said, love the one you're with, and that's the one you're with from birth to death."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "But most of us are subtly or not so subtly actually hooked in various patterns of self-rejection, various patterns of self-criticism, of self-negation."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "What is the self inside us, the silent observer, severe and speechless critic who can terrorize us and urge us on to futile activity and in the end judge us still more severely for the errors to which his own reproaches drove us? In working with people around compassion and self-compassion, it's pretty common for people to say, you know, it's actually pretty easy for me to feel compassion to others, but it's much harder to myself."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "And there's many reasons for that."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Certain beings, certain places, certain experiences, we're willing to offer compassion, but there are many other situations where we are not willing to offer compassion to others and that it becomes the same with ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Simply put, if you do not believe, at least some of the time, if you do not believe that you deserve love, then you actually do not believe that others deserve love."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "They are self-judgment and self-criticism."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Self-compassion does not try to capture or define the worth or essence of who we are."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "The problem with these, where affirmations can go bad, is they can really tap in again to the sense of deficiency and insufficiency that many of us carry around, that I'm not okay and I should be this other way or life should be something other than it is."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "It can turn again into the endless self-improvement cycle rather than the possibility of the profound self-acceptance, freedom."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "In this book, Kristen talks about what she calls, and in the research they work with this and studies and so forth, the three aspects of self-compassion which I think are simple and basic and useful."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Mindfulness is our ability to actually be present and open and connected to what our experience is without judgment."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "Well then, love your suffering, do not resist it, do not flee it, it is your version that hurts, nothing else."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "So you're actually recalling it, you're inviting it into your mindfulness, into your presence."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "So if it feels good to, at this point, to be aware of even self-contact, meaning holding your own hand or a comforting hand on your leg or even over your own heart."}
{"prompt": "Self Compassion", "completion": "And again, I'm instructed to end on time, so I'm going to do that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "So, I'd like to invite you to get into your meditation posture."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "Letting a relaxed, soft body receive the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "I am of the nature to sicken."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "Let the thinking, the proliferation go."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "All that is mine, beloved and pleasing, will change, will become otherwise, will become separated from me."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "The last one specifically, the intention is to have a sense of non-attachment, to know that it will be separated, to encourage a non-attachment, a letting go, a freedom, a generosity of the heart, to be with, to appreciate, to enjoy, to love both people and things, appreciate them, enjoy them but not have a sense of clinging or grasping, to know that it's a part of life."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "So the striker, I can cling to it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "I'm just using it for now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "So it seems like a step from death."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "So with this one, I'll just share with you maybe the next time I teach, maybe I'll try doing it as number four, the canonical order to see how that lands for people."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The 5th Reflection; Dharmette: I Will be Separated From All That Is Dear To Me", "completion": "And one last thing I want to say before stopping is to say that the idea of the first one, I have not gone beyond aging, is to overcome the conceit of youth, of energy, vitality."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "In a way that expresses your intention to be meditating right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "In a simple, relaxed, easy way, we can just bring our awareness to the sensations of the body of what it's like to be here right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "In a simple, relaxed way, notice what the hands are touching."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "Perhaps the feeling of the air going in and out of the nose."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And we can also notice the sensations of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "Just very simply, gently begin again."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "We don't need to add anything extra."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "As I said, doubt and lack of confidence, the fifth."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Do you remember the first obstacle? What we said is the one that is most common and constantly appears in our lives, appears in the first place in many of the lists."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Any obstacle that arises, if I see it and realize that it's not harmful, that I'm not going to harm anyone, and consciously I do it because there is no problem, it's great."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "First, I want you to be clear about what Dharma is."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Dharma is Buddhist teachings."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Now, we also bring discernment at the time of desire, if it's something that's able or not able, if it's something that I'm going to bring to the end or not."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "The second of the obstacles, who remembers? It's the opposite, the opposite of sensual desire."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "When I'm in meditation with something that I don't want, we tend to, even if it's slightly, move the body back."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "What I'm covering is that in reality, something here with me goes wrong."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "That's where that term comes from, Nivarana, covering something, covering something."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Do you remember that I gave you the example, that if you take a child to the supermarket and the child starts, I'm tired, I feel bad, I'm tired, I'm bored."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "And in one of those, you say, do you want an ice cream? And the child suddenly is no longer tired, or his feet hurt, or his stomach hurts."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "It no longer has something positive, it has already become an obstacle."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Imagine how wonderful it is to be able to connect with this, with this tranquility, the depth."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Now, the last obstacle, which is doubt and lack of confidence."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "So doubt keeps us in constant vacillation, which prevents us from acting."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "So this leads to abandoning the practice."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "So you have to survive the doubt."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "It is extremely important in this practice."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "And these are for the five."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "Let's see if there are any questions."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "This is an event that happens with people who have practiced for many, many years."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "And that is what obstacles are."}
{"prompt": "Los Cinco Obstáculos: Duda y Falta de Confianza", "completion": "So, I hope to see you all again very well."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Some people might describe it as a paradigm shift from one way, one whole world view, a way of looking at oneself and the world to a whole other one."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Sometimes it takes years and years for that to happen."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And there's other things to pay attention to besides thinking."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "You know, I know these things are important."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "In the foreground of attention, at some point in meditation, the foreground can be the sense of well-being and calm and subtleness and peace that comes maybe from focusing on your breath or getting settled or having mindfulness be strong."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "So you understand, hopefully you understand that a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It gets more interesting though, this paradigm shift that can happen."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It actually diminishes us rather than keeps us open."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "We're actually short-changing ourselves in being self-centered or self-preoccupied or being selfish, oddly enough, and paradoxically enough."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And so at some point, we start seeing that the activity, the thinking activity, the contractions in the mind, the emotions that are connected to this self-oriented kind of approach to life, we start getting losing interest in that as well."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It's not saying that you shouldn't have a kind regard towards yourself."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It's saying that at some point, as the meditation gets quieter and stiller, and this process of losing interest in thoughts happens because there's a better thing going on, we realize there's a better thing going on than being self-centered, that being self-preoccupied, self-cut up."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And so there's a loss of interest in selfing, loss and interest in being self-preoccupied."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "What I'm trying to point out is that as this process of meditation goes along, what you'll learn at some point, what we hope you'll learn at some point, that there is another game in town."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "There's a time and place for everything."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Time and place to allow ourselves to experience and live from a very different paradigm, very different orientation."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And part of the situation is the wider world, what goes on around us."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It was a seven-day retreat, we sat in the same place next to each other."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And in the course of this particular retreat, every afternoon we were served tea."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "He had the tea cup, empty tea cup in front of him."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Who ever thought bowing to a cup? But it was the presence and the sense of kind of care and maybe the sense of, maybe gratitude he had for that cup, he had a relationship to that cup over those seven days under meditation retreat."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And somehow he acknowledged it with his bow, that presence for it."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And so it was situation-centered, he was really there for that event."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "He wasn't like, you know, thinking about the servers coming down and, you know, this server is probably going to judge me about how I put the cup on the tray and I better kind of calculate where to go in the tray so that I, they think well of me and I'm a Zen monk after all from Japan and everything's, you know, what they think of me is important."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And it was a delicacy to just be there with the person serving tea."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It taught me that when we're situation-centered without this preoccupation in self, without preoccupation with the others, that there is a responsivity."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "People who are caught up in their thoughts and their concerns, it's very easy to get impatient and very easy to kind of, you know, where's the point in life and what's going on and I have important things to do and I have projects to do and important things to think and fantasize about and all kinds of things, right? And so in that frustration or that desiring and wanting, it could seem like it's the last thing you want to do is to stop fully and not let the thinking race ahead for the next thing and the next thing."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It's another thing to lose interest in the self-preoccupating thoughts in daily life when there's so much pressure to think and do and get everything."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And it can be as simple as being busy and doing things and recognizing your thinking and caught up in something."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "So you mentioned several times the sense of constriction and limitedness in thinking about self."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Then, oh, I'll do this and that, I'll save the world, and I can be the great savior or I'll build a big house and something."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "A great place that many people who meditate on retreats, I don't know if everyone does this, but I've had it certainly, caught up in some kind of great fantasy."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "The mindfulness should ideally be 360 degrees."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "It should be all inclusive."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And then it keeps going, goes out into the world."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "There's a kind of a blinder's on or preferential attention going on if we're out there, othering with the world, taking care of people, doing things, and not including what's here as part of the picture."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "What I taught today was mostly meant, for some of you, to be kind of like a highlight of what will come naturally by itself."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And we learn and work through it and resolve it and settle it."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "Is this when he says, when he talks about relaxing the bodily formations? That's it, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "So it's really hard for me to stop thinking by catching my thoughts and saying, stop."}
{"prompt": "Alternatives to Thinking", "completion": "And toothpaste is good in small little dosages."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "So, good morning to you all."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "I'm happy to be with you all, and I trust we'll feel each other's hearts, and that'll be plenty."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "Michelle McDonald, I believe, said equanimity is the courage of low expectations, which is very funny."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "It sounds tiring, yeah? It sounds tiring."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "And so this is the focus of the week."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "And so if greed is the kind of hole in the center of your being and hatred feels like your heart is on fire, what is delusion? Well, delusion feels exactly like the truth, until it doesn't."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "It serves to justify and dignify the forces of greed and hatred."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "We develop equanimity with greed, with aversion, and this makes the kind of delusion that serves to make that disappear, to make it look like wisdom, to make it look like fun."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And then after a while you're aware that it really hurts."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "The truth of suffering there, the pain there, and the truth of the possibility of release are seen together at the same time."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And all of the whole world of realization, of enlightenment, of liberation, of freedom from suffering, of relief, of release, it's possible is kind of subsumed under this Third Noble Truths of what's called cessation."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Sometimes they're unpleasant memories, and sometimes they're pleasant ones, and I had both."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "That's a little bit unusual, a little bit different than a normal way in which we live."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But I didn't really see it as a possibility for what I could live in, or be like most of the time, or kind of touch into more often."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But, you know, I didn't suffer too much because of it."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Apparently in ancient India, people who had leprosy, which caused you to itch and feel really bad in your skin, they would put their hand or their body into fire, because fire somehow cauterized, I don't know what it did, but it somehow made it feel better, it was a relief compared to what they were feeling."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But in a relationship to a normal arm, it's not a relief."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So you see the possibility, but you don't know how."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So, you know, but I think it's like it has this elegance."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So the Buddha wanted to avoid any kind of metaphysical quagmire, he called it, and offer something that was free, that maze that we get into, you never get out of perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So it begins with something we can experience, the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "You know you don't have it, you don't have much of it, you see that's possible."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "It doesn't reside in out there."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And here you're told you've got to understand your suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But it's much more understandable when you get the good news first."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And then eventually you can kind of move it down and do more weight and then more weight and more weight and then more weight."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And then, you know, more weight until finally, you know, you realize that you can't go any further."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And they will come to us to teach you, for example, and say, well, what do I do now? Well, you can give people advice."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But if they've been building that muscle for the few years before that crisis, they might have had the skills and the ability to understand what's going on that they don't have because they weren't practicing all along."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Don't wait until a crisis."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So the Buddha said it's important to look at our behavior, and to live a life that is supportive of developing the deepest form of well-being a human person can."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So it might take a long time to develop and explore the Eightfold Path, these eight steps, and to integrate them into our life, so they become a really good support for being able to do this looking and suffering and letting go of the cause."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Seeing the path that's in suffering, the cause of suffering, and the release from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "The theme that I like to invite us to practice with to work with is opening up our perspective, opening up our perspective as if you were sitting on the top of a proverbial mountain and looking at the entire, entire trajectory of your life."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Not just this moment, yes, we will be embodied in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Letting go of all the words, letting go, letting go of the words, letting go of any thoughts, just arriving in the body, in the tender sensations of this body sitting, this amazing miracle of life."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "And if thoughts arise, it's okay, they will, they do, not a problem, not a problem."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Let's come back later, not now, come back later."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Being in the body can help expand our vision, not being in our heads."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Be the center of your joyful attention."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "With our bodies, we perceive the arc of our lives, the arc having been born."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "That's the door we're entering tonight, but as if you were that newborn."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "We're just at a state of peace and equanimity, letting go."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Maybe even saying goodbye to the body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "This body that is me and also not me, this being is so much more magnificent."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Letting your heart, inviting perhaps, inviting gently, your heart to include all of these beings, all these slices of this being."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "So many dimensions are humanity and divinity, loving and being loved."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "And as we bring this, sitting to a close, maybe in your mind's eye, bowing to yourself, your divinity bows to you, you bow to your inner Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Otherwise, I will not see you because I only see just a few of you because of privacy since this is on YouTube, since I'm on spotlight, I only see very few people, not every one of you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "What did you notice? What came up for you? What happened? Karen says, I found it so interesting and mysterious to reflect on how I am, and also I'm not the same self at different ages."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "It was, it was a good it's been a good life."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "I, I also really like that looking at the arc of my life and it's helpful to not get too caught up in whatever is the Sherman drama that's happening right now."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Yes, I did drop that in and and how how for you that ignited something in your heart in in appreciation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "They can be so supportive."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So I wanted to, you know, given the format of this class being such a short time for a talk, I want to just do a kind of a brief overview of this today and then we'll see how it goes over the coming weeks, you know, whether we want to get into any one of them more specifically or not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I think the main association I had with this word was through like geology of like aggregate rock, you know, that what is an aggregate rock though, you know, basically it's a rock made of other rocks."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So it's kind of just a bunch of rock glommed together of other pieces of rock."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "It's just basically five heaps of things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "You know, the, the aggregate rock is created by being aggregated, by being put together, you know, all these pieces of rock are put together, they are aggregated to make an aggregate."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "There's, there's the process and then there's the set of things that it processes, I guess we could say."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So every experience that we have, you know, the Buddha basically described these five processes and the entirety of our human experience is happening through these five processes."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "There's no other part of experience that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And the Buddha, part of the reason the Buddha points to this and encourages us to understand this, is because that weaving together of experience that our minds do, very naturally, you know, our minds very quickly weave together a stabbing in a particular location of the body that's experienced as unpleasant, you know, as the knee that's painful and reacts to it with aversion, oh that happens in a split second."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "We identify with those very strongly."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I mean, for myself, before I met the practice, I really strongly identified as being a miserable person."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And when we are selfing, we are clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And so it's got more of the I component in there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "The clinging may more have a visceral sense of need or want or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "Because as we look at our experience in this way, and even look at what we think of as a sense of self in this way, we see it's just an arising experience that's got these various threads to it that are weaving together."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And then as you, as you see that, you start seeing how, for instance, the feeling tone, we, you know, when we experience something pleasant, we might start to recognize there's a difference between a pleasant feeling, and then the liking of it, and the need to have more of it, or there's a difference between, there's something unpleasant, and the desire to get away from it, or the desire, you know, the feeling of a version towards it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So unpleasant experience, strong aversion."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And this also begins to undermine the sense that I'm doing any of this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "Andrea, I have a simple one."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "Well, if nobody else has a question, I can ask one more."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So kind of like the river bed is containing the river, but that river bed is also fluctuating and moving."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I would almost call the container."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So that, you know, the force of conditioning, the force of, you know, the next moment of experience arising, independence on the prior moment of experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "It's not, you know, it's a container more like a magnetic field as a container."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "There's a whole new set of cells every seven years."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "We had a huge earthquake in 89."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "This is not, you know, being negative or whatever."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It's easy to acknowledge as a theory or, you know, as a thought, oh yeah, right, I know, I know, but to actually face that we will die or that our loved one will die, often people say it's easier to accept that I will die than it is that my loved ones will die."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I'm remembering back when I was young, my mother was caught in this thinking that people are a certain way."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And she said, and I thought this was so touching."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And he brought with him a reading or a writing that he uses when he does weddings."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I do remember hearing it a lot."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And if you hear something, you tend to adopt it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Sure, there was a shy part of me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And that's one that's often given as an example in Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I get this beautiful bouquet at Farmers Market."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And it's just one thing after another."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "One is traveling and photographing throughout the West and mountains."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It's very hard to do, but you can see when you look at a mountain, some more than others, that these huge blocks of stone are actually moving."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Yes, and I think compassion for ourselves when we recognize that, you know? It's, I don't know, it's hardwired perhaps."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "We want things to be predictable."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So the hardest thing, and coming here I was thinking about it, the hardest thing for me is when they're having one of those really horrible mood swings when they're acting so badly is for me not to look at them and think, how am I going to do this until they're like 18 years old and what about boarding schools and I don't know if I can do this and it's just like it seems so permanent."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Thank you for speaking about having compassion for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And then I notice just the light as it changes throughout my house during the day and then at the end of the day when my kids come home and yesterday we were outside all playing on the lawn and the way the light plays on the plants and then sinks below the hills and then the energy and the feeling that comes from that change is fascinating to me because I sense when this is happening and I don't know exactly how to describe it, but as the sun goes down and light gets darker and we come in and it's time for food and book reading and homework and snuggles and all those things that happen more in the darkness and less in the energy of the bright day."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Now it will change and become such a tiny sliver and then become full again."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And yet if you watch, you can find again beauty in every stage of the moon."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Well, yeah, we all do in some way, I think."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Clinging is, to me, that's the thing that causes the most suffering for me."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And you know, that's what Buddhism is about."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "That's a huge shift, a huge shift in perception."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "But look at the happiness it brings."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And the reality is we can't control things around us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "You can't control, as you said, how your children are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And that points to another change that often we don't like to acknowledge or see."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Again, we like to think that this is how our relationship is, whether it's romantic or our children or friends or whatever."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "This is how it is and this is how it will always be."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "But in truth, relationships evolve and change just like everything else."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And it's been through the practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "But don't be somebody else and come along."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And I think this is one reason that the MBSR, mindfulness based stress reduction program, has been so successful and so helpful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "You know, now there's pressure, and now there's a pulling, and now there's heat, and now there's nothing."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And perhaps seeing the tendency to resist, the tendency to want to make it go away, which is natural, of course."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It seems to me that change is inextricably linked to time."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So again, working with our comparing mind, noticing the comparing mind and the suffering, the unhappiness that that can bring."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So then you only have to have one calendar? That's right."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Another thing that recognizing the changing nature, or as Rick Hansen says, the fragility of things, can help us or can lead us to take care, to take care of things, whether it's relationships or things, knowing that it could break at any time, anything, anything we have, like the story of Ajahn Chah, who had his favorite cup and always used this cup."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "But anger arising will tend to, it has a, it has a kind of a shaping power to it, it shapes our experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "It will shape the perception to kind of orient to recognizing or, or, or interpreting experience to perceive it as though perhaps we're being attacked."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So it kind of shapes the things that we become aware of as well."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So that, that that, again, with, but, but the, the identification is around that I am the one who is feeling these pleasant unpleasant experiences."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "And then mental formations, he says this volitional aspect, volitional formations are why I am doing what I'm doing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "We identify with consciousness is like, oh yes, I am the one who knows."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Or I'm identifying with being the one in the one who knows, or I'm identifying with being the angry one or whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "I mean, and that that that mind state of miserableness being identified with was kind of, you know, a belief of you that I am always miserable."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "That's a belief that is kind of overlaid on experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "It's just the feeling of the I am this, but the belief, this is who I am, the Buddha highlighted this as a particular useful exploration, it's kind of like the largest or the most outer levels of identification that happen."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "He basically says that there's four ways that we can identify with any of the five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "He assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or the self, or the form as in the self, or the self as in form."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "I can imagine something like that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So let's look at feeling, you know, the feeling tone, for instance."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Well, that's a mental formation for me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "But what I would say is perhaps it what makes the most sense in terms of an exploration like this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So those those four things, the equating of I am X."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "And yet it just being a process doesn't mean that it doesn't have an effect on us."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Those things shape experience whether we identify with them or not."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "I mean, it's when it comes to this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "You know, some sometimes the strongest identities that we have are the hardest to see in a way, because they're so conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Oh yeah, it came up there when I was in the grocery store and I looked at that person and thought that thing."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so the recognition of it helps support our being able to recognize it more often and more easily and actually also begins to support our ability to recognize mindfulness more in the flow of being aware, not just in the moment when mindfulness returns."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "But this moment of mindfulness returning is also a really powerful practice in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And if you can begin to get familiar with it in the sitting practice, you might then also begin to get familiar with it in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "One might just be to simply kind of take in, you know, that you are aware, that's a big piece of it, oh, awareness is back, this is what mindfulness feels like."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's difficult to know how to relate to the rest of the world now."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "My sense of self seems less real now, which could be helpful, but the rest of the world also seems less real in a way that doesn't seem wholesome."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "The other side that's pointed out by this question is the rest of the world also seems less real."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so there's a little bit of a buffer or something that the information is going through to feel perhaps a little more remote from the world."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And perhaps from time to time kind of checking in, can I actually connect with some piece of that reality by reflecting and just reflecting in a way the impact that this has on us and our loved ones, you know, the uncertainty that is true not only for everyone out there, but also for us, everyone in our families and our friends, that the vulnerability that is true and always has been true, is very much exposed as true, as something that's very hard to deny right now, that if you can connect for a few moments around, yes, this situation has an effect on me, on my loved ones."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so that's, it's useful sometimes to notice another investigation in the sense of self can be exploring the way our mind does that othering."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And you can raise your hand, or you could type into the chat box at this point."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "So, yeah, with this reflection on self and the rest of the world feeling not real in a way that feels, as this question says, not so wholesome, you know, it's possible that this is more, as I said, the habit of the separation of self and other is very habitual and common, and may go by unnoticed as we're going through our lives in our ordinary way."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "It's nice to be back with the Sunday morning online community."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "I just came back from Japan, which is more of a family trip, and we were very fortunate to be able to be there for about five weeks."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "So, visiting Rinsoen, one of the things we did with Hoitsu Suzuki Roshi, who is the son of Shunru Suzuki, is we did some chatting for Mel and kind of a little memorial service, and it was very sweet."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And so there's a whole lifestyle that is helping us to let go of our preferences and just enter the moment and just take what's given, receive what's given."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "But then I think that maybe there's a little bit of a, I don't know if it's a deeper meaning or another meaning of this to be, to be one who is without preferences."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And maybe this gets illuminated if we change the word preferences to thinking."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "We didn't have any thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "But it's more like I'm willing to take this moment, this practice, this life as a whole thing, as a whole package."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And we can just accept what's happening and find how, how can I relate to this? How can I be with this? So it's like this dance."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "It doesn't mean that we don't have any preferences, but it means that our preferences are, are not a problem, that we're not captive to our preferences."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he is with important people."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he is with unimportant people."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he teaches open-handed, patient, kind."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he is with Hoitsu."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he is with breath."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "I don't know if there might be a few questions, but you're welcome to type in something in the chat, and it will make its way to me."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "I did want to share something about, you might have heard this teaching in Buddhism, about self-power and other power."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And that's, you know, I think important, an important side of practice."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And so where do you fall on this spectrum of self-power and other power? I mean, maybe we could say that a balanced practice, you know, has elements of both of these."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And then maybe there's, we need to be able to let go and trust and let, let things unfold and not try to control and figure everything out."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "Because I know Thich Nhat Hanh in the 70s and 80s came to Zen Center and came to Taosahara and I think was, was kind of a consultant or a mediator when Zen Center had various difficulties and scandals."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And so I'm sure, I'm sure Mel interacted with him and I know he had great respect for Thich Nhat Hanh."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "You know, we don't have any other point, place, vantage point to rest."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "You know, what am I gonna do? Do I let it go? Do I label it as a thinking? Do I act on it? Do I not act on it? So to see a thought as a thought, to see thinking as thinking, right there creates a place of choice, a place of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "It's a great, great gift of practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Letting the exhale be longer than the inhale can help settle the body, the mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "That's holding your tired heart and mind."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "But we offer, we offer our kindness, our goodness, our compassion, as a training, as service."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "You can also type your reflections in chat, if they are typed to everyone, I'll read your name, and if they're privately sent to me, I won't read your name."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "And also, knowing that the practice tonight was very calm, there's a lot of emphasis on calming, soothing, and the energy body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "And it was really on my heart, because the article really portrayed them in balance as people who kind of celebrated craft, which is filling, and also people who are very brave and very much defending homeland."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "So just holding spaciousness is all dear, dear humanity, which I am a part of, oh, holding all of us with compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "So the more we reflect upon kindness, care, compassion for others, that becomes the inclination of our mind and our actions too."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "It doesn't have to be like this, of course."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "And concentration can be a very useful way to relax, to release tension, to cultivate calmness and ease."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "But if the breath's not working for you, if it isn't like at least a neutral object, then please pick something else, maybe the body, where the body contacts the surface, like the feet, the buttocks, the hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "And then settle into the meditation posture and now guide for a first little bit and then we'll sit in silence."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "Even if we are going through something difficult in our meditation, still our intention generates this wholesomeness."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "But they seem to be subsidiary events."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now, however you interpret rebirth, I don't really want to get into that one at this stage, but he is making it very explicit that the path of metta is the path to awakening."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "This is what is important."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Watering it, manuring it, weeding it, making sure that it's fit for something to grow in."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And so we're talking actually with meta, not of loving kindness, but of boundless and expansive friendliness towards all things."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "It's almost an impossible task as well."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now I use the word heart and mind as a translation for this word which some of you will know, chitta."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "The tradition also talks about panya vimutti, liberation through wisdom or the release through wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And so actually citta vimutti gets downgraded to only giving you release into very high deva realms or brahma realms here."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now out of this confusing morass, I hope to kind of give you a little bit of a story about this all."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "But first of all I want you just to take on board the fundamental nature of kindness, the fundamental nature of friendliness towards all things."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "When he walks into a room everything changes."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "They'd put his little throne there and a place for his translator and everything."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I find often that there is a virtue main of the opposite in the Western world."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Another instance of this is that when we are engaged in practice, I personally feel that there is no such thing as pure Vipassana practice."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now I particularly, in particular when I'm teaching Vipassana retreats, I emphasise always the quality of friendliness that we bring to this dimension of beginning to see what we encounter."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "So, better to acknowledge, better to befriend what is there, rather than to suppress what we see."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "So for example, if we meditate on it, it might be a nice idea."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I'm not quite sure what it means, actually, sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And so, he then accords this notion of real liberation to panya vimutti, that we can only be liberated through penetrating wisdom, penetrating understanding, or deep insight."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Sometimes you have to do things."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "So I think it's a very powerful expression."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "It's also a disillusion between thinking and feeling."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I could follow the arguments, but it hadn't touched me."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And I would also say that about most of the teachings."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "When that distinction, that splitting between self and other, starts to be eroded."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "So it's a very powerful sense."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "The word Karuna, again, I don't know how much you know about the languages of early Buddhism, but the word Karuna comes from a root which has two meanings, and this is the root which just pronounced Kri."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "The word Kriya, which means to do something, to be engaged in an activity."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "It's interesting even in the mythology of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And then comes along a figure called Brahma Sahampati."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now, I think this is a lovely metaphor for, in some sense, the generation of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I really feel like to pause here."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Because I can just go on and see kind of what issues are arising people out of what I've said so far."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Well, in a literal aspect of it, you can't send meta."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "This is actually what it's about."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I mean, as I said earlier on, that word doesn't work for everybody, but I think most of you will understand what I mean by that."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "This is the snapshot of me at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And so we acknowledge, we go through a constant series of acknowledgments."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I think that's really what it's about."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Why should I be thinking these horrible thoughts yet again? There's all that kind of self-critique stuff that comes in, and it's really starting to move away from that by just saying, hello, you're here again."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "They are off doing their own thing, they're playing."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "So the whole process is one of kindness, not one of brutalizing the mind again."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "And so there's this kind of quest for perfection all the time."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "We're constantly having to deal with our imperfections."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "The opposite friendliness is kind of aversion and aggression and all the rest of it."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "It looks very much like, and this is the whole point of the near enemies, is the near enemies look like the very thing that you're supposed to be cultivating."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "It's much more pragmatic, the whole relationship of it."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "I have the microphone, so I guess I get to be the next one."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "Now, I don't know how it is with everybody within the room, obviously, but when I began to look at this and started to critique in a way the translation of matter as loving kindness, love is a very difficult thing to feel love for everybody in this way."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 1)", "completion": "But I think it's also trying to get us away from the sentimentality side of it."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And it's like, you know, that's a little game going to be too much."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "There could be some idea that we're suffering and it's rather embarrassing to have this particular suffering."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And we have an identity that's formed around the suffering or we use it to represent ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And so, that's, you know, adding more weight on top of the suffering."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "It's maybe painful to feel and experience."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "The more likely we're going to react from places of maybe habitual neurosis or habitual unhealthy or unskillful ways that we might kind of respond."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "The reactions kind of come from the mind."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "But if I can somehow step out of the story and just allow myself to feel it physically, it's bad enough, but that makes space for it."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And was that way for many days? Nothing changed."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "More than had been common for me in recent times."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And I felt very tender and soft."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "Maybe this suffering and sadness I felt, maybe it was like a meat tenderizer."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And I just felt that they were distancing themselves from it and kind of shutting off from it."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "It must have been a good reason because evolution usually doesn't do too many things, casually or, you know, without a purpose or some value."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "And so just a natural function is just a nature."}
{"prompt": "Love and the Weight of Suffering", "completion": "In what ways, there might be ways in which what I said doesn't work, but in what ways does it work for you? In what ways, if you study yourself, is this actually a case that you can see how you pile on weight and make it heavy? And what ways do you kind of lighten it and make it light? There it is."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "It might be a little bit loud today, the volume."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "I don't remember how much I had, but I don't even remember how much a statue cost, but it was probably like a lot of money."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And so that was a decision."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "The teacher that I practiced with there named Pandita, he has a book titled something like a mind called beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "But it turns out that in the ancient teachings of the Buddha, he uses the word beauty and beautiful quite frequently."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And translators will translate good karma and bad karma as good karma and bad karma."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "The Dharma is beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, beautiful at the end."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "What's the beautiful thing to do? What's the beautiful thing to do as you go about your daily life? What if what you do is supposed to, what if you do your actions, what you do in the world is beautiful? How about if you drive beautifully? I wonder what I would look like if everyone was driving beautifully."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And the floor is this kind of wooden old floor."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "It's kind of a beautiful place."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And I got to watch her make tea."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "There's the category of those things which are unskillful to do or unwholesome to do."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "But when mindfulness is strong and stable and we're studied in this very clear, strong, present moment awareness, mindfulness is not just a good idea."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "Mindfulness becomes a state, a state of clear awareness that when it's established would be similar to there being no smog or haze in the Bay Area air."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "Like a tranquil mind, you can understand how it can be beautiful when you compare it to the opposite, which is an agitated mind."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "One of the higher quality minds that we can experience is in fact a mind that's very, very tranquil."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "So it's not, you know, it's not out of balance."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "Then, you know, these things feel and there's not ideas."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And you get a very different feeling when you get this association with making sacred and concentrating and polishing."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "You know, you're focusing on yourself and self-involved."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And I think that the idea that meditation is selfish may became because Buddhism was considered a religion and religion is supposed to be altruistic."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "But that didn't occur to them that that was selfish."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "When you think things, what would be that beautiful thing to think? When you engage in meditation practice and make an effort to be mindful, not what's the right way to make effort, what's the beautiful way to make effort? The quality of the way you pay attention is a way of doing that beautifully like you're doing a Japanese tea ceremony in your mind."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "You know, that doesn't make sense, right? So, you know, oh, I have to do this Buddhist thing, I have to follow the Buddhist way of life, I'm not doing it right, I'm supposed to be mindful, that's what Buddhism teaches, I have to be mindful so that I can be free of suffering and I'm not doing it right, it's terrible."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "You know, it's just illogical."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "So, I'll tell you what the right way is."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "No, I think it's personal."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And also, it's very easy to slip off into a judgmental aspect of what is right and ethical."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "But the word beautiful, have much more softness and roundness to it and an expansiveness to it."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "That kind of egotism is probably not so useful."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "And if all things are equal, then also look at the consequences for yourself, which makes you a better person, which helps you grow and develop and become a more freer person, a kinder person, a happier person."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "If you don't mind bringing the mic all the way."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Beautiful", "completion": "There's a kind of a respect for the other person, a valuing other person when you give something really consciously and carefully and fully, as opposed to just kind of throw the business card at them."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Review of Retreat Instructions", "completion": "And then he'd run off in this direction, that direction, sometimes up on the play structure, sometimes on the swing, sometimes the sandbox."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Review of Retreat Instructions", "completion": "I don't know what trees you have in New Zealand, but here in California, we had these redwood trees that are strong, big, wide, tall, straight, regal."}

{"prompt": "Instructions: Review of Retreat Instructions", "completion": "Gaze upon the mind that's thinking."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Review of Retreat Instructions", "completion": "Not so much the content of your thoughts, but the process and activity of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Review of Retreat Instructions", "completion": "Just seeing without any efforts to try to make something happen, make something go away."}
