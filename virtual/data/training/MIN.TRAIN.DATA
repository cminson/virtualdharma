{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "These identities, the collective identities very much are not our own doing, you know, they are cultural doings in a way, but they're not they're not just one individual creating it, creating these collective identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "Now the Buddha definitely talked about this."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Collective Identities", "completion": "And so, you know, it supported me in being able to navigate some of the really like wildly unhelpful mind states that the mind was in."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "Breathing out, know that you're breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "For example, whatever is obvious in that in-breath and out-breath, you can receive the in-breath and out-breath rather than having the mind dive into or look at or try to search out the in-breath and the out-breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Simple Knowing", "completion": "So this is an in-breath and this is an out-breath."}

{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "I'm planning to, in our plan for this retreat, we decided to have the conversation around suitability be the last night's talk, essentially, looking at how we can bring clear comprehension into our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We start to see that experience is impermanent, unreliable, and not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The nature of our experience, the nature of the way our human system processes experience, we could say perhaps, there's a lot of information coming in, and in some ways, in order to navigate all of that information coming in, our mind simplifies."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But our human system is designed to smooth that out."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "This is just one way that the perceptual system kind of reinforces this notion of stability."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The screen about 10 feet high, and maybe 40 feet long, and across that screen was driving a school bus."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that's a way in which we inform ourselves of this delusion."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So we try to create our lives."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We know experience through the concepts rather than through the direct experience."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What we want is a concept."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Again, this is an exploration for you."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It can be interesting to look at, well, what is the happiness? What is the idea of the happiness that thinks it's going to come? What is the wanting about? What is actually being wanted? Mostly, we want a concept, not the actual thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "We look at, we don't try to come up with some bypassing of a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "What is that? What am I taking to be self? How stable is it? This can be very interesting."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It can happen really quickly, this shift, and again, being aware in the moment what we are taking to be self, we start to see that there's not a lot of stability in what we're taking to be self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's like, why didn't I impute the permanence to the happiness instead of the miserableness? It's like, I don't know which, you know, whether one arose more or not, but, you know, it's kind of like the mind, for some reason, latched onto the miserableness and imputed a sense of kind of stability to that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so this kind of investigation of what are you taking to be self? And again, perhaps a sense of is it always there, especially for senses of self that are, once that we frequently identify with or think that's me, really useful to notice when it's not there."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so, there's kind of like a pattern-matching that happens."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "That's kind of like a pattern-matching thing."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But if at the level, at the next level, there's a kind of a thought that we perhaps, you know, see that, we perceive that thing, and then we kind of go the next level and start thinking."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You know, it's like, oh, that's a snake."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It's just beginning to get to the point of believing it's a snake, but it starts thinking about it in this way."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "The third level of distortion is the level of view, where we actually start to believe that the perception, the thought is what it is, and it's going to be hard to convince us otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You get this belief there was a snake, and somebody else says, you know, I walked on that."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "He said, you know, mental formations are not self."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So I was meditating in Burma."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And so that, I knew that was a view."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "And, you know, I thought there was compassion in the heart for the pig that was being slaughtered."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So I, I'm just walking up and down the driveway in the middle of the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It was kind of, it was like, there were a lot of them, but they never hit me."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "But what was kind of amazing to me was that while I knew, it was kind of amazing, I knew that there was, that it was a view that, that I did not know that pigs were being slaughtered on the other side of the wall."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So that perception of the squeal, the squeal coming into being perceived as a pig, shifted from being the, you know, just thinking about it as a pig into an actual view that it was a pig."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "So sometimes we can use wisdom reflections, thoughts in the mind that can help the mind to be able to hold and be curious about these ways that we're suffering."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "It knows it's seeing through this delusional filter."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "Like it can go in and perhaps there'll be a moment in the meditation where the conditions are such that, like the plant taking up the moisture that seeps down, the mind sees something in a different way because it's heard this information."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing Delusion", "completion": "You don't have to figure anything out."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And in a way, developing an awareness of the felt sense of a liking and wanting and feeling how they contrast with each other and similarly disliking and hating."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I like it, but I don't have to get it or have it or own it or be looking towards anything at all."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to become compassionate."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "I want to get rid of my afflictive emotions."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And so even those, those are wholesome aspirations because they get co-opted by self view."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But if you look at the, like in the eightfold path, the element of right effort, Samavayamo, it that really encapsulates the best way to direct our actions, so that the right effort is divided into four aspects."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So restraining the unwholesome from arising as Sangvara or if the unwholesome has arisen, then letting it go."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "There's, there's choices being made."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "There's discernment, choices being made."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But the, the difference between that and Bhavatana, Navi Bhavatana, the desire to become and the desire to get rid of is there's no self element."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's, it's, it's balanced, it's integrated."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "But that's based on mindfulness and wisdom as an action based on mindfulness and wisdom rather than me."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "They look just like each other, but they're also opposites."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "It's, it's just another pattern of consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "Well, there isn't really a concept of soul in Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So he says, you know, is the body changing? Is it permanent or impermanent? It's impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That's what, and then at that moment, that knowing quality has been forgotten."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And the attention is latched onto the thought."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "That's all you get really."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "And because the practice is for you, it's not like that we're just subservient."}
{"prompt": "Q and A: Is There a Soul? Who is the Knower? Can I Open my Eyes? Do I Have to Focus on the Breath?", "completion": "So those who wish to sit can consider on, but if you'd like to go and do some walking meditation for 15 minutes, then please do so."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the direction is towards liberation, towards freedom."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's a reverence for a life, there's a tremendous generosity in not taking but giving, and there's a deep respect for people and their sexual well-being and all that that entails."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "What kind of relationship are we living there? And then right effort could be seen as a relationship."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to have a mind, mental activity that avoids what is unhealthy mental actions and mental activities and do those things which are healthy."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "It's probably one of the most beautiful ways to relate to yourself, to set up this kind of inner life."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And when they were young, I became clear at some point, the way I hadn't known before, that because I think because my, my wife, maybe if I speak myself specially, I'd done, I'd done a lot of letting go, letting go and study of compassion and caring."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And unless we took care of the family unit, we were going to create a skewed relationship in the family."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I mean, like I said in my family, I could see if we weren't careful at some point, that's what we were creating in our son."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so that's some people's default."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But that also makes it kind of fun."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "I think it's possible I haven't really tried surfing more than once."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So I don't know what I'm talking about maybe."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Self preoccupation, self-consciousness drops away."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's not just the wave, but it's everything that's involved, including you."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And it's the combination of all the relatedness, all those things coming together that allows us to do the perfect ride."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "So for you living your life, what's the perfect life? What's the perfect way to do things? What's the perfect way to be in a conversation with someone? What's the perfect way of caring for someone? What's the perfect way of doing anything? If you carry an external standard of what that is, I'm supposed to be like someone else, that's the way they do it."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "The perfect way to be, or in the language of Samma, the complete way to be, the whole way of being in relationship to this situation, has to do with your contributions and who you are and all kinds of things about you as much as it has to do with the situation."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "Imagine, just get to be yourself."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And free it from this idea of being the self that we have to prove or defend or do anything with."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And the idea that things can flow within us without it being appropriated by self, made into self, measured by self, is a fascinating and delightful and empowering kind of situation to be in."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And so to begin exploring this world of self, the self thing we do, the attachment to it, not in any blame, not in, now you're a bad Buddhist, you don't become a bad Buddhist by anything that you do and how you are."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But it's helpful to know that this is what we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "If you get involved in too much retrospective thinking about what I did, you probably fall off the wave."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "As soon as you say that, you're kind of locked on to something, and this is how it has to be."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "But maybe it's the right thing in the combination, the relatedness of you and everything else."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "There's not you, and there's me, and there's what happens between us."}
{"prompt": "Right Relationship", "completion": "And maybe you'll understand some point very personally."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It gives us a different opportunity."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So to do this, I'd like to begin with something that maybe is trying to be a poem."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Rather than if you're not the emission thoughts in the world of the web of it all, but if you're able to step back enough and have enough stillness or calm or mindfulness of the mind to watch thoughts appear when they appear effortlessly, when thoughts occur and they come unbidden, there was no planning of them, there was no design for them to appear, it wasn't like you just set yourself up to think about something."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And I'd better figure out how to make more money, and maybe I should get a new job."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And what was I doing? That was like a whole trip I took."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I once took a trip like that, and it wasn't continuous, but I think it was probably about seven months."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So the people who make, when they have a guest season, the people who are going to cook for the guests."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so I spent the winter, every time there was a meal, thinking about the recipe and thinking about menus and thinking about what I was going to do and planning ahead."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I thought, what was I doing all those months? What a waste of time."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I was the person who was ringing all these bells during the chanting that they do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "So I was supposed to ring the bells for this ceremony."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Or I would have picked up the change and just kind of just done it without in an effortless way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You remember things and can figure out what to do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "I was putting the dishes in the dishwasher machine this evening."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Very simple, innocent thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "They helped me line up the plates and stuff in a more efficient way."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And a major player in all those concerns is me, myself and my mind."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Or maybe it takes a lot of effort."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "You try to stay on the breath."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And so you can feel that tug that's there, the stickiness that's there."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Because we're still in the maze if we're thinking."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "In the path of mindfulness, we're learning to look at that directly and learn to relax."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And they don't feel like thin, weak little threads."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "Isn't that nice? And that has to, if you're able to discover how to see thoughts arise effortlessly and not get involved."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And then trust, really trust that mind that was able to watch the thoughts arise effortlessly."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's not very promising or it doesn't seem very, it might seem out of scale with the tremendous importance of these webs of thoughts that we have to think and the important things our life have to do."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "It's just very, it's very humble."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "And perhaps the self that the Buddhism is talking about unwinding, dissolving, is just a complicated web, spider web, that we've spun for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Web of Thoughts", "completion": "But it was a quieter voice maybe, or a quieter projector or something, and it just came and was there."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "It's a biography of the nun, Tenzin Palmo, called Cave in the Snow."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Some of you, I'm sure have read it."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "She spent 12 years living in a cave high up in the Himalayas."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "That's, that was an inspiring level of equanimity for me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And we're all familiar with physical pain, gain and loss, getting what we want and being deprived of what we want."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "If boss might say one day you did a great job and then you feel great and then another time criticizing you and you feel bad."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "No person can be found who has been, is or will be only criticized or only praised."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "You know, unfaithful in this repute, I'll share a little story that happened to me."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "I was on a long residential retreat."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Everyone was seeing how unmindful I was."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So we figured that would get him there on time."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And he picked it up and just delightedly started reading it oblivious to his waiting friends."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "And I love that definition."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "The body at the center, this is an embodied practice."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "On the last day of retreat, to facilitate the ending of the retreat, the managers decided to change the lunch schedule."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They decided there'd be two groups and they'd split them by the alphabet."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "They posted the day schedule."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "My husband, with all the wisdom of a yogi after a three-month retreat, took a pen and added H through L equanimity practice."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "Two simple happenings that got entangled."}
{"prompt": "7 Factors of Awakening: Equanimity", "completion": "So let's share a couple of minutes of silence."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So my deep commitment to mindfulness was really challenged this evening on the way here."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So my offering, whatever you would offer to me, is going back to the center this evening."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I was thinking a lot about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And all of the retreat people, the people who'd been studying for many, many years, done a lot of Dharma practice, done substantial retreat, had cleaned the center and prepared and organized and got the word out."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And in the Tibetan tradition, which is a, I call it the Rokoko of Buddhism, we have everything you would ever want in Tibetan Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And he said, well, let's just start slowly."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "He says, OK, don't be discouraged."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And this takes years and years of practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Don't worry if you can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But the real practice starts in just little tiny steps."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it's very interesting because I've thought about him many, many years and I didn't know this teacher's name."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so that was one of the first stories that I thought of that really, really impressed me because it also gave a lot of permission that some days it's just not coming together in meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I thought, you know, it's just like exercise."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when you do a mindfulness practice on your meditation seat, that's the foundation that you begin to create so that when you get off your meditation seat and you begin to walk out and engage with the world, with your friends and family and coworkers and community, that you can take some of that awareness with you in your interactions."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But you want to be present, you want to be yourself, and you want to be aware, how am I feeling in this moment? Am I aware of my breath? Am I aware of this person opposite me? What is really being triggered? Am I fully listening if I'm being triggered? Can I put that aside? Can I be fully present again? And so you have the opportunity to, each time you drift away, to then bring yourself back in the interaction."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You don't need to have mindfulness down like that in one lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So we go to 9 o'clock, right? One of the things that I wanted to do this evening was to do a guided practice on working with emotions, emotional states, and mindfulness for you to have the experience of what it's like outside in the world every day, but to begin to incorporate mindfulness in your daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And so what it is is that as you go into meditation, I'm going to guide you into different states, and then I will bring you back to this moment now with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And I want you to fully experience that in your body at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How will I do it differently next time? What choice will I make if this ever happens again? And ask the question and just breathe in and out slowly and gently and wait and watch and notice what comes up."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "It's work that takes us into the core of who we are to show up differently in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "But if I can come back to this breath and this moment, I might have the opportunity to make a different choice in the situation."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to go numb and we don't want to indulge them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "We don't want to get so taken off track that we create train wrecks wherever we go in our emotional or relational lives."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And when we focus our mind on this present moment now, we're remembering that what has already occurred is over and done with and there's nothing we can do about it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How can we overcome them? A dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and this is narrated by Daniel Goleman."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then one more called Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "I certainly don't have one of those other moments where I'm really not mindful."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Practice unfolds, especially it changes over the years."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, there's the day."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You want to just bring it back very, very gently."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "So I practice on your cushion at home for a while."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And then periodically at work to just, just to track."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "The breath is such a wonderful, integrative, neutral place to come fully back into our body and to not only be present, but it softens everything a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You might have already answered it, but my question was about when are you, like when thinking of an incident or a type of incident, my inclination is to avoid or remove myself from it."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "And it seems like that is resisting it instead of just noticing."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "How can I be mindfulness in this moment of irritation? Focus on the breath and recognizing there's just this fine line between, ooh, that I could really stay with irritation until the light changes really easily, very, very easily."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Or I could shift it a little bit and give myself a little breathing room."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Okay, really, really, really irritated."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "Because the irritation is really, really just in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "You know, if you try to think of some other ones, I'm sure somebody has one on them."}
{"prompt": "Mind Training and Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "completion": "This is one of my favorites."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Let me explore how concentration, right concentration on the Eightfold Path, supports the development of wisdom, of understanding, not just any kind of wisdom, but the understanding about the nature of experience as impermanent, unreliable as a source of lasting happiness."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "There's nothing worth clinging to because that clinging creates suffering, creates stress, creates struggle, unease, unhappiness, and actually lack of safety."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not like we practice one and then put it down and then the next one comes in."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It often feels like a little bit of a shift in the mind, a little bit of an aha, a little bit of oh, yeah, I see."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's just a little taste, a little sense of, oh, there's more here to see."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And recognizing the experience of wisdom, recognizing when that's happening, is another supportive condition for the development of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so these two, the habits that get us caught and the misunderstanding about these truths are intimately connected."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Because our system really understands or kind of resonates with those wholesome qualities, as wholesome, as onward leading, as very different from the way that we tend to get caught by things."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "He often talked about our mental formations as things that have jobs, that greed has its job of holding onto things."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Kind of like, you know, sometimes I use an analogy of a car with difficult emotions, difficult experiences."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so this kind of a shift of, oh, this is just what's happening in the present moment, may have that kind of quality."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "They're no longer, they're no longer locked together."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so I could see, and what I'm describing here took place in a matter of a couple seconds."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Oh, it's just that arising, but seeing that the momentum of it continues."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Sometimes this can be the strength of concentration, but sometimes it's the strength of wisdom that allows the mind to just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "So that's an example of how we can misunderstand."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "The mind really understands the absence of greed, aversion and delusion there as being a different way to live in this world."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "Actually, the definition of freedom, one of the most easily accessible definitions of freedom, of enlightenment, is the absence of greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Growth of Wisdom on the Eightfold Path", "completion": "And so the taste of the reduction of greed, aversion and delusion, the taste in moments of a mind that has let go of greed, aversion and delusion, these are pointers in the direction of freedom, freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "My name is Maria Stratman."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I'm this person to recognize not so much how we've changed, but that this is the person showing up for these conditions."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Being aware of what our intentions are, occasionally asking ourselves, what are my intentions here? What is it that I'm doing? Why am I doing this? What is it that's showing up here in this moment? And keeping in mind how it is that we want to be in the moment, not who we want to be, who we want to be."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "You know, I've always had as the overriding intention in my life to be open-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It doesn't say anything about becoming open-hearted."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That condition is the next moment."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "That's the next set of conditions I have to worry about."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "It's not very large, has lots of koi in it, and a couple of ducks, sometimes geese, sometimes an egret feeding on the fish."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Dreams about helplessness."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "I don't know if you've, it's hard to talk about an attitude of mind like this, but has to do with a sense of space."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "So being aware of the attitude that my mind, the mind state tells me something about this person in these conditions, who's trying to live life, doesn't tell me what to do."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This is, this is the agitation that is here."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And now that was really his talk at the, the mind state and, and the, the learning what the mind state is, how it feels is a practice."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "This, this is, this is the condition."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Part of the condition is the energy that I bring into the moment, whether that energy is low energy or high energy, whether I'm feeling compressed or spacious."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Why am I confused? Let me get it all organized."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "How do we free ourselves of that? How do we find a place of safety without spending all our lives trying to be safe and not letting anything happen and trying to control the outcome of what happens? We look to what our experience has taught us."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Anger is present, but I'm not angry."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Once we see it, we can disentangle ourselves from it."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "But if I can say, okay, it's here, and my intention for kindness is here, and they are struggling with one another."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "Whenever I hear stories about refugees, what comes to mind is a hangover from when I was in grade school."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "These were the most exotic people I'd ever seen."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And they'd look around with suspicion."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "And to embrace that change in the sense of just allowing it to be true."}
{"prompt": "The Heroism of Being Changed", "completion": "All we have is time, is now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And maybe being curious about whether there's relaxation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "The relaxation of body really helps our mind to be able to land in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing the neck, the shoulders, the arms, the hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "There is happening here in your experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "This receptive side of the practice can be so supportive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then receiving that, receiving a breath, receiving body sensations or receiving sound."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "So visando la musculatura de la espalda."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Observamos si el abdomen se expande."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Si hay pensamientos, los ofrecemos una nota mental."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "No es necesario juzgar, permitimos nuestra experiencia tal cual es."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ahora, observemos si entra más aire de un lado o otro de nuestras fuerzas nasales."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Ese es nuestro punto de vigilancia."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Sintamos el contacto de nuestras caderas sobre el cojín o sobre la silla."}
{"prompt": "Meditación Guiada", "completion": "Pongamos nuestra tensión de nuevo a la inhalación y la exhalación."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "Maybe the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxed and Aware", "completion": "It's just receiving what's obvious in the field of bodily experience."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This afternoon, I thought of continuing the reflection on conditionality, primarily from the perspective of the teaching of dependent co-arising, paticha samukhada, dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this arises, that arises, and to me, this expresses kind of two different aspects of conditionality."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "When this arises, that arises, to me, can be more the conditions shaping the future, or in the sense of conditions leading in a direction."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So dependent origination in one form expresses that how suffering comes to be, it's a very detailed description in one form, it's twelve links that describe how suffering comes to be, and that's the more familiar, to most of us, the more familiar formulation, there's another one that uses ten links, that it's a kind of a description of what goes on in our system, in our human system, it answers the question essentially that so many people have, it's like, why, why does this happen, you know, why, why does this go on? And he describes, the Buddha describes just this kind of unfolding chain, the tumbling on that when not seen, it just tends to keep tumbling on in that direction, conditioning more suffering, conditioning more sense of selfing."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Suffering is both a supportive condition for more suffering, and suffering is a supportive condition for freedom, when it is met with wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The six sense spaces follow or arise with contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming, birth, aging in death."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "As the Buddha often says at that point, when he says aging in death, he says, and there you have the entire mass of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And if that search is met with a teaching that describes a different way, that can lead to faith."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I think of that as the, you know, when this is, that is kind of arising."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "This to me is like when this arises, that tends to arise."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So, that craving, you know, that's a very habitual response based on that feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "With craving arises the desire to have or get rid of the actual, I mean, the actual doing of the having or the getting rid of, that's the clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so that that greed and that sense of aversion to the failure and all of that."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so these mental formations conditioned by ignorance, there's a lot of different ways that we, that these come into, into being and, you know, the, the foundational ones I've just mentioned around greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "It's not, I'm not suggesting that we, you know, try to train babies not to cry so moms don't come."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so there's all kinds of conditions that come that shape us and our responses to the world."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And then some of them are also shaped by, you know, how our families are and what culture we grew up in, no culture in a way could be seen as shared beliefs, shared mental formations, shared views."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And so those things just become true or normal."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So for example, mental formations around the idea of race, views, beliefs, ideas connected to that idea."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And a lot of suffering comes from those kind of, you could call them collective mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So we absorb all of these from the time that we're very young."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "The mental formations of others, one chain of dependent origination right here, the mental formations of others being transmitted to us, us picking up those mental formations in our chain following on and our own, our own mental formations have an effect, not only in our own mind, but also affect others."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "And this is my image that these this currents of the stream of mental formations that we're all swimming in, it's really hard to see this current, this direction, that there's another, there's another way because everything, all of the mental formations that we're exposed to or most of the mental formations we're exposed to until we come into the Dharma is this direction of mental formations based on greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So mental formation constructs form constructs feeling constructs perception in line with its intentions."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "I mean, we all know that experience of when somebody is angry and we're there in the room with them, it tends to, you know, make us feel angry or defensive or, you know, lash out sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "Not necessarily if there is mindfulness available, not necessarily, but often habitually anger internally conditions, creates conditions for anger to arise in others."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "What else is here? What am I missing? And then, so that consciousness, what we are conscious of, so what we are, what we become aware of is already filtered based on ignorance, based on our mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So fortunately, it is possible to change the conditions of this cycle with mindfulness and wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Conditionality: Dependent Co-arising", "completion": "So it's not hopeless by any means, but it does take the courage, I think it takes a lot of courage to watch these processes unfolding both internally and externally, and not respond habitually, but respond instead from this perspective of mindfulness and wisdom that brings in the relational brahma-vaharas, brings in love and compassion."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And it's something that we explore in our self over time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "That's a particular again that's a particular attitude about practice."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And so if we're subtly applying these ideas to them, we are again in a very subtle way controlling it."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So the beginning of the verse from Sikula, remember it goes like this, if there is something in these teachings calling out to you, it's because there's something in you calling out to these teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And then equally so, can you hear something calling out to you? Is there something in these teachings that is calling out to you? So what is this resonance between the teachings and your heart? Is there some sense of resonance there? In the recent IRC retreat, Paul Haller was talking about the invitation of the far shore."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "And that can help, in a way, take us deeper into ourselves, deeper into this moment, whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "We need to listen in order to hear that."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So it's maybe different at the beginning, and then farther along, and then even farther along, there's a way in which how we're relating to the teachings is coming forth differently in our heart."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "So, let me read this verse one more time."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I hope very much that you find this resonance as often as possible."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma Life", "completion": "I see a question about the book that I read from."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And the mind is not relaxed, caught up in mental tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And what is here, what is obvious may change from moment to moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Perhaps the breath or body sensations or hearing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "As opposed to taking it personally, thinking it's something wrong with me, or wrong with what I'm doing, wrong with the meditation, it's just another arising."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Almost as if the experience of our body and mind is a river just flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "You're just in that river flowing through."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "For some of you, it may support your capacity to be present, to perhaps narrow the field a little bit of what you're receiving, choosing perhaps the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation Supports Mindfulness", "completion": "Sometimes, in that moment when mindfulness returns, we're not judging the mind, not judging ourselves for the mind having been wandering."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What I would like to talk about this morning is anxiety in the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's a really significantly large number."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is just my thoughts as they're coming along."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There's an I can't feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "When things are very uncertain, we can't plan our way into them."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What is that kind of funneling in feeling that happens? Sometimes it's a matter of feeling that there are just too many things happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Sometimes it has to do with an attachment to outcome."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And the sense of not being able to control the outcome is experienced that way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's just a total stopping."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I've seen that in some people close to me recently, so it's really strong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I was surprised at how much effort it took just to sort of walk down the street."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There also seems to be a little piece of loneliness and anxiety where we kind of lose our sense that somebody else is there to help us."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So this is one of Dan's things."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Which kind of brings me to the place where we start talking about how can we work with anxiety? How do we experience all of these aspects of anxiety? And what does that mean as we try to eliminate suffering in our lives or lessen or ease or make it a little less with us? How do we practice with anxiety? So what I would like to suggest is that being with the experience of anxiety, all of these various ways that anxiety manifests itself, has to do with the practice of being with what is true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What causes contraction or defensive postures? What's there? The willingness to stay with what is there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But I woke up, it's pouring rain, I'm thinking, okay, rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So here I am going 20 miles an hour on 280 in pouring rain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Well, if I'd taken another route, or maybe I should have, or maybe I could scoot over to that lane."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But the conditions are not going to change."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I'll either be on time or I won't be on time."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It isn't gritting your teeth and stuffing yourself through the experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But there was one time, there was one place that we went in on this vacation where the water was rough."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And I realized, and then there was a slight current."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "There is easing around the tightness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes, so I may find myself in a conversation with someone where it's not going well."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then I have to figure out what I'm going to do because ill will is there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "This is going to happen in the future."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "But just saying the current experience right here in this room, that's different."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What this person from Germany told me is that he found a softening, an easing around the discomfort of the restlessness."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "In the example of a blooming argument or unskillful conversation, I've learned that I can just stop."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You have to tell somebody, well, this isn't going anywhere for me."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And usually the conversation, which tends to be one-sided at that point, keeps going."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Because I've stopped, I'm not putting more energy into the discussion."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It surprises me what happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So that we think that every time we deviate from peacefulness that it's a failure."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "And then we have a blossoming into this place of self-judgment and anxiety that we're kind of hooked in."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Mentally, I touch the ground."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So sometimes, for example, I may feel discomfort of, let's say I have a feeling of discomfort due to feeling inadequate."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "What am I feeding? What's really happening here? What's going on? Sometimes it's very often a response to anxiety feeding."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Fortunately, I try not to keep ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You've probably heard this poem before, but it seems particularly fitting."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "Goodwill for ourselves, basically."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's really quite lovely and it doesn't seem to matter whether it's pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The equanimity is in the bringing yourself back."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's beautiful because it keeps me wanting to keep meditating without judgment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's what equanimity, a lot of what equanimity seems like."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I think getting towards living at peace with that I'm going to die would be a nice thing to live my life that way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm creating how great this pain is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "It's the manipulation of view."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So I think that's a really important point, that a large part of what your experience is dependent on where you look."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "As I'm sitting here speaking, I'm trying to be reasonable about what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "I'm conscious of my arms moving."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "So it's both a skill and something to be aware of, that what you are experiencing is determined by where you're looking."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "You're coming so long way and have a great subject we talked about here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "That's really helpful here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "The suffering in it can easily overwhelm the mind without a lot of training and a lot of care."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and the Dharma", "completion": "After you've had a heart attack, everything changes."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So this is a practice for daily life."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So just that familiarity of seeing awareness return, it actually happens a lot to us in our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's like the mindfulness begins to get familiar with that moment."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And it does seem to build."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So yeah, I think I'll stop there and see if there's any comments or questions or reflections about this topic."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "It's serving a similar purpose to kind of like noticing when mindfulness returns throughout the day."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "And the person in the question found that noticing mindfulness arising with suffering was easy."}
{"prompt": "Noticing the Return of Awareness in Daily Life", "completion": "So that intention somehow kind of seeds the mind to connect with it, returning more."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes, so the topic, I shouldn't start with meditation, I can't talk after that, I just feel like going on and on."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Okay, so the topic I would like to discuss with you today is this whole thing about how do we balance our own practice with our concern for others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And for that I am basing myself mainly on the simile of the acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then we have a third one, this is in the Moolasavastivada Vinaya."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I just give you time to read."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At the old times there were no computers, no books, no nothing."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "A dana of fearlessness, a dana of non-violence, a dana of harmlessness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And in the Pali version we again get this statement that protecting oneself one protects others, protecting others one protects oneself, which we don't have in the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We do not know if there was any connection between this and the Indian Acrobat, but it just fits the Acrobat Simulim so well that I want you to see it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is from the whole logic, it seems more meaningful, this part, that the teacher says, yes, you're right, we have to protect ourselves, but this is what I all the time had in mind anyway."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It doesn't change the meaning of the acrobat simile itself, but to my personal feeling, it just runs much more smoothly."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "At this point, I want to briefly stop and see if there's any questions or comments on this acrobat simile, because that is what I had in mind on this particular simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Usually, when I go somewhere to give talks, the idea is always like, what can I learn today from you? And so it's very lovely."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But that's the testing ground."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "We have to test it out in everyday practice."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then we see where we really stand."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And I can imagine protecting my body, but then to think of protecting the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That can I protect my mind in a situation like that by saying, oh, well, they're not a good acrobat."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yes? The mic is coming from back."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So it seems, even though it's a symbiotic relationship, they're in very different positions."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "The teacher says this is correct and is also the meaning of what I said."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That is the way how I read the Chinese."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the student is kind of amplifying their understanding of how they need to go about it."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Any more ideas about the pole? It's so lovely when you all say something and slowly the thing becomes richer and richer and richer."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, that's so what she, if I understand her right, what she's drawing our attention to is that this whole interaction is a very clear demonstration of conditionality, dependent arising, the interaction of the two."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's still the responsibility."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They still have to work together."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "That's like being on retreat then, no? Perhaps that's also in their stomach."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Yeah, so then we go with some other similes."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness is the one factor to protect the mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then there's another setting."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It's again the gatekeeper of the town, but there are two messengers and they want to know the way to the king in the town."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So the gatekeeper speaks to me as well."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So that's the choice to react or to sit with something that happens."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "They have slightly different nuances."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But anyway, that was just kind of a literal example that this reminds me of mindfulness and."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "Can anybody explain? Yes, please? Somebody there, I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And for me, it's a very domestic simile."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It sits back and allows things to unfold for us to see and understand."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So when Yana Ponyaka is telling us how by looking after ourselves or in the acrobat simile by keeping our own balance, we are actually looking after the other."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And now we come to the other aspect."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I mean, if I want to give you the dhāna of fearlessness, of non-violation, of harmlessness, I also have to do preparation, I have to clear my own mind."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "But my own understanding from what I can gather from the early discourses and also the early Abhidharma is that probably what was originally meant is myself and others."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "So seeing how others relate to what I do, like now, are you falling asleep? Are you aware? I need to have that awareness for me to keep that talk going on."}

{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "It is an important point with all this interest we have in mindfulness and the emphasis of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "I found myself still thinking of the simile you mentioned this afternoon about the practice being like kneading of the dough, the meditation practice, and the knowledge being like the yeast."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the situation changed when I went to Germany and I decided, now I'm doing it differently."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And now at present, I, practice has become so strong, I can't handle that anymore."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And they go like, what? But it is the fact because as I come out of my practice, the mind is so clear and I know what I want to send."}
{"prompt": "Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others Through Mindfulness", "completion": "And at that time, the question is, what did I do with my life? And that's not the question, did I become a professor or not? How many friends I got and blah blah blah."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "But when they discussed what they benefited from them and what way it was so great, in one way or the other, the people who had been raised in this local culture in the United States, they emphasized that they discovered who they are, they got a sense of real independence and freedom, and all the reference points were very individualistic."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so in many ways, maybe they were having similar, you could say similar experience of settling, getting concentrated, becoming still, letting go of hindrances, but the meaning or the value that they took out of the experience, what they selected out of their experiences, this is what is important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "So we also come with a lot of ideas, not just like that, but what it means to be an individual, what it means to be a self, what's important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (2 of 5) Self and Others", "completion": "And so you need to meditate to get calmer and quieter because that's how you're going to, you know, be more respected at work."}

{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And one is fear and the other is danger."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And so this movement towards becoming fearless in a certain way is part of the movement of Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And one of the functions of Buddhist practice is in fact to overcome the terror, the fear of death."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "Even this idea of clinging to life, holding on to life and not dying, if that's what's happening, that somehow it's not worth it."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And not all fear is the same."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "And we learn that because we see over and over again the damage that comes, the pain that comes, the suffering that comes from certain movements of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "I don't have to continue engaging in that."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So I do have some fear, I don't think they'd reproach me yet, but they would fear them."}
{"prompt": "Practicing With Fear and Danger", "completion": "So a certain kind of fear around my behavior."}

{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "So we talk about them, but the important thing is that each of us recognize them for ourselves, which constitutes liberating insight."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that certainly has its place."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And I'm sure for you as well, for me, sometimes it's very difficult to hold the enormity of the suffering in this world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Understanding that if we can relieve ourselves of suffering, then of course we will relieve the suffering in the world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And so that can be a clinging, a holding on to what we like, wanting to have more of it, or a pushing away, a resisting of what we don't like, not wanting to have it."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "You know, so often people will say, but why? Why did this happen to me? Why did I do? And of course, the Buddhist answer is, why not? Why not me? Not in a blaming way, but just the recognition."}

{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "We all have tendencies that we might not like, but to be free of them might be kind of scary."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "Again, that takes some of the sting out of things that have created suffering in my life, have been the root of my suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "And that led to a lack of self-confidence and that has been something that has dogged me a good bit of my life."}

{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "If we work on developing peace within ourselves, we will radiate that out to the world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Dukkha", "completion": "But it kind of follows me around."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You don't have to try to dive in and find something subtle, but just like contact of the body against the chair or cushion, any physical sense of sitting, just being aware that you're sitting, sitting and breathing, and just exploring, remembering to be with yourself."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Letting Experience Communicate Itself", "completion": "You don't have any say over that it happens, it's natural that it happens, the condition of encouraging it, of being aware of it, of noticing it when it comes in, encourages it, it creates the conditions for it to happen more and more."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "Whatever is here has arisen because of conditions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Kind Attention", "completion": "It's like holding it in a warm embrace or a friendly connection."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "We can really say yes to it and engage and hopefully it's a healthy purpose."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "I mean, if you sit down and my purpose is to get enlightened, but first you don't even know how to do breath meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "So the sense of purpose I'm talking about here is not an abstract purpose, which might be some distant one, which might be important for us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (3 of 5) With Joy and Dispair", "completion": "Without really becoming wise about the hindrances, you probably won't get reliably, healthily concentrated."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Whereas equanimity, if you were actually had a bird's eye view and really saw all the causes and conditions of what is happening and what's arising and passing in the world, there would be a sense of ease and openness of having this expansive, spacious view of what's arising and passing."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "Well, it was obvious that in, in, in our group, we're all dealing with a lot."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "We're all dealing with a lot and we are managing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "And that was a beautiful, beautiful meditation that you, that you provided for us this evening."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Practicing Equanimity in Challenging Times", "completion": "So whatever works for you."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "I'm just taking in how you are right now and no judgment, but just kind of like taking inventory."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "This relaxation connecting to the conditions that support the meditation and clining towards relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "You could say as kind of a setting up a container for the meditation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Just aware of what's here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "So maybe there's awareness of sensations in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Maybe sensations of feet or hands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "All of that is known through actual sensations."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "What is the actual experience happening in the present moment? In this way, touching into essentially how our physical body communicates."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "It communicates through sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Sensation and Feeling Tone", "completion": "Letting go of that for now, for the last minute or so of the sitting, just letting the attention kind of float freely to whatever it's drawn to in the physical experience."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "We can use meditation to consciously cultivate that quality of wakefulness, alertness, bringing attention to this present reality."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "So if we wish to establish, develop a mind which is alert and awake, then how we hold the body, what we do with the body affects that."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "Does this have an impact on the mind's feeling of ease or calm, how is it, what is the effect of that relaxation, and letting the attention flow down through the body, moving gently down our neck into our shoulders, notice the sensations that are there as we bring attention to that area, the shoulders soften, relax, drop down a notch or two, often we go through life with our back tense and hunched shoulders up around our ears, we are in a safe place, surrounded by good people, there is nothing we have to be worried about, nothing we have to generate tension, stress about, your shoulders relax, your arms hang easily loosely by your sides, and letting his wave of relaxation then gently continue to flow down, your left arm and your right arm, relaxing them too, whether you have your hands in your lap or in your knees or wherever you choose to have them is not important the exact way we hold them, let the arms and hands be free of any kind of tension and tightness."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "As we establish this quality within the posture, the body both energetic and upright, fully relaxed, that supports the realisation, the embodiment of those qualities on the mental level as well."}
{"prompt": "Morning Guided Meditation: Aware of Body and Breath", "completion": "It helps us to find those aspects of mind that are also both completely peaceful, completely awake."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "So the place we're kind of aiming for is the place of just being able to be centered and balanced and accepting with whatever comes."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "How do I make my thoughts go away? And those are the kind of natural responses to this experience, but mindfulness, we don't offer a solution to that, exactly."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But the insight into addiction is a transforming insight, very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that's what the difference between a transforming insight and a regular insight is."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "But I think that one of the things that the people who wrote the 12-step literature were doing were using words that were very powerful and really got your attention."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism and 12 Steps (1 of 5)", "completion": "And that sort of implies a helplessness or no responsibility."}

{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "They had slightly different transition back from retreat into our non-retreat practice."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Things may be changed for quite a long time."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "There's conditions in our lives, what has happened to us, what we need to do, these things, these activities, the things, the responsibilities we could bring that word back in."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "What's suitable for one person at one time might or might not be suitable for that same person, another day or another hour."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "We just don't usually give it this name of clear comprehension of suitability."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "It felt like there was a kind of a sacredness that came into the house."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And the first skillful means, or suitable tool that I found useful, is a really light touch of practice that I think earlier in my meditation, when I was early, just practicing early on in my meditation, I really was trying very hard to be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And yet, in this book, something about this book, which was Every Day Zen by Joko Beck, gave me the idea of not trying to be mindful all day long, but just picking a couple of things, some projects, just trying to find a couple of things to be mindful of."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "I guess I go back to work."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And that kind of lightness of just receiving an experience, and not like then trying to pick up the mindfulness like a backpack and carry it around with me all day, but just like, it arose, it met something in that moment and a very light touch of meeting it."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "So this happened for me, again, in my practice I kind of had the idea that being mindful meant that I was aiming my mind at particular types of experience."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "There can be a way that we explore our activities in connection with that purpose."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And you might then reflect on other ways like consciously connecting to being kind to other people in the store."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Can we let go of some of those things? And yet there's often a, I think a lot of this exploration is kind of a curiosity about what's the motivation, what is our, so the purpose, the intention that we're engaging with when we do our actions."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "You know, maybe offering something to somebody, but you know, wanting them to like us in return, you know, so there's mixed motivations."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And so there's mixed motivations in there."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "Be honest with yourself that the unskillful motivations exist, and maybe you can also connect with the more skillful motivation."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "And yet, what I began exploring was, okay, well, this is what I'm doing."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "How can the Dharma come into this? And aside from the whole, you know, bringing the mindfulness into the daily activities, which I was doing, you know, bringing my mindfulness into the going to work and being with people, being kind to people at work, all of that, I was exploring that."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "There we are, all in our individual cars, all stuck together in these traffic jams."}
{"prompt": "Clear Comprehension of Suitability", "completion": "It opens the heart, it brings joy and happiness and delight and nourishes those qualities as we engage with the conscious recognition, the conscious awareness of them."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But it's a beautiful idea, beautiful movement of the mind, beautiful practice to let go, but it needs to be done wisely."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But the clinging to the partner is where the suffering can come."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So if letting go, if hanging on, clinging has become the predominant movement of the mind, we're always clinging and wanting and hanging on to things."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And you can see that sometimes just in the nature of our thinking, how much wanting there can be sometimes in thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And that can start with small things."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "You might not think that's what you're doing."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And I kind of went through a very quick kind of little calculation in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Letting go into relaxing a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Maybe you have layers of relaxation your body can do and it's nice to relax."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "If you understand that what's your beliefs, your emotions, your fears, whatever it might be that's preventing you from letting go, if you feel how limiting those are, then it might be much easier to let go of the thing that you thought of letting go of."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And anyway, if I park two blocks away rather than one block away, I'll be late for being mindful."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So you don't, you know, you've given up letting go of it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And now what you can do is you're going to really get to know it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And that does a number of things."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And you'll find that there's almost like the more awareness you give, the more aware you are of the holding pattern itself, the more you'll notice that within the holding there is already a movement to relax and to let go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And your mind goes away from the thoughts of fury, the thoughts of self-righteousness, the thoughts of all these things, the ideas that we're holding onto."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "That's really the heart of it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But what happens if you drop into the somatic experience? Let yourself cling and let go into it, feel it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "An unattractive idea, the idea of letting go just seems like these Buddhists don't understand."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But rather investigate the situation, consider it a little more deeply."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "We always want to let go of the clinging to something, right? So you can always let go of the clinging, but you don't have to physically or literally stop using or stop doing the activity."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "This is a very relevant question in Silicon Valley."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So I'm not sure, you know, there's so many different aspects of what you're bringing up."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "We have to also, and then sometimes with a lot of loss and the pain of that, new unhealthy beliefs come into play."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "You know, how many deaths you said? 64, that's a lot."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Or letting go of the beliefs that I shouldn't, letting go of the beliefs that I shouldn't feel this loss or all these things."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And there's something wrong with us if we're not feeling good."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "There are certainly debilitating and unhealthy ways of being depressed that needs medical care, psychiatric care."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "But some depressions are actually part of a healthy functioning of the human being."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And that it can end up being something to beat myself up with."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "It sits for 45 minutes and not move and kind of let go of all kinds of impulses, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of things that come along."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "Just keep letting go to be here."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And the one thing that I was most important for was my anger."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And you really want to understand it and get below it and what triggers it and what's really going on more deeply."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And even at some times when I remember, I kind of congratulated myself, Gil, you let go, that was good."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "I just wanted to ask, if you think there are different qualities of letting go, do you think the ones that were meaningful where you felt a little joy, that there was an insight connected to it, or what do you think distinguishes? That's a nice question."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "I think it's so much more wonderful when the letting go does itself, rather than I'm the one who's letting go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "So maybe one more? Up here in the front, they've been trying."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And the context is my dad, who, like if you try to give him a hug, he just goes like this and gets really upset, like angry."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "He probably, and figure out what he does want."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "It was a great conversation last night."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go", "completion": "And I do hope that you give some, this next week, maybe you give some real consideration, experimentation and practicing of this letting go and see how it's useful for you and how it can be an improvement and how it in some situations will protect you from making it worse."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "This is the path that the Buddha taught to the realization of deep and profound and ultimate peace."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The sixth is right effort, Samavayama."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The eightfold path is called an ennobling path."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "You don't have to bother with your daily practice."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "And then the entire path becomes the very definition of the last step which is called the right samadhi or right concentration, samasamadhi which describes the fulfillment of the path or the fulfillment of concentration as the fulfillment of the path."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "So it's interesting to just see how all of these factors begin to intertwine and support each other."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "We never just practice a one-fold path or a two-fold path or a three-fold path or just sort of pick our favorites."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's impossible to practice a noble eight-fold path with only a piece of it."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It falls apart as a path that way."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "So the second is right intention or right thought, samasankapa."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The intention of renunciation, the intention of non ill will, the intention of non cruelty, this is called right intention."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "In the Angutra Nakaya, the Buddha says, monks, a wise person, one of great wisdom, does not intend harm to self, intend harm to others, or intend harm to both self and others."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "For instance, a parent might spank a child out of a very good motivation in terms of discipline."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Our intentions and our attitudes, they affect our experience."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's the abstaining from those, but this person has not yet realized the cessation of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "One who has had some degree, maybe not perfect, but some degree of insight into the third noble truth, realizes to some extent the causes of suffering and the cessation of those causes."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Now, when we consider right livelihood, we usually consider it the issues to extend quite a bit beyond a simply abstaining from these five very harmful trades."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "We'll need some effort to restrain, to refrain from wrong speech and we'll need some effort to cultivate right speech."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "Right effort is defined as the effort to abandon the wrong path and to enter upon the right path."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "In fact, many of the ways that we are finding mindfulness taught in the West in contemporary times divorces mindfulness from the ethics from liberation and from the rest of the eightfold path."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "But this is not intrinsically liberating."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "You've probably all seen cats that can be very attentive and very steady and yet very relaxed and very precise in their attention, you know, when they see some little movement in the grass and they can watch that little hole and there can be a kind of cat-like quality sometimes to our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's like it's a buzzword."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "The concentration of a downhill skier at the peak of performance is not necessarily right concentration."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not enough to just not do to abstain from unwholesome things."}
{"prompt": "The Noble Eightfold Path", "completion": "It's not just a matter of abiding by them as a set of rules or a set of guidelines."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So there might be this kind of resistance to developing and cultivating this."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Maybe we would never notice that unless we were given these instructions or trying to cultivate these practices."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "And then we can work with them."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "There is painful practice with slow insight."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "And as the Buddha pointed out a big part of training the mind which is what meditation practice is is learning to deal with the skillful thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "What is important for my life? How do I want to spend my time and energy? Because it's easy to go through our lives aimlessly without some clear direction or sense of what we want to do and it's easy to let ourselves get sucked in by the media out there."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "They'd prefer that you have more of kind of a short-sighted view and live your life just with the sense of what do you want in the next moment so that you would buy more things or jump onto the bandwagon to dogmatically choose a particular side on any particular debate."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "And of course we can reflect on, remember some, any benefits bringing to mind any of the positive experiences or positive capacities that have arisen since starting the practice."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Maybe it's easier to see the bigger picture if you have a meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Maybe this translates into having some greater ease in your relationships, relationship to yourself, your relationship to others."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Of course it might not always happen on the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "But transformative minds doesn't happen only in formal meditation."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Instead it can just be a natural extension of what we had been doing intermittently perhaps throughout the day, or maybe we are mindful for most of the day."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Often unrealistic expectations, or maybe even all expectations, aren't so obvious in the front of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "So another unrealistic expectation that we can let go of to be a support for us if we find that we're struggling or resisting and don't want to practice or we're in the midst of practice and we're finding some difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "In the same way that we don't learn to play the guitar or to knit or whatever it might be, immediately, sometimes we forget that we're first learning to play tennis but there's so many balls that whiz right past us before we quite learn how to volley or playing guitar or the piano or knitting, whatever it might be that in the beginning, it just takes time to develop skill."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "Having compassion for ourselves when we recognize that there is some resistance or some sense of struggle going on."}
{"prompt": "Resisting", "completion": "For example, these ideas that there should never be thoughts or that results should come quickly or somehow there should be a certain amount of ease with this."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "This is an opportunity to focus on the heart center and use the mind in a constructive way by reflecting on the skillful actions of body, speech, and mind that we engaged in today."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "Keeping in mind that help is available, particularly the help that comes from the Buddha, the doctor, as he encourages us to use the medicine of mindfulness in the presence of the sangha, the nurse."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "You can be mindful of feeling numb and you can be mindful of feeling, you know, absolutely terrible and you can be mindful of, you know, the feelings of hopefulness."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "And I was just teaching a course for psychologist at Spirit Rock and I had the great honor of doing it with one of my colleagues and mentors in the Department of Psychiatry at UCSF."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "So the question is that a lot of these medicines work and that there are realistic things in life that create these difficult mind states like anxiety and depression."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "So when you know them, that's mindfulness that you could use to then apply medicine."}
{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 3)", "completion": "And then medicine number two is that we have to ask ourselves what are the most nourishing things I could do right now rather than depleting things?

{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "The other reason I think it's not that helpful is, how do you assess the truth of it? I could say I'm enlightened, and so what does that do for you? You have no way of knowing whether that's true or not true, or whether I'm deluding myself, or whether."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "I do think it's important, and I'm all for goals and practice."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Why are we here? In the big metaphysical sense."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Well, first to say, renunciation is not my strong point."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So, you know, we've just been, as if the fulfillment of our desires is going to somehow make us ultimately happy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So just another sequence of teachings that I've found really helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Starting with impermanence again."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And that gives a visceral experience of the freedom of disenchantment."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "The translation is Viraga, basically non-lustful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "But because there is space, we are mindful, correct? I mean in the very moment, it's like when I move to C when I asked myself, how am I getting hooked? In that, in the moment of asking the question, I was no longer angry."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So that's the value of going to C."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So then we can say that we are practicing mindfulness depending on how we're relating to the obstacle."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "Applying mindfulness externally in that very, you could call it a gross sense, oh, I can be mindful of this person's breathing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And so not only running it, but you've been practicing in running it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "And very often our interactions really bring up things that we don't see otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 2", "completion": "So we have a whole staff Dharma program."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "In the same way that an infant may crawl away from where you'd like them to be and you gently say, oh, no, sweetie, over here and you give them a little bit of a nudge or guide them."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "Allowing it to be what it is and simply noticing."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And the path to me is about, there's this connection with walking a path, hiking a mountain, finding our way."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And it's not so much that the path itself is noble, but the people walking it are nobily walking it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "But maybe we don't always."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And it's really important for me and for all of us at IMC and all of us who are teaching this program to know that you each and every single one of you are welcome here."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And mindfulness itself is a form of respectful engagement with everything and everyone."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And we'll be viewing through a path factor or experience to sort of get more into the depths of that particular path factor."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "He says, keep your eyes fixed on the way to the top, but don't forget to look at your feet."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So this is what is meant by the middle way, finding this place of freedom, allowing joy to happen, allowing sorrow to happen and to be with it and to be clear."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So as I mentioned, it's, I'm presenting this as, you know, as we do in a more of a one step one through eight or these processes that we go through these three path factors."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So the way that we like to do the breakout are that one of us will assign them their random."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "So you're in a separate room."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "And also it's fine to sign off and then sign back on."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I mean, in terms of confidentiality, it's not really our place to share what somebody else said in a different context."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Introductory Session (guided Oori, Talk Tanya, Talk Chris)", "completion": "I know it's true for the live programs over the years that many people say at the end that they hated the idea in the beginning of breakout groups, but in the end they decided it was the best part of the programs meeting the people, getting a chance to share in this format that is, you know, pretty meditative that we try to keep those formats in that way."}

{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "The challenge is, this is that most of us, even though if I passed out a piece of paper, would most likely sign that they're quite happy to be enlightened."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "But the general principle is not necessarily that difficult to see."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I am conflicted around, I guess my question would be, can you compare what kind of renunciation either of you experienced prior to being a nun compared to what it is as a monastic and any offerings for how to lay people really renunciate? I can speak from my own experience and we can see if others here would like to share their experience up front here."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I thought I had a really together practice when I went to the monastery."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And I was very surprised at how much I suffered when I got there."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "So those kinds of things took a lot of letting go, and I didn't realize how hard they were."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "One of the ways in which a monastic community can undermine a lay community is when the perception is that the monastic way of practicing is best."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Is there something that we can use or learn from that in a way which is relevant for us? Does that help answer your question? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Well, either if you'd like to share about what it's like being a monastic and how different it is from being a lay person."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "That was very challenging."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I have been discussing life changes with some of my friends who are engineers and are pilots."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I'm wondering if you could just speak on that."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "Understanding is the ability to stand under."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "I started very young to expose myself."}
{"prompt": "The Peace of Letting Go", "completion": "And so I decided not to sleep at all."}

{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "That is this idea of what I'll call, and others call, that inner critic."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "So if you might have thought that you were the only one and that everybody else maybe has some version of, has all their ducks in a row, but this turns out to be quite prevalent."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And also an impact of the inner critic is it can squelch a sense of our asking ourselves really deep questions, including the questions of what are my highest aspirations, what's really important for me, what do I want in my life, how can my life unfold in a way that's meaningful for me, how might I live my life now so that at the end of my life I feel like yes, I lived it according to what was important, meaningful for me."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "We don't want to ask those questions, we're afraid that the next thing might be oh well you can't do it anyway."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "For us to look towards that, what are the conditions and what are the actions as opposed to this feeling of what is it that I'm doing wrong? How am I wrong? So the inner critic can work by singling something out in our experience and making that significant."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "It might be an email that we receive that has a tone that isn't quite right or maybe the ending or the salutation or the ending, I'm not sure what that's called, maybe it's the ending salutation, the way that they close their email."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "I mean the computer was on maybe just a few minutes before there was something supportive and wholesome was in an email or something that was on our computer or at that same time we were most likely maybe not sitting in a chair or maybe looking at our phones."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Going along with this example I gave earlier about receiving an email that didn't feel quite right or maybe wasn't as warm as we had hoped or whatever it might have been."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "We often think about that it's just because of us that email had that way arrived."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "This one that it singles out at a particular event and makes it very significant."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And with mindfulness to also notice the tone of our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "This attention with a quality of befriending."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "If there's just a little bit of spaciousness our inner critic could just fill that up."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "We it's our perception is colored."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "Maybe it can be this affectionate sense of."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "And is asking us to look at ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Inner Critic", "completion": "So in this way working with the inner critic can be part of creating the world a world in which we all want to live in."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "He said, no, that's not true."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And when I listened to the talk, I said, this is awfully pedantic."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So the Four Noble Truths for him were the container."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "After all, he said at some other point that all he taught was suffering and the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So the teaching of the Four Noble Truths takes on the assumption that you want happiness and you're willing to act on it."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Which ones are skillful and which ones are not."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "If something is going to cause you suffering, if it's stressful, if it's changing all the time, is it worth calling yourself, is it worth claiming as you or yours? It's basically a value of judgment."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Whereas if you say that something is in constant, it's like trying to sit comfortably on a chair where the legs are uneven."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "One is the term, the Pali term, anicca."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And if you can't depend on it, is it stressful or is it easel? It's stressful."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "I've misunderstood my relationship to them."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So you apply that perception both to the suffering and to the causes of suffering."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "In order to do it, it's based on desire."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So for the time being, you don't apply these three perceptions to the path itself."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And he says of those five, the first three are not all that serious."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "As you get more skilled in the concentration, learn that you can rely on it, then it's easier to look at the other things around you that you've been holding on to."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And we let go of those, then if your mind is at the right point, now letting go doesn't mean you go back to being unvirtuous or unconcentrated."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The Johns give lots of images for this."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "One is being a carpenter working on a piece of furniture."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "However, these teachings morphed as they got into the commentaries."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Because after all, once the king sets a question, you can't say, that's a stupid question."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "This is the nature of reality out there."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And when they describe the Buddha's awakening, it's described as the Buddha's seeing that things were impermanent, stressful that there was no self."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Now, as a result of this, four misunderstandings come up that you find common in modern Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "You just have to learn to accept that things are going to come, they're going to go."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Images that you often see about this."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "One, as I said, is the image of the dancer."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "People can react to impermanence in lots of different ways."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "There is no true long-term happiness in life, you just learn how to accept things as they come and go, and if you're peaceful about that and calm about that, then you'll be okay."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "So basically what it is, it's a value judgment that we're making."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And then he had this arrangement with him that he would call them up at random hours of the day and if he happened to catch them when they were doing the thing that they said was happy, and ask them, are you happy? And it turned out the answer was, well, not especially."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And as a result of following this, the Buddha says you can, to do this however, you need an alternative source of food and that's what the path provides."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "The image the Buddha gives instead of having you lying on the beach watching the waves come in, he says you're actually crossing over a river and you're going to be standing on firm ground where you are safe from the waves of the river."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "When you get on ground, you don't have to worry about them."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Now in terms of the views, it's interesting that image of the raft."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "It provides guidelines for what you should and shouldn't do."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "But that's what it comes down to."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "I've personally found the Eightfold Path very helpful."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And I'm actually OK with that."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "He said, you know, the people who have attained nirvana, if they could take it out and show it to you, that's all you would want."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "It makes permanent changes."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Is this happening to you? I can't say."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Why not? Because there's a rule against it."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "And I said, I can't answer that because the Buddha said not to answer that question."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "I work a lot with the teaching of the A-worldly winds, and that seems like a teaching that says that it's not possible to escape pleasure pain and A-worldly winds."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Without him we wouldn't even know that there was a path."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Admirable friends are the half of the holy life."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Without me the Buddha said, oh, no one else would know the way."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "Okay, because I was going to say then that it seemed from what you were saying earlier in the talk that it's okay for us to lose wealth, our health, our relatives."}
{"prompt": "In the Elephant's Footprint", "completion": "That's a whole other talk."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation Body Scan", "completion": "We're not trying to imagine things."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation Body Scan", "completion": "Guiding awareness to the throat."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation Body Scan", "completion": "And this way just very gently scanning through the different parts, the different regions, the different areas of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation Body Scan", "completion": "Maybe through different passes through the body you might find that the changes."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation Body Scan", "completion": "So now I'll be silent so you can do a body scan at your own pace."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Welcome friends, it's good to be here with you."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Our habit is often to struggle to get rid of unpleasant experience, such as our reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "There can be a space of receiving experience simply as experience, even when the experience is something that the mind believes is in the way of practice."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "We release from these patterns of stress and struggle."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And yet this pattern of trying to get our experience to be how we think it should be is deeply conditioned and will inevitably continue to unfold in our practice."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And we can just know, oh, what is this pull? What is this pull or push? What does that feel like? And get to understand and become intimate with it."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "We're gathering information about our lived reality so that this understanding can naturally arise."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And we tend to just identify with this."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Perhaps dropping in the question, what's being believed right now might illuminate the belief, oh, if I'm practicing right, the mind will be peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And yet, in this description of right practice in the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha says, when the mind is peaceful, one knows the mind is peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And when the mind is agitated, one knows the mind is agitated."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "These beliefs are simply, in terms of the five aggregates, are mental formations."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "But rather, it's the quality of how we're attending to whatever is arising in our experience that will naturally cultivate these wholesome qualities."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "So we don't have to try to make there be tranquility or concentration or wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And when we observe that the mind naturally does this, of course it will, we learn that that kind of reactivity actually is what is at the root of our stress and suffering."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "It's not ultimately within our control."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And that not understanding these, that kind of not seeing these aspects of our experience is what underlies the mind's tendency to hold on tightly to cling, to identify."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And this understanding ripens what flows naturally from our hearts is all of these wholesome qualities, the Brahma Viharas, loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, which is the delight in the well-being of others."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Why identify with and become attached to it, passing judgment upon it and ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "As soon as you open and relax this tight fist of grasping, infinite space is there."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Nothing to do or undo, nothing to force, nothing to want and nothing missing."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Thank you for your practice and attention."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Well, there's two, they thank you."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Right, but also, I realize that in this case at least today, in the nature of my work, the things you're saying and the awarenesses, the awareness happening in me, it is associative because I then think, oh, this would be helpful in this way, or this would be helpful in this way."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Yeah, it really sounds like there's a skillful perspective on it and just really encourage the continuing to kind of regard that as just a natural, a natural part of what we are training to or practicing with, learning to be with in a skillful way, yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Now that I'm out of the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And yeah, there's definitely like a layer of thin film of aversion on top of the hindrance."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And all of that is also just, you know, also just mental activity at the same level of the original object that you are noticing like the hindrance and then so it's great that you're seeing that and just, it's kind of like, it can feel kind of like a never ending kaleidoscopic stepping back of like, oh, well, there's a relationship to that."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And so there's a gradation of ways that are really skillful to be in relationship to or respond to our experience."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "So when there is like you said like on retreat, this is often the experience that on retreat, there's a bit more subtleness and inner resources and capacity."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "But there's a sutra where the Buddha says there's five ways of working with, with, I think this one is distracting thoughts, but it could be like any, any, any difficult experience."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "And yet when it is really kind of ramping things up to try to just stay with it, then it's really, you know, listen to the wisdom that knows that it's, it's going to be really supportive to and caring to shift here."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on the Relationship to Experience", "completion": "Gritting that sounds a little over efforting."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "So for today's practice, what I'd like to invite us to engage with today is the practice of forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "Of course, there are many wars at any time going on and people living under oppression, and especially now, especially now in the world stage."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "You might have practiced in this way."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "So it's a radical practice of, of forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "Moistening, moistening the heart, moistening the heart with compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "In any way that I have been unable to be with and to respond skillfully to the pain and suffering of our world, my own pain and that of others."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "I'm going to try that and if it doesn't come through here we go."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "That's that's the trap if If the animal lets go opens its hand then it can open the hand and be set free But the fist the fist so get to see Get to see that the fist is keeping you You trapped and just have kindness have kindness towards not being able to let go Slowly slowly slowly Let's see Hilda says I noticed that when I focused on forgiving gratitude followed soon after Gratitude for the learning opportunity through difficulty."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "Can you point to more teachings about how not to take things personally? Oh That is a bigger container That's basically pointing to the teachings so many teachings, but but that's really um the teachings on Impersonality or not self or anata."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radical Forgiveness", "completion": "It's impersonal things are so impersonal and the way to see Impersonality, there's so many different ways, but one way As I was talking about it this morning at 7 a."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "What's on my mind today is news of the world."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "And so this interface and how we are in relationship to the world, it's actually it's poignant and it's beautiful and it's heartbreaking."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "And so that really kind of land with how am I in relationship to the world."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "And sometimes, you know, from here in this place where I am, you know, I felt like, well, there's not much I can actually do physically."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "But this movement of keeping the heart open and well-wishing, wishing for freedom from suffering, wishing for safety and freedom from fear for all beings, wishing for freedom from confusion for all beings."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "That is actually, it is a kind of an action that I think does have ripple effects."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "Sometimes I think, you know, we think about the precept sometimes as being, you know, simple actions or something, but, you know, they're not actually so simple in some ways."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "Whether we're experiencing some kind of struggle in a relationship or at a work situation, or whether we're experiencing delight and joy over the celebration of a birth."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "So this deep connection to how am I in this moment? It's like it expands outward to how are you? How are you too? And so it really is this connection between being with ourselves, being present, being mindful with this kind of just, how am I in this moment? The curiosity of the human experience of it."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "We often talk about it in that way in the terms of wisdom, the growth of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "So I'm just offering my reflections this evening and that's where they wound up."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "But it is so important just, just to be with it and to, and to ask ourselves what, what is going on for me right now."}
{"prompt": "Taking In the World", "completion": "It's, it's kind of, it's, it's the world resonating with this sensitive organ, this sensitive organism."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (4 of 5) What is in our Depths", "completion": "And we have the ability to imagine stories as if they're real and they feel them in our emotional life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (4 of 5) What is in our Depths", "completion": "And that's part of the advantage of getting calm and subtle in meditation is that we can start hearing or seeing or recognizing the deeper ways, deeper currents of belief, of thoughts, of attitudes that are in us, that are often overlaid by discursive thinking or judgmental thinking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (4 of 5) What is in our Depths", "completion": "And that deeper layer is valuable to see."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (4 of 5) What is in our Depths", "completion": "And also the attempt to go into the positive, sometimes it's wonderful to do and nice to do, I don't want to say never do it, but it often carries with it even deeper attitudes, a deeper belief around self, me, myself, and mine, like I'm the agent, and then, only then will people really love me."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (4 of 5) What is in our Depths", "completion": "But you might also see if this can be a day where this deeper, quieter listening, and you might have a busy day, but maybe there are little corners of the day where you can sit quietly and just kind of tap in."}

{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "Simple things, complicated things."}
{"prompt": "Doing What's Meaningful", "completion": "So in order to sustain our energy for our practice, there's a number of different things we can do, including really looking at our underlying beliefs about the difference we can make, what's possible for us, and what's meaningful for us."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (1 of 5) Visible Here and Now", "completion": "And when one has a confirmed confidence, because one has experienced the benefits and the transformations and the freedom from this practice, that it doesn't matter what I say, because you would know, you know, well I'm sorry for you Gild, you might say, but I know for myself how much I benefited."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (1 of 5) Visible Here and Now", "completion": "So what is it about Dharma that provides that? What do we see? What's going on here? And so there's a five-part description of what we have confidence in, and what we know, and it's possible in a sense to do kind of reverse engineering, to understand these five parts, and this will tell us what the Dharma is, in some kind of deeper way, as opposed to just some abstract teachings of the Buddha, or some kind of vague, I don't know, principles, or natural forces that we connect to, it's, you know, we really discover it for ourselves."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (1 of 5) Visible Here and Now", "completion": "But to have these drop away, to have the experience of life without them, can be life changing for some people, to know that there's another way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (1 of 5) Visible Here and Now", "completion": "So that's how the Buddha kind of elaborated on this idea that the Dharma is visible here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (1 of 5) Visible Here and Now", "completion": "So to see that over and over and over again, to see that, to develop this capacity to be here and now, that's kind of the direction that's going."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "We sit in motion, change when we practice."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "If I stand on a conveyor belt, these walking sidewalks that they have at the airport, I see them at the airport, you stand there and just carries you along."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "So this idea of being carried along, unfolding by the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "It's kind of like we can't do two things at once."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And so then it begins to relax and soften."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "It heightens our attention to notice when we bring in more strain again, we get tense again."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And they're not good for us, but as we have ease and de-stress, the system moves towards kind of a homeostasis of health and well-being, more or less."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And it feels like we're kind of on the gentle slide or in a current that all we have to do is stay out of the way, don't interfere with it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "We have our role, for sure, but that we can't engineer it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "And it would be a radically different world if we stop that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 ( 4 of 5) Stay Close", "completion": "Don't add problems on top of it."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It happens to be that Monday."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "So I feel a little bit shy about it and so I'm talking strongly."}

{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And the 800 is kind of a hippie commune that grew up out of the hate-ashbury era in San Francisco."}

{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "But also, there might be some degree of maybe unconscious at times holding back from giving birth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "There was, a lot of children died, quite young in age."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "Now, it's maybe a little bit risky for me to make this kind of supposition being a man."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "So, you know, very simple, if you take a knife and cut your finger, it hurts, you bleed."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It's what the Buddhists would call a pragmatic truth, or experiential truth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "That's one of the core truths of the Buddhist tradition."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "I think all of you probably had some experience of grasping, of clinging to something, and then had the experience of suffering because of that, and the experience of letting go."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "What are the truths that we need to understand to help us in this process of becoming free? So, the quote from Jesus then, the truth will set you free, works very well for Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And if that confession wasn't complete, then there might be some legal process that might kick in."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And then you're told to go make amends, deal with it, go talk to them, go ask for forgiveness, speak the truth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "There's power in speaking it and there's certain kind of other power in hiding the truth and not speaking it."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "You know, that's not what it means anymore."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And so in order to be true to our values, to our compassion, for everyone concerned, we have to do, maybe we have to be lying, say no."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "We say what we do and we do what we say."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And then I finally had to admit, oh, this is what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "My hesitancy in speech, which was once an annoyance, is now a pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "Its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words."}

{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "And everyone just meets each other like humans."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "What matters is how well you can speak and live the truth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It doesn't matter who you know."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "It does matter how much you tell yourself the truth."}
{"prompt": "Paramis: Truth", "completion": "So thank you, and thank you."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "Great, thank you for sharing that."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "I don't think we end up in the place of anger towards ourselves either even though we come into a state of responsibility and radical accountability, that radical accountability I think ultimately is compatible with love and care."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "And so I just want to say a word about this because it's very relevant for how we talk about anger, how we relate to it that if we feel like anger somehow points back to me is a commentary on who we are in some deep sense."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "We take good care of them."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "As we come into that more and more deeply, it will open our hearts."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "Just this is the aim of all this difficult practice we put ourselves through."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "When an infant is obstructed from her or his toy, there is a very universal response."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "It's important to say that anger has its uses, for sure."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "And I remember when we were sort of processing this and saying goodbyes of sorts over a course of a couple of weeks, I remember she, I knew she was angry at me, but she didn't say it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "Eventually she said, you know, she kind of lashed out a bit and expressed some real anger with me."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "So much of our history is really, we could say, the history of anger and hatred."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "So this may be slightly jarring language."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "This is alluding, of course, to that seductive power of the angry mind state."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "What is this like? And it's said to be like picking up a burning coal to throw at somebody, right? Burned, right? That is a little harder to see in some ways, to connect with the burning, because it's like the anger makes a certain deal with us."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "This is where the suffering arises and this is where the suffering collapses, diminishes, fades away."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "That when these get tangled together, we can get overwhelmed and they like play off one another, ping-ponging back and forth."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 1", "completion": "So we'll practice this on our meditation seats and then these are skills that generalize for how we relate to anger in our lives generally."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "So continuing again this reflection on not self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "Last week, we explored identity view and the 20 kinds of identity views."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "So different different ways of identifying."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I haven't worked with that framework enough to have it be very natural and easeful."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "So this, this can be used as a tool for us, this reflection can be used as a tool for us in our practice, maybe and I've used it at times when I felt caught by something."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And there's an identification happening here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "This is just causes and conditions are rising there's no self here, but we can also use the reflections."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "So that's one flavor of this, this kind of identification."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I'm not with emotional identification, the sense I am, at least for me that that can be a big place for this kind of of identification."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I did not have any say about consciousness arising."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I wasn't doing it, but it was happening to me."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And I'm also curious if you have, you know, more general questions, I want to take notes if there's questions that feel like they're bigger than that I could follow up on next time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "You know, so it's got that kind of, it's that impermanent unreliable quality that we can't stop so it's like all three of those understandings of impermanent unreliable not cells are right there in that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "I mean, it's basically you're seeing there you're seeing clinging."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "Yeah, that they just, there's no, there's no reliability anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "Yeah, I've noticed, just like, you know, how a dog shakes water off."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "It's going to be hard to teach this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And like the virtual thing think heavens were not that isolated and it's like, Yeah, that it's like that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "You know, I think longing is a good word."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And so, so I've really found a lot of honoring what's arising whatever sufferings arising is some form of this tangle between these truths of impermanent unreliable not self, and this wish of well being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: This is not Mine, This I am Not, This is not Myself", "completion": "And that presence is the tool that helps the mind to begin to see the those threads more clearly."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "So for the practice for today, so many beautiful practices to choose from."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "And, and to say sometimes when people are do this practice of meta loving kindness for all beings."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Oh, then at that point the practice becomes a practice of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "And if you want to keep the practice as a meta practice for all the just wishing well, then tuning into just the gift, the gift of generosity of the meta and imagining beings who are new in a neutral situation they're not suffering."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "So, so arriving in our bodies always starting with the body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "As if there is a fire, a holy fire in the middle of your chest, and the breath is bellowing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Just witnessing with each breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "You're just acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "We're not creating it, fabricating."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Those on Zoom, those on YouTube joining us."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Like, oh, you know what? Did she clean this part? Did she did what I said? So, just sitting here, I'm like, okay, let it be for 30 minutes and whatever it happens, just let it unfold and let it just let go of it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "One is regarding this letting go, the letting go, the letting go of control."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "So that's one reflection that comes out, which I appreciate you're playing with this letting go."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "You can include yourself in the Mehta in this practice, because it's all beings."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Yeah, because that's what you're essentially doing anyway."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "That's what I'm pointing out."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "Yeah, and reflection from someone who is on the retreat."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "It's really helping with the challenges of integration and missing being steeped into three jewels."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "So, so glad, Catherine, that you can join Papaya on YouTube and support the continuity."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "And then then you can share as much or as little as you like about your practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "I know we can have a little longer."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Radiating Metta to All Beings", "completion": "We have a couple of minutes for any reflections, what might have come up during either the practice, silently or in the group."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And at the end of the retreat, they were wondering, wow, why didn't I do this earlier? Why didn't I do this earlier in my practice? Because even though I've been doing all these wisdom and insight and mindfulness, just noticing that having a container of warmth, somebody described it as kind of having this golden gene to everything, all the practices, makes a difference, makes a real difference."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Or there might be this idea that everything seems so slippery."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "We think of it as a cultivation practice, but generosity itself is a letting go."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "So it's not only about believing or thinking or wishing or something about that, but it's an activity, a certain type of activity."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And chances are that you don't need me to tell you this idea that the Buddha encouraged us to cultivate ethical actions, to behave in the world in a way in which we don't cause harm, neither to ourselves nor to others, and sometimes that's not so easy."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "I'm using this word agitated really broadly, but it seems like we've created a world in which we're often like poked, notified, or somehow there's this way in which we get."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And this idea too, also with loving kindness and all the Brahmavihara's compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, also this unconditionality."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "We can easily fall into that kind of mind state or understanding of practice."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Like that's not the direction people want to go."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "We're not going towards in a way that has this personal diminishment or in a way that suggests any type of weakness that we just have to let go because we're not able to hold on or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And something that I like is this story that's in the Vinaya about Ananda, the Buddha's attendant."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And I hear about this a lot on retreats."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "I'm sure all of us have this idea, right, of things that we didn't used to like."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And we have different priorities in our older life that we didn't have when we were young."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "But there's a way in which there's not only letting go, but also the compulsion to want to grab on in the first place."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "And let go of that, let it be softened."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "It's a movement of the heart, this idea of giving up."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Be sensitive to that state."}
{"prompt": "Simplifying Practice to Two Types", "completion": "Then letting go or giving up just becomes more and more something that the mind and the body and the heart just want to do."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And it's sometimes very confusing to be able to answer a question such as, well, what is Buddhism when we're aware of all of these different things? And attempts have been made."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "They are embodying its ideas and its values in the context of their specific lives."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It also, by looking at this idea of it building up these great big superstructures, shows that it never remains completely stuck in a particular form."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But they wouldn't see, at least at first glance, their differences being because of their cultural and historical circumstances, rather because of the legitimacy or otherwise of the doctrines and teachings and practices that they have in their schools."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Going back to my example of this great big superstructure of Buddhism, what I want to do is to respectfully start dismantling it, not destroying it, in order to get back to what seems to be the foundational basis for it."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "What was he like? What sort of world did he live in? I've been fascinated by this question for many, many years."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "They've never bothered to do that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "We can come back to that later perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "So what I'd like to do today is to experiment and I'm going to be focusing on a fairly narrow range of ideas, which you'll be familiar with, and try to get back to the source of where they came from."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "As long as my knowledge and vision, this is the Buddha speaking, as long as my knowledge and vision was not entirely clear about X, I did not claim to have had a peerless awakening in this world, awakening or peerless enlightenment in this world."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Not just contemporary teachers we might listen to in this room, but traditions themselves."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And so we likewise find a tendency within Buddhist tradition itself, within the superstructure of the building."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "This is probably, this is the first teaching the Buddha is supposed to have given a few weeks after his awakening to his five ascetic companions, his five former companions in asceticism in the Deer Park at Sarnat."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It's a text that all Buddhist traditions have translated into Tibetan, to Chinese, Japanese, and it is the Buddha's first discourse."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Now, what is striking for me about this passage, particularly when we realize it's the twelve aspects of the Four Noble Truths, so in that sense nobody got it right, is that rather than identify his awakening, or enlightenment, as having to do with gaining insight into some truth, he actually describes his awakening to be about four truths, and not only four truths, but twelve aspects of four truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "If you look in the Upanishads, and particularly those we know to have existed prior to the Buddha, and two of these would be the Brydjaranaka Upanishad and the Chandogya Upanishads, there you find the description of yogic or spiritual practice of tapas as having to do with disassociating one's consciousness from the multiplicity and the plurality of the phenomenal world, which is considered somewhat illusory, and returning to the source of one's experience by turning inwards and touching or recovering union with the divine, Brahman."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "I think this is deliberately provocative."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "We're not one thing, me, or even my mind."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It has as much to do with what you."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "When you go into feelings, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, particularly when you go into sankhara, the volitional elements, the active elements of your experience, that breaks down into numerous mental factors."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Open them again, and ooh, here again."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Now this must have come as a bit of a shock, particularly the bit about defecating and urinating, that meditation for the Buddha is paying attention to what are considered mundane and perhaps even lowly and rather disgusting things."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "I haven't even started really, because what I really want to look at today are what he means by the twelve aspects of the Four Noble Truths, because that's the key."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But I hope that what I've said this morning at least gives you a sense that the Buddha seems to be talking about our spiritual, religious life in a very different way, not only to what we find in Brahmanic orthodoxy, but also what we find as a kind of default in many spiritual and mystical and religious traditions."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Let's have a period of feedback."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Therefore, that statement is true."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "I think the Buddha is not using the word truth in that way, but he's using it more in a pragmatic sense."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "The Buddha wasn't just bang in life and one day, as though it was in a void, as Buddhist tradition often suggests actually, but rather was a very self-conscious reflection and critique of Upanishadic tradition."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And how he says at the end of his, when he describes his awakening, he says, what I have, this dharma I have found goes against the stream."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It goes against what we assume."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And my opening question and your answers kind of exposed the fact that what the Buddha did say is not what we imagined him to be saying."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "I can't remember the quote exactly, but it's in a discussion that the Buddha is having with someone who's saying, well, you know, all of these different teachers teach what are apparently different truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "And this is what then gives rise to lots of internal conflict within the canon itself."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "He used different strategies at different times."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "But the Buddha, certainly in these early texts, does not ground his sense of morality on an appeal to a transcendent source of morals."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "Could you pass the microphone to this gentleman with the glasses? Hi."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "So I just wanted to get your take on that."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "That was not an idea you find in the Upanishads."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 1)", "completion": "It doesn't really matter because the Brahmin priests are not celibate monks."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So last week we were interrupted by the elections."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "Maybe torpor is a little more common."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And you have to kind of contend with that if you're trying to meditate at that point."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I mean, you can't even walk fast, or talk faster."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And if I finally stop doing the thing that's, you know, that's interrupting what I want to do, I get more energy back."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So frustrated desire for some people can produce dullness, lethargy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "We don't want to do what's being asked of us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But adults, apparently adults do this also."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And that is a lot of people do live hyped up lives and always busy, always doing something."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So there's plenty of people who associate meditation with getting calm."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And if you push the calming too far, you'll fall asleep."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "We kind of lower our, I don't know if there's writing analogy, and I write the expression for meditation, but we lower our guard."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "Well, finally I've arrived."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So these are some of the kind of causes for sloth and torpor."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I've had the experience of kind of being somehow clear and not being sleepy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I'm just going to kind of globally tire it and sleepy and just very dull."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "But they had this big bell."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And your person that rings the bell has to sit in front of that bell."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And so I was sitting meditating during the meditation session, and then I nodded off."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "I hadn't gotten worried about what people were going to think about me."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "If you're capable of it, and not everyone is capable for by any means, but the half lotus position where you cross your legs and half lotus and full lotus are yogic postures that bring a really good energy."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So you sit up there and full lotus."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "Your face, your neck, your hands, and your feet before you meditate can stimulate it will keep you awake."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "Oh, then I have to face the fact that I'm so depressed."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "So it's very important to learn to recognize the seed."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "And the first hindrance of central desire has its root in greed."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sloth and Torpor", "completion": "The wisdom is wisdom, right? So the wake-up-ism."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And so I missed a couple of words about meditation techniques."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "So that establishment of mindfulness is a kind of a steadiness of mindfulness, a concentration essentially."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "The establishment of mindfulness does not require us to start with one object."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then begin to broaden."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "But to kind of that sense of what's the most easeful way to be aware."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then as another experience, the attention is drawn to another experience."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "There's a term in the Pali Canon aditana, which means resolve, which is often used in the, in concentration practice, that we kind of express a direction or an intention towards something."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "I offered one of them in the, in the guided meditation."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Sometimes, not always, but sometimes the mind becomes very amenable to kind of a curiosity about these requests or these intentions."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And so I found with a certain level of relaxation of body and mind, I could drop in a request for relaxation and then just be available to see what happened."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then I might notice some areas of the body relaxing that I didn't even know were held in tension."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "May the attention rest with the breathing, may the breathing become comfortable more and more pleasantness."}
{"prompt": "Reflections on Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Kind of a request, not a demand, not looking for something, but what's available to be known."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "But I need to stop long enough to see that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "That's why I like sometimes to call it softening rather than relaxing, softening around something."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Or, you know, they won't relax if they will relax on their own if I get out of the way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Trust the happiness, trust the anxiety, trust the sadness, trust the joy, trust that it's okay to be present for it, that has a place in your life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "And lo and behold, I might notice that side by side with the anxiety is some confidence."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "But it's not a naïve trust."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "It's not like you just go up to someone and say, just trust your life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "And one of the great things to trust is that the difficult, our difficulties, our inner difficulties, our difficult emotions and feelings we have, no matter how terrible they are, it's that there's a art to trusting anything and all of it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Trusting Life", "completion": "Take your time with all this stuff."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And that intention is for goodwill, friendliness, kindness, the kind of open-hearted, receptive love."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "So loving kindness is a translation of the Pali word metta in Sanskrit that's matri or mitri."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And if you don't, just come along for the ride and give this a shot."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "Find that balance between relaxation with just a touch of alertness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "You can probably see in the mind's eye how careful and gentle and alert they are, even reverent perhaps."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "See if you can ride the waves of the in-breath and the out-breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "As you notice the breath, the sounds in the room, the aliveness of your body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "See if you can scan, allow, discover."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And perhaps in the quiet of this room, you can again discover some of the fundamental wishes we all share, every living being shares."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And acknowledging that perhaps you might also see if in some corner of your mind or in some part of your being, you might notice the wish to be happy, to flourish."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "Perhaps there's a way you can find to connect that to the wish that each of us share to be healthy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Metta, Week 1(a)", "completion": "And if in some deep, quiet space within you somewhere, you might connect with the wish to be at peace, at ease."}
{"prompt": "Saturday Sitting with Evening Reflections on radiating metta and letting go", "completion": "So this again is the loving kindness, to love what is mortal and to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it, and when the time comes to let it go, to let it go."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "It's an emphatic, an intensifier."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "But the Buddha's suggesting we don't fully know."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And that, I think, is the crucial point."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And we start with a breath."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Mara is still there, Mara saturates the world, and so even the Buddha is constantly having to deal with Mara."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The Buddha describes many, many times the fact that we can actually know this for ourselves in a way that it makes a qualitative difference to how we are in this world."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Now, again, the unconditioned is a favorite of Buddhists because it seems to bring God back into the picture."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "He's saying unconditioned means to be unconditioned by greed, unconditioned by hatred, unconditioned by delusion."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "The word is actually sila-bhata, which means virtuous conduct and vows."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "In the Sutanipata, verse 231, it just says, you overcome sila-bhata, you overcome virtuous conduct and vows."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "You become free in the sense not of being liberated from something, but you become liberated to do something."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "My disciples, clothed in white, enjoying sensual pleasures, who carry out my instruction, respond to my advice, have gone beyond doubt, become free from perplexity, gained in trepidity, and become independent of others in my teaching."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And Subhada then asks him, you know, how am I to know what teaching that I hear is your teaching? And he says, wherever you find the teaching on the eightfold path, that's his final injunction to this disciple, this new disciple, who he then admits into the order, and shortly after that, probably the next day or so, dies."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "It's ongoing, it's processual, it's open-ended, it's a constant engagement with the world as the world is inevitably changing and shifting and unexpected things are happening."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "But actually, and this is another reason why I feel it's so important to have a good sense of the Buddha's life, is that his life is the teaching on compassion."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "Oh, God, they're a bit tacky."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "And so I'm just, where I'm going with that is, do you feel as though doctrines of that nature are responses, as you described, potentially historical responses, rather than, let's say, call them philosophical outcroppings of what originally happened? Well, actually, I disagree."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "There is no equivalent to the word in Sanskrit, Buddha nature, it means womb of the Tathagata, or more usually, family of the Buddha, Buddha Gautra, not Buddha Swabhava."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "So then we're back to what you said before about basically words being used in not the original fashion, such as Buddha taking words from the Vedantic mindset and altering them."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 4)", "completion": "So it's really a question of differentiation, learning how to, but in order to do that, you need to be clearer about what the early tradition was actually saying."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "That's really much more essential."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So in a number of places when the Buddha talked about the practice of Buddhism, he used a compound word, and the compound word is sati sampajana."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And that was quite fine for me when I was a monk."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But as we can see the places of choice, then we're not so much victims of circumstances, but we can actually have an influence on this causal chain of cause and effect that goes on."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Make sense? So the teaching of karma has to do with a place of choice, the choices we make."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And the story I like to tell is after spending about three years at the Zen monastery, it was a bit surprised for me to leave the monastery and come back to San Francisco to live there."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I had to change by the experience in the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "But one surprise was, I'll say it this way, in the monastery, much of the daily life was choreographed."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And so then I came back to San Francisco where life was not choreographed anymore."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I would say in a sense I was unconscious of the choices I made about how I sit in a chair."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Then if I sat up and kind of really sat there kind of facing them."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And I thought, I wonder if there's choice in falling in love."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Or does action have consequences in the next minute or the next hour or the next day or the next year? What are the consequences of the actions we make? So karma theory has to do with the action and its consequences."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And so if you put a rubber duck in that pond before you throw all those pebbles in, which pebble is affecting the duck? Making it bob up and down."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And they all are in this complicated way in which all these pebbles and the waves are kind of interacting on the surface of the water."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Of the intentions we act on."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And you don't have to attribute that to your karma."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Because it kind of guarantees that the sucker is going to get his due sooner or later."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It's not supposed to explain everything."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "If our intentions are unhealthy, that unhealthy fuel produces more unhealthy."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Some of you could leave here and be angry."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I'm not going to take that with me."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Or then you leave here and you're the subject of whatever cause and effect thing that's happening out there."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And I've known people who actually had to go and make amends after 20 years."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "If I spent the whole day thinking about some of the things I did, at the end of the day, I think I'd feel lousy."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "I don't know if it charges the right word, but they're not necessarily happy memories."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "When we act with fear, fear is in our intention, then it produces certain tension in the body."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Had been kind of at a distance from it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Another way that the track that intentionality works within us is it works within as a conditioning of us."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "We're always defending ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And the habit can become something that sometimes kind of drives us rather than we driving it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So, for example, addictions can be that."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "You know, some people just can't stop talking."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And they grow and they grow and they grow until, you know, it becomes our character almost."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And these things can be conditions for happiness, but it can be kind of fleeting and kind of unstable to have the world be the reason for why we're happy or unhappy."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And that world of happiness that's stable and internal has a lot to do with our intentions."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "So, you know, it creates a situation where it's hard to be happy if you're really worried about your ethical integrity and the effect of it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "It's not about just giving information, right? Because, like, someone stops you in most directions how to get to San Francisco, and you just give them information."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "We're trying to communicate much more than facts and information."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "We're trying to manipulate somehow the situation."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "One of the great supports for the study of intention is your physical body."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Sometimes you can plan ahead and even."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "You know, you're going to do it."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "What's my intention for doing this? And then one of the very significant things to do around intentions is to, on a regular basis, ask yourself, explore for yourself what is the deepest intention that you want your life to be based on? What is the purpose or the motivation that you would like your life to be centered on? And that's an interesting one to do regularly because that can change and morph over time."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And if you keep doing it, you might be able to kind of refine it or take it to deeper and deeper levels."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And what I mean is by the absence of something."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "Some people are completely motivated by fear."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "My intention is to be quick."}
{"prompt": "Karma and Intention", "completion": "And the primary way we do that is by working with our intentions."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "I started with the trees and I learned about all the different oak trees that are here and the area."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And it's like, well, look at that."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And what goes on in the experience is kind of a blur of stuff and, yeah, just relax, relax."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "Or just be open to whatever is here."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "You know, and feel kind of relaxed and open and it can be beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And, you know, and so different things feel differently."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "But there are probably, you know, there could be dozens and dozens here in this room, ideas of what that is."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And as we begin learning the different ways, the different forms, different species of attention, then we have the ability to recognize what we're using at any given time and also have the ability to know what might be useful and shift the kind of attention we have, depending on what's useful."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "It might be that there are, you know, different things that are going on."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "To somehow pull back and just kind of, and just be receptive might pull the plug from all the ways in which we're participating, and that lets something settle."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "I knew I was out in nature."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "I kind of can recognize these things and I really know it."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "There's a little release feeling, a little pushing feeling and just sensing and feeling."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "There's a subtle movement, a separation of the vertebrae, the rib cage, ribs as an inhale."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And they're just kind of vaguely with the experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And to kind of connect to that this amazing manifestation of evolution, amazing manifestation of the natural processes of life, internally is not any different than watching whatever phenomena in the natural world you're watching."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so the idea of recognizing is an active part of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so I clearly comprehend the relationship between what I'm thinking about and how my breathing has shifted."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "To clearly comprehend how that works gives me a lot more wisdom and understanding of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And then people will kind of actually get disconnected from their experience by how they use the mental noting."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "In daily life, that's often needed."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "It's much easier to stay in the present moment because you know the landscape, you know what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "To balance that, there's also ways of practicing which are more receptive or passive."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And so one of the ways of using awareness is to be an observer, to observe, rather than knowing."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "So we have these different choices about how to use awareness."}
{"prompt": "Different Forms of Attention, Part 1", "completion": "And then I think it becomes much more interesting and engaging to do the practice and to figure out how to do the adjustments that are supportive and helpful for the deepening and freeing process that goes on in the practice."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And here was someone who really addressed it directly, and that's a relief."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And the Buddha sometimes is called the happy one."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And some people find it a little bit confusing because they're unhappy."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That kind of penetrates and really presents for us and integrated in some way in us."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So when the Buddha talked about, discussed or described the path of liberation, the practices and the experiences that are part of that, the direct path of liberation, he presented two sets of practices."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And one of those two categories of practice, he describes as bringing about well-being, happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That's why perhaps Sela shouldn't be translated as virtue, because that sounds like something positive that you have and you cultivate."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And if you do those things, or if you don't do those things, actually, if you do the not doing, then you can have the bliss of blamelessness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Dalai Lama started crying to know there was such a society where somehow there's something about the way people think, the way people understand themselves that seems to kind of produce a lot of people who have a lot of self-criticism and feel bad about themselves."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And I haven't talked much, so chances of lying, it's probably pretty small except to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And they know how important it is."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And I've known people who felt that with their speech."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And so I feel so much delight that my speech now has changed."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But it takes a lot of attention to feel that because sometimes the allure of pleasure that's part of it camouflages the stress that comes with being that way."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But what I want to emphasize is that it involves work."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And so these practices of letting go are letting go of how we limit that range, limit the way in which we get caught."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "We don't have a selectivity bias towards sense pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "I've been told by several people that maybe it's true that the Thai government prohibited the monks to teach about contentment because they wanted to keep the economy humming and going."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And it speaks to that there are natural processes in our system that move towards health, psychological health."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "That's not something we do the way it's described, but it's a five-step process that unfolds or grows or evolves in the wake of being present, being here, and not constantly being lost and preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And there's no rain that replenishes it."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It's joy that doesn't depend on winning the California lottery or getting a."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But if we are quieter in the mind, even if it's just for a few seconds, we're quiet in the mind, not so much thoughts, and we're able to soften and relax in the body and feel the body from the inside out."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It might be a subtle vibration in the solar plexus or in the belly or in the cheeks, the face, in the hands."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But if it's done selectively or with blinders on, then we miss the fact that at the same time there are some feelings of well-being and stability."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "Sometimes I've had a hard time getting concentrated."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "But maybe it's something to pay attention to through the framework of some of the feeling, settled, stable, present here."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "So what I'm talking about today is not meant to give you more things to do, but more of what I hope is that kind of not exactly doing, but more to be open to or to be aware of maybe what you haven't been noticing yet."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "It's a remarkable body we have, a remarkable body, mind and heart."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "And I know that what I'm talking about today can be difficult at times for anyone."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Wellbeing", "completion": "what has to happen for you in your processes, you have to really, for the first time maybe ever, really give up and suffer really well and not try to fight it or run away from it."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But at the end of that discussion, I said, okay, so, but when you say awareness of awareness, are you talking about, what are you talking about there? And he looked for a little, I said, I think I mostly mean awareness of mindfulness, being aware that we're mindful."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so this is in that terrain right now."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so there is this some this knowing function that's happening in our mind."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "It's like, I had zero memory of passing my turn, zero memory of even being on a road."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And you know, it's like, oh yeah, you know, it didn't remember that."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So mindfulness was not there."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But here I was sitting at this stoplight."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "Mindfulness was not there."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "It is a mental formation that arises that's got a special property to be able to be aware of the mental formations and consciousness and perception that is arising."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So that was a little bit of a kind of a detour from the main topic but seemed like it would fit in at this point in the conversation."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "We need to learn something about the skills of the game."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And some awareness of what's going on around us to track, you know, the people, what's going on, where the ball is, mindfulness needs to be there to track that."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And that's when the kind of the knowledge of begins to kind of be more intuitive in a way, we could say."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "First of all, that this is questioned, that the fornable truths is one of the definitions for what, you know, the wisdom of the Buddha kind of represents."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But the confidence needs, I think part of the wonderful things about the Buddhist practice is that the teaching both includes this kind of framing of how the mind works."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And having confidence in that doesn't seem to do much for us."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But the tools that he offered us, this is the place for me where we need to gain some kind of confidence that yes, I can do this."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "I mean, and in my experience, my first experience, my first kind of sense of that confidence was not so much confidence in the description of the Buddha gave of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So that was enough to give me just a little bit of confidence to say, okay, I'll give it a try."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So that can be, so I think these faculties, there's a way in which they reinforce each other."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "You actually don't need a tremendous amount of confidence to begin."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "I don't get quite how observing anger is going to help me out, but let's see."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "We have to remember, yes, the Buddha said that when this is arising, I'm supposed to orient to being aware of what it's like for that to be happening."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The perspective of wisdom is coming in to help us with that."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So that it's not just simply awareness in the abstract, it is aware of experience as human experience in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And the next like thoughts were, I'm going to keep doing this."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "Sometimes wisdom is strong, and sometimes conditions happen that delusion like charges back in and wisdom is obscured."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "Drawing on that, that knowledge from my own experience."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So, so, you know, when, when it, when the wisdom is a little less strong, we need to engage a little bit more."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "You know, that can affect how, how the experience feels."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "It's really great, actually."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "When wisdom gets really strong, when the wisdom is, you know, when wisdom and energy both are strong, the kind of sense of the Dharma energy being there, then it often, the experience is that it doesn't take the personal effort to engage."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "But there's still energy happening."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "That's usually when mindfulness is either when the wisdom is a little weak and we have to kind of engage, or it feels like it's work because we're not aware that the wisdom is actually strong enough to be."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "The whole pattern of reactivity falls apart just with mindfulness, witnessing it."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "So that that that that experience of the separation is that he said is the mind is interested in the wisdom is interested in understanding that there's a difference between the object and the awareness there."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And the the wisdom, there's many different ways the mind is interested in that the wisdom is interested in exploring experience and three of the key ways it's interested in exploring the experience is impermanent, unreliable, not self."}
{"prompt": "Awareness as the Five Faculties Working Together", "completion": "And so that's that's I think it's it's it's helpful at least for me when I when I stumbled into these two different ways, you know, it's like there's probably many more ways that it can feel when the the mind is balanced and not reactive and fully aware."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "There's compassion that is being met, and then our conditioning comes in somehow, some way."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "Many in our community, we started calling coronavirus COVID-19 the Rona, especially within our Dharma circles, because we understood Rona as a teacher."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "It goes very deep and wide and spaciously into how we educate ourselves to be more compassionate."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "And so this reminds us of the Pali word, Pali being the language of the written text of the Buddha Dharma, the Buddhist teachings in Pali."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "Many of you have heard it translated as such as mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "Many of us are engaged in the world."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "For some, during this pandemic, we have learned folks who have been deeply engaged in the world for generations and generations."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "This is how we begin to remember in the moment or we come into relationship with understanding the heart body as wisdom, just as we understand sleepiness as wisdom, as compassion, as a place of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "And I am of the deep belief this is to my own practice and what I've seen in my teachers and my elders, for example, and even the youth."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "The heart may be bumping up against something."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "I can go into a million different things and go into a million different stories of how we may be othering, pushing away this separation piece."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "So what actually may be happening is within this realm of what some of us are calling like these far and near energies that are either opposites of compassion or masquerading as compassion."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "It doesn't need much investigation."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "But that type of sound, that type of reactivity in that horn, we're known with that."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "We're talking about true interconnected compassion, honoring everything, all things, the foundation of everything as love."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "To be of service as best we are able in the world for others on behalf of others."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "They're very, very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "It's a well-known principle in all meditation traditions that a moment's insight into the pain and present is far more beneficial than viewing the present moment with disgust and placing one's hopes on a better future."}
{"prompt": "Compassion", "completion": "And this is, again, this is an embodiment of practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "Draw a line around certain phenomena."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "You know, kind of zonked out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "Something is happening even as it seems like nothing's happening or it's useless."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "Yeah, you don't, don't know what's going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "Interviews, no practice discussions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "Yeah, and just, just, uh, yeah, staying close in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "And so just to notice how it is for you."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "It could be inside the house."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "It feels, it feels really right."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "And it's also a support for having continuity of mindfulness through the day."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "And then the walks are kind of like a break and, you know, get everything done, you have to get done and then scramble to get back for the sitting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radical Permission to Arrive", "completion": "So it's like, what is it for you to keep that heat of mindfulness, heat of awareness, of attention going? You know, so it can be a very helpful thing to do to take a sit, a walk and a sit and say, I'm going to treat this as one whole thing, you know, and see how, how, how much continuity of mindfulness is possible to maintain."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "It is visible here and now."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And so today it's the idea that it's immediate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "It, probably a little bit more literal meaning is rather than timeless is not of time in the sense of being immediate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And this ability to really be in the present, not to, not in a static present, but the dynamic present, that's how it's immediate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "So that's how it's not of time, because the immediate flow in the moment, it takes, it takes time, takes a little more different, more complicated or active activity of the mind to have a sense of the past and the future and to bring it into the present, but the present by itself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "But what do I find even more interesting about this, you know, Akaliko, this immediacy, the immediacy of now, the present moment, is that the human sense of how long the present moment is variable."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And, and so there's a, it's somewhat subjective, this experience of what is the present moment, how long is it, how long is it extended."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "It's the faster the reactivity, the impulsive reactivity, the you know, the shorter the moment is."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And when there's a very short moment, like rapidity of things, we might not even be aware of time, or the timeless present."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And maybe that's one of the reasons why these emotions began for human beings evolutionarily."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "But when they're chronic in us and always there, it kind of leads to kind of stress and kind of a rapidity and a fast mind and a spinning mind, and probably a kind of tendency to create a lot of cortisol, maybe even adrenaline, stress in the body, stress systems in the body, stress hormones."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "And so qualities like generosity and love and kindness and friendliness, these feelings belong to the world of extended time, where there isn't the rapidity."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (2 of 5) Immediate", "completion": "You know, if you're playing ping-pong, stop playing, or the equivalent, stop doing it and sit down and let there be an extended pause, maybe as you have a cup of tea or something, and see what's available to you that's different than in the rapidity of some of the things that we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Sometimes I think too that our capacity to be balanced is cultivated."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "We hit those challenges and we learn how to, with our practice, we learn how to open to those challenges."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And owning that, really acknowledging that is a great step, actually, to ease and peace in our own hearts."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "It's, and it may not be pretty."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "Not to indulge in it, but to be curious about what happens."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And that's, that's not that doesn't have to be motivated that action doesn't have to be motivated out of reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "So it feels like there's a lot that can be followed or threads that could be followed out of many pieces of this."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "It's like it's a container."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And it we don't have to be afraid of it anymore."}
{"prompt": "Sudden and Surprising Reactivity", "completion": "And yeah, yeah, very, very helpful."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And I always like to hear the announcements about the community."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And then started doing a lot of retreats."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And one perspective is that actually the out of accordance is a certain friction which could be described as dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "It's important during the official meditation period, of course, and to have a meditation practice."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "That which you think and ponder upon frequently, that will become the inclination of your mind."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So it's kind of common sense, and yet what does that actually mean if we take that to be true? What does that actually mean? So I like to create a metaphor of considering physical training."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "But it seems like over the years and maybe in the 70s, 80s, sort of become more popular an idea that actually physical training is good for all of us."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And different kinds of muscle groups and so on."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And he said, you know, if you're nervous before a game, can you just go sit in the locker room quietly by yourself and bring your attention to your breathing."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So I thought, wow, that would have been much more fun, like, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So, okay, now I'll turn to the part two, the Dharma of big box stories."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So, you know, Costco is like a whole different experience, and using this, this talk is not sponsored by Costco."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And it was different, you know, I noticed this like overwhelming experience."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So actually not allowing the attention to be distracted by a certain of the sense stores, including sight, perhaps sound, right."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "It's supposed to be on the leash."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And then you can take it even further with, you know, the training of the mind, like it's actually possible to cultivate a sense of kindness, a sense of well-wishing to all the other beings in the store."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And last season, the Cal Women's Basketball Team did quite well."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And then you can be curious about various minute aspects of practicing a certain thing over and go."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And it transforms the experience of practicing into a practice."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So also within the kind of Buddhist psychology, there's really interesting, if you're interested in this kind of thing, you know, articulation of all these different qualities of mind that are there, which are very subtle little ones, which I think are always being cultivated in different things that we do."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Not necessarily, like, maybe well to random people out loud, but, I mean, say hi to somebody, and that's really, does generate goodwill all around."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And this is counter to a lot of like American ideas of like freedom means being able to do it like whatever the heck you want, like all the time."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, you have to be responsible about it."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "I'm switching over from this."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Did you do it by doing noticing what was happening in your body and also the emotions as opposed to the story? Okay."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "In that case, it was more just the attention and it happens sort of automatically now, sort of our training."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And so there's actually a wide variety of strategies that can be used."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Another, for different states of mind, is actually to cultivate the opposite, you know, to specifically cultivate whatever the opposite is of that state."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "It's like, ooh, like, you know, like, wow, that's icky, you know, like dead squirrel necklace, that's, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "Like, let me see that, get interested in it."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "You know, surprisingly large amounts of time, even just in between times, when you are walking to the bathroom, when you are standing in line for food, you know, this and that."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "And just of taking that as mind training, you know."}
{"prompt": "Training the Mind in Daily Life", "completion": "So whatever you think and ponder upon frequently, this will become the inclination of your mind."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "A friend of mine stood up and said, you know, Joseph, ten years ago I heard you talk and I asked you to summarize the practice in one sentence."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And the truth is we don't even really have a choice but to love."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Over time, the kind of pain of that, we acclimatize to that."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And so I feel like we actually as a country have this very precarious sense of who we are, of national self-esteem, and it's made precarious by our failure to fully own the devastation of history and the continued suffering that's disproportionately experienced by people in the country."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "I'm such a long way in, I see no way through and no space."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "I don't have much knowledge yet in grief, so this massive darkness makes me small."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "There are different ways of thinking about grieving in the Buddhist tradition."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "It shortens the trace of them."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "It seems fair to conclude that human beings are fundamentally and pervasively motivated by a need to belong."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "If psychology has erred with regard to the need to belong, the error has been to under-appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "The mind quite naturally defaults to the assumption of permanence."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Just to a certain kind of assumption of permanence."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And at times our strategies work and there's a sense of like some relief from the relentlessness of it."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And I don't want to make light of the ways that denial and all of this functions."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Maybe this is the function of Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "And it's a love that's bigger than the person-object idea where it had been contained, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "Yeah, and it's like we try like all our Dharma karate moves on some form of suffering, you know."}
{"prompt": "Grief", "completion": "But this is a preparation for so much."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "The topic that I thought of reflecting on this morning is the topic of refuge."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "The teachings of the Buddha are so deep and profound, and they, they really touch our experience of dukkha, you know, this, the suffering, the experience of unreliability, that's another word for dukkha, the suffering, the stress, the dissatisfactor, the unsatisfactory nature of, of experience, that this is really what, what the teachings touch and point to, and so it's a beautiful time for us with this being so obvious to, to ask, you know, what kind of medicine does the Buddha have to offer for this, and it's, it's powerful medicine, but it's also, maybe it's kind of hard to take sometimes, the medicine of the Buddha, it's, it's, it's very counterintuitive, it's not what our minds would normally orient to in terms of, how can I find safety? With unreliability, what we think of as how can we find something that's reliable, you know, how can we land on something, how can we control things? And in, in some ways, what the Buddha pointed to as refuge is coming into alignment with this very nature of experience being impermanent, unreliable, and uncontrollable."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And how, how does this possible? The, the, the possibility of coming into alignment with these truths, coming into alignment with this impermanent, unreliable nature."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And he, he was a human being."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "You know, he wasn't some God, you know, he was a human being."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "That's one way to understand what happened for him because he did, he did explore kind of transcendent practices of, of deep states of Jhana and kind of, you know, almost like in some of those states, you kind of separate from reality."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Okay, take something to do myself, to get away from it in order to feel okay for a period of time, but it doesn't solve the problems that I'm looking for."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "That's like, that's like the capacity of awareness showing itself to you."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "It's just like, I would, I was telling myself, you know, I can't do this practice."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "I'm, I'm not able to, to, to be aware."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Not simply awareness in and of itself, you know, just being awake to whatever is happening with our usual habitual ways of relating to the world, even that being aware may kind of be infused with our habitual ways of being in the world, wanting to get things that we like, wanting to get rid of things that we don't like."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And so the, the Dharma begins to infuse that capacity for awareness with some wisdom, with some understanding of how to be aware, so that the mind can begin to come into alignment with these truths."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "The Buddha met a wanderer, Vihiya."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "In the cognized is only the cognized."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "What's it like to feel anger in the present moment? What is this experience? So this is, again, pointing to the human nature, the lived human experience."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "Dharma, the word Dharma actually translates pretty literally as nature."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "So there's not any reliability in this changing experience."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "It's a recipe for loss when we lose something we had that we wanted, that we liked, and it goes away."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And then they fall apart and we feel betrayed by the world or we feel like we've made some mistake or we've blown it, we failed."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And then the refuge becomes something more like available internally."}
{"prompt": "Refuge", "completion": "And I've been so inspired by some of those people."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So the five hindrances are the narrow description of them."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So for mindfulness students, it's very important to study these and get to know them well so that they lose their power to hinder."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Often people's attitude towards them is that they shouldn't be there, they're unfortunate and people like to get over them very quickly."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "He asked me what I wanted to do with my life or what I wanted to do with something."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "I wanted to learn farming."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And I probably had other things I wanted to do."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "You can desire well-being for your family, your neighbors, your world."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "But constant wanting of stuff was exhausting."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Isn't that something? So because we're so kind of enamored with that thing that we want to have."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So, you know, pursuing girls, I guess, you know, has some kind of desire and hopefully a nice outcome."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Or then the same on the same time, meeting a girl, following her home to where she lived on the street."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So my friend and I, one of us took that went from the front of the phone book and the other one went from the back of the phone book and we called everyone who lived on that street asking for her."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "So I'm sure none of you have been that, you know, fanatical about pursuing desires."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Sometimes the pursuit of desire can be alienating."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And whatever your philosophy might be around desire, some people want to quick to justify it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "One way to deal with it is to redouble our commitment or effort to stay with meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "What is it the thing you want? And is it really cut out to be what you think it is? Is it really that desirable? Or what are the disadvantages of the thing that you're desiring? It can be very unpopular to tell someone, you should spend some time looking at the undesirable aspects of what you desire."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Or, you know, imagine, you know, like their bodies split open."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "How is it that there's a sense of lack that might be there in the pursuit of any kind of desire? And I think addiction often has that quality that there's some kind of discomfort, some kind of lack, some kind of something."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "To mention just one that's often mentioned, I think, often enough, is sometimes men refusing to wear condoms because it decreases their pleasure."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And some people are addicted to or really pulled into the pleasure that can come from the mind as much as the pleasure can come from the body."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And then it's easy to let go of the wasa crackers because the cream puff is so sweet and wow."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And so it's interesting, so people often associate sometimes Buddhism with renunciation, which means, oh, you have to let go of all the stuff."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "I think there's something a lot better."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And then time, this greater sense of well-being can arise."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "Because I don't know what you're talking about."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "You know, I want something."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "They want something from that person."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "That person might be it might be impossible for that person to provide it or the person might be completely unwilling."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And so rather than disadvantage of the object, what we want, we might look at the disadvantage of the pursuit."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Sensual Desire", "completion": "And if people really understood these other strong motivating forces that where the means doesn't have to justify the ends, but where the means, the end doesn't have to justify the means, but where the means is just so beautiful in itself, then maybe it doesn't matter if we reach the end."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Big Mind", "completion": "The meditation will end with three consecutive bells."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "One of the most simple and useful teachings of the Buddha was what is called the teaching of the arrow, or the two arrows."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "And similarly the Buddha pointed out that the first arrow is non-negotiable."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "It's uncomfortable, but the suffering, the dukkha, is what the mind adds to it."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "So the teaching of the Four Noble Truths, the dukkha that we talk about, the suffering that we talk about being brought to an end, is that the suffering of the second arrow."}
{"prompt": "Afternoon Talk: The Second Arrow", "completion": "And so the usual encouragement around sitting meditation that our teacher Ajahn Chah would give would be to say when you feel pain in the body and you want to change your posture and always stay with it for a few minutes before you shift your posture."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (3/5) The Importance of Insight into Impermanence", "completion": "Even perhaps maybe I would venture to say even more important than the one we discussed yesterday, which already seemed, wow, this is important."}

{"prompt": "The Past Has Been Left Behind, The Future Has Not Been Reached", "completion": "It's natural that we start thinking forward."}
{"prompt": "The Past Has Been Left Behind, The Future Has Not Been Reached", "completion": "So one of the ways that he talked about it was in how we walk our path, you know, our tendency to have goals or decide that we want certain things or that we want to let go of certain things that were quote unquote working on certain things as we see in our mind that we want to change them."}
{"prompt": "The Past Has Been Left Behind, The Future Has Not Been Reached", "completion": "And some of us may have experience with things happening that are not what we could have imagined."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (3 of 5) Craving and Aspiration", "completion": "So to begin noticing a difference between craving and aspiration and noticing a different way in which it affects you, physically, emotionally and conscious-wise, how does it switch and change the sense of being aware depending on which one you're operating from? One of the things that I believe is often the case is that with craving, there's often a feeling of discontent."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (3 of 5) Craving and Aspiration", "completion": "There's space and room for inputs, for things to arise and be there and feel more deeply what's going on in this world."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Yeah, because, you know, we're all fallible."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Yeah, I'd qualify it by saying almost like revealed truths."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "You know, it's pretty bad stuff that's going on in the vinaya."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "But in there, in one time, I mean, there's one very indicative statement I find in the vinaya when the Buddha says to Ananda, he says, Ananda, why aren't things better in the old days? You know, it's almost sort of kind of retrospective saying, when it was simpler, when we had less people, when we didn't have these monasteries to run and things like that, it was a lot better."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "A quick question or a really calm comment and then a question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "You kicked off today by saying you're kind of stripping away kind of the extraneous religious components that have been kind of built up over time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So actually entering into a renouncer tradition was a way of creating time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now colonialism had some good points as well as bad points."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "They were either subsistence economies such as China and Tibet."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "They weren't just meditation halls and things like that."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Or you can ignore that and just go for the traditions."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Because actually when you look at all these traditional forms of Buddhism what you find are heavily, heavily inculturated aspects of Buddhist thought."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It's really difficult to pull the Buddhism out of the culture, in that sense."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Again, I'm sorry, I've always given long answers to short questions though."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It doesn't mean you don't have those desires any longer, it just means you can examine them more closely or there's less opportunity if you're trying to live the veneer to immediately want to satisfy the desires that you have, whether they be for sex or money or whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Certainly by the time we get to a number of the links, from feeling, craving, to grasping, we're into the real kernel of the problem that you and I and everybody suffer from."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "The Buddha, again, with his primacy on the direct experience of things, is talking about what we can actually experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now, again, this is conjecture, I can't prove it, but just these slight anomalies, when you've got the so-called great teaching on dependent origination, yet it doesn't include two of the most important links of the chain."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "And the Buddha goes, Ananda, think again."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "When you've kind of harvested corn, and you collect them in bundles, and then you stack them by placing them against each other, so the weight leans into each, and they self-support each other."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "And actually, the landscape is life, and the confused inhabitants are probably your parents."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Because all they're trying to do is give you their confusion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It's not that I just don't know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So there was things flowing in."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Why keep it to yourself? So that's part of what we're spreading around."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "His comment on this was, when I heard him speaking once, was he said, the only thing I know that has kankas is dog's ears and roses."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Because it affects all of our relations with the world."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It affects all of our relations with the world."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now, this is, in a sense, the asava that deeply craves sensuality."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "This is really deep stuff."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "In fact, again the Buddha is playing on this because there's a very famous quote in the Brihadaranyaka, which is known as the Gyatrimantra, which is, from death take me to immortality."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "The reason I want to do that is because I want to contrast opinion with knowledge and insight into the way things are."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "There was no death, there was no rebirth, there was only having a good time."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "They were nihilists, basically."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now, all of these are born out of pappancha."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So, this is kind of, everything's misplaced here, isn't it? Can you see this? The confusion is actually we're misplacing any search that we might have."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now, in many ways, what you can see is that, in the early text, what the Buddha is trying to really give us a picture of, is that we're not bad people."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now, in the later part of the wheel, you're going to find the bhava, which actually means the desire not to continue."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "The desire to obliterate yourself in some way or another."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So I developed my sense of the world by having lots of views and opinions about it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It looks fairly similar to the one that's being molded, but it's got a big wonkiness in the top."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "And so it's like the process of what we engage in is molding and remolding often our habits."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Our proclivities to behave and think in certain ways."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "This is very much the creation of the kind of neural pathways that we're engaged in."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So Sankaras, we're always setting up Sankaras and operating out of the Sankaras."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So this is really the way that the Buddha is describing the setting up of the Sankaras."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It's like the painter can only paint one subject."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Like you somehow lost a bit of yourself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So there's often this deep, deep sense, almost a grief when you've lost a habit."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "Now I'm going to say a bit more about them tomorrow because they're really, really important, although they're not in the list that's given in the Mahandana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "All these different terms you get where Kamma is involved is this kind of recycling of this desire that we have, that we're deeply, deeply enmeshed into."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "It's understanding that pathology and then about how to eliminate that pathology."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 4", "completion": "So what we're actually engaged in is beginning to slow down the process, beginning to see a lot more clearly, and then when we begin to see more clearly, we know when we can intervene."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "But thank you for those of you who are sending something to me."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "There are reasons why we are feeling some ease or some freedom, and there's reasons why we might not be feeling that, why we might have non-ease, non-freedom, non-contentment."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "That simplicity supports a greater sense of ease and contentment, and I'm assuming that this might be obvious for some of you."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "So in some ways, I think many of us have this experience to keep our surroundings with not too much clutter or disorganization."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "So one of the ways in which to kind of keep this things in a straightforward way, an uncomplicated way, is just as I was pointing to, is mindfulness of the body."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "Maybe not too busy or not too much multi-tasking, whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "And recognizing when there's Pappancha, this proliferation of thought."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "Conceived out of nowhere, but in this place, beginning to lead you to a place where you can find your way."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "Conceived out of nowhere, but in this place, beginning to lead everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "What is happening here? What's going on? And the questions and requests to stop what we're doing, to stop the becoming that we're doing in such a way that sometimes a lot of the complications that we introduce into our experience are just a way to bolster or protect or augment a sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "Sometimes, if you move carefully through the forest, breathing like the ones in the old stories who could cross a shimmering bed of leaves without a sound, you come to a place whose only task is to trouble you with tiny but frightening requests."}
{"prompt": "Simplicity", "completion": "Conceived out of nowhere, but in this place beginning to lead everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "So there were various ways in which activity unfolds with things that happen, theories about it the Buddha was critical of."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And so it's very interesting, the Buddha says, don't look at the self as being ultimately responsible, don't look at others, don't blame others, but also don't blame yourself."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And she spent years, kind of racked with guilt and feeling that, oh, I could have done something, I could have done something, it was really burdened for her."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "But as a 14 year old, you know, that was not something in her domain to be able to figure out what to do."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Something happens to you, and the person says, you know, it's my karma."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Some of it relates to this idea of karma."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And that evening there was a kind of a party in the back of the apartment complex and some grown up took that pole and tried to use it a pole vault over a fence, a low fence."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And I used to think about things like, well, if I'm walking down the street and I ask someone for the time of day, it takes the person two seconds to offer me the time of day."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And pretty soon, it gets very complicated."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And he defined, what I call karma is intention."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "So there are lots of things we do that have no particular intention, things like activities."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And everything else, that person's life changes forever in some way or other."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "There's an external kind of cause and effect relationship that gets formed."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "And we could say in our psychologicalized West that it's a psychological effect that happens."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Something happens internally with us."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Sometimes it's self-reinforcing our views."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "The person still would have, legally the other person would have been responsible and I wouldn't have gotten out of my car and said, oh, let me tell you about my karmic responsibility here, but, but karmically, my, I wouldn't, I also wouldn't say that, I wouldn't necessarily say that my karm, my intentionality caused the accident."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Because I was kind of pushing the gas pedal, I was maybe creating a little bit of tension in my shoulders, and because of the tension in my shoulders, that exasperated a lifetime of tension in my shoulders, and pretty soon my upper back goes out, and, and the upper back goes out not because of necessarily having a bad back, but because perhaps a lifetime of this intentionality of how I hold myself in relationship to the world, or, or it reinforces the fact that I, it's okay to kind of drive a little bit fast, and so I do it again with the same kind of mindset, and it's that mindset that gets reinforced, that mindset that creates unhealthy conditions that are going to somehow or other come into play or blossom into the future, but we have no idea how they're going to blossom."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "I left the theater, right? So there's no more particular way of being."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "Because of my three years of being in theater, I saw that I had much more choice in simple things like how I sat in that chair than I saw before I went to the monastery."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Yeah, I find myself smiling."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Just in case there happens to be a pandemic, just in case there happens to be really awful racial injustice, just in case there happens to be some economic uncertainty, it's good to have a practice that can support us and help us."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And Kali, the maid, she thought, you know, my boss, my mistress, has a good reputation."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? That is, am I just helping to create all the perfect conditions so that she never has to show any anger? Is it just because she has all of us that are running this household working here that are putting things just so? But when things aren't just so, how is."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "I have in my mind Mistress Videhika."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So she woke up late the next day."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "But then the maid gets this inkling, well, maybe she's not quite so calm and even tempered."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And Videhika says, hey, Kali! Yes, ma'am."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "I'm coughing, not because I'm sick, just because I'm speaking."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And then the Buddha continues with some more instructions."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "The same phrase, my heart will not be warped, could also be translated as my mind will not be affected."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "My heart will not be warped."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "These things don't get affected by the difficulties that are happening even if somebody is trying to heat them up, trying to get a rise out of them in some way like how the maid was trying to get a rise out of Mr."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So what does it mean to be deep and immense or deep and immeasurable? So there's a few things that we could look at or we can talk about."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "For me, at least quite naturally, there's a kind of a deeper breath that can happen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "Allowing a relaxation of the stomach, the abdomen, middle and lower back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "And then maybe too, there's a possibility of also relaxing inside the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "Maybe it supported a softening of the body, but maybe also it's affected the mind a little bit sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "For some of you, it may be helpful to specifically connect with the experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "These are simply different ways into connecting with your experience."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "It can be very supportive for us."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxation and Ease", "completion": "That sense of what it's like in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "But what do we say? How do we understand this? There was an earthquake in Haiti last summer and that was such a clear event that through the YouTube channel in the house here at IMC, we raised over $30,000 to dedicate to a wonderful nonprofit, partners in health."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "So unknown how this is evolving and what's going to be needed and what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "Do you know what to say? I could offer opinions, but you're not here for my opinions."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "One of the definitions for evil, a word which I seldom use, but many Buddhist texts and English translations of the suttas use the word evil as if it's there in the suttas."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "And when we're not connected deeply to ourselves, then it's our surface reactivity which gets the upper hand."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "And it felt like, you know, it was hopeless unless I kind of used my strong voice."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "But sometimes I use a strong voice which was done consciously, carefully, because I didn't know what else to do."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "And like, you have to stop what you're doing and you cannot do that anymore."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "So in Buddhism, there's a very strong, in the teachings of the Buddha, a very strong repeated emphasis on non-harming, non-violence, on not killing."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "He does say that you can strike back, if someone attacks you, in order to escape."}
{"prompt": "Practicing The Dharma In The Context of Ukraine", "completion": "But there is this radical, strong idea of non-violence."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Right then what Ajahn's Tomatoes is describing, and the emphasis on awareness, it is pointing to the very fact that the island that you cannot go beyond is pointing to the quality of awareness itself."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Is it synonymous with mind or is it something, an aspect of mind? It's printed all over the book and in your teachings and everybody's teaching."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Sometimes people will say mind as if it has a capital M which is meant to be a similarly all encompassing quality."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so mind or mano often is referring just to the conditioned aspects of mental activity."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But it's all just vernacular really because in terms of that there is a very close mapping."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "So the word for momentary is tadangana and so they talk about momentary liberation, tadangana vimuti or tadangana nibbana and to me that's a totally valid quality."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "And so it tries to threaten the Buddha that he's going to leave him if the Buddha doesn't answer the questions."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Even the more sophisticated view that nibbana is merely the destruction of defilements and the extinction of existence cannot stand up under scrutiny."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "Probably the most compelling testimony against that view is the well-known passage from the Udana that declares, with reference to nibbana, that, quote, there is an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "You know, I'm a monk, or I'm an IT executive, or I'm a yogi."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "But then we forget that this is just fabricated."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "If you're not attached to the moods or not attached to the body, then the body can be born and age and die, or moods can come and go, projects can come and go, events can come and go, but if the heart's not tied to them, then there's no quality of burdenness or disappointment associated with that."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "I think that while you were saying that, I was thinking of this, an android called Theta, which was very popular in Star Trek, and he was someone who would fit into your pattern quite well, because he realized all the logical inroads and outroads of all the things you were saying, but he didn't really get upset about it, and he was able to function even in the presence of great emotions both ways."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "He was feeling compassion for their suffering and their difficulty, but he wasn't getting wrapped up in it, and so you try and sort of pin down the expression on his face, and you couldn't quite pin it down, and you realize you can't pin it down as a concept, but when we are fully open-hearted in that way, then we both experience that strength of feeling that goes with the moment, both the rejoicing or the sadness that it's there, and we also experience the kind of absurdity of it, and also the naturalness of it, that how painful that we get caught up in such things and get carried away on how utterly human it is to be so completely involved, it's like this."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 1)", "completion": "There's really beyond words, and so that's why having a study day on Nibbana is tricky, because it's pointing to a wordless quality of achievement that enables us to respond to life in different ways."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "What kind of issues do you bring up in your mind and when you bring them up, what comments do you make? What questions do you ask yourself about things? This is going to have an impact not only on the way you speak but also on the way you sense things and the state of your mind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "He said, maybe you can change something in the way you breathe, maybe you can change something in the way you talk to yourself about it, or maybe you can change the way you perceive the situation or feel about the situation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "A neurotic knows that 2 plus 2 equals 4, but hates them for it."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The Buddha has a lot also in the issue of grief when you are about to lose somebody or you've already lost somebody."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "First, you have to ask yourself, how am I breathing when this attack of grief comes on? What's my breath like? Can I breathe in a way that's not adding more trouble, more suffering? As the Buddha said all too often, we're like a person who's been shot by one arrow and it's not bad enough we shoot ourselves with a second arrow."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "The Buddha, instead of saying, I'm really sorry for you, I have my condolences."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "I have a certain identity and my identity is being fed by my relationship with this person."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So what can you do to help this person not worry about things they're leaving behind and not worry about where they're going? Try to do everything you can to put that person's mind at ease."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "That's why she was getting you not to worry about these things."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Part of the mind will say, hey, these feelings are natural, these feelings are my real feelings, this is what I really feel."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And this is why the act of fabrication is not getting in the way of insight."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And so you want to be able to see that in action."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So this is, in addition to equanimity, you find that sometimes you actually need to, as the Buddha says, exert a fabrication, change the way you breathe, change the way you think or thinking about things, the topics you bring up, change the way you perceive and feel things."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Alertness is watching what's happening, but mindfulness reminds you that there are duties that you have with regard to whatever is coming up."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Watching with, but as I said, equanimity itself is a fabricated state."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And then Ananda says, well, how can you hit that without clinging? And he says, you have to look at how you're reacting to the equanimity right there."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So equanimity is not nirvana."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Please erase that from your memory."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "There's no place where he says it's the highest equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "But the happiness here is not a feeling."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "That's actually where we're aiming."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "If you perceive yourself simply as a victim, that is going to create certain limitations on how you can respond."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "Where can I change this? The element of control here."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And to just go around the situation."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "But in the meantime, how am I going to maintain my inner strength and well-being so I can address it in the most effective way? So the first issue I would say here is look at how much you're suffering from this and when the mind calms down, then you can look at the situation outside and see what can be changed there."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "And then once you've got the abdomen in this stuff, so it's sort of the front of the torso comfortable."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "We talk about breath, it's not just air."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "You're not going to pump air in the back of your neck."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So I want to know if there are any specific resources like you want me to refer to."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "It's the absence of suffering of any kind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity is Overrated", "completion": "So you can practice going back and forth until it settles, and you've got both things together."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "Is there ease or tension? Is the mind busy? Aversive or relaxed? Just how are you in this moment? Give yourself permission to be however you are."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "And the torso, a kind of central area of the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "So there's hearing in the breath."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "That moment of that noticing, that's mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: How is This Being, Right Now?", "completion": "Just taking that in, acknowledging that."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "It's meaningful to me that one of the kind of honorific, I think nicknames for the Buddha was the unexcelled trainer of the animal within the human."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Road building is going to reflect our conditioning, our past."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And we want to be conscious of this because how we start to do things in a new way is through awareness."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "So we consider that, okay, you are not meditating."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And we don't have to get this perfect."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "When he's used them as steps to climb beyond them, he must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And then they will see the world aright."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so the question, what supports practicing freedom on this path of freedom? Motivations, intentions, attitudes of mind support us to freely build our road."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so the question is, is Dharma practice, is it intrinsically or extrinsically motivated? Or both? On the one hand, we definitely practice for all kinds of outcomes, right? The rewards for that which is not here now, to develop balance, to reduce anxiety, to grow our hearts, our ethical sensitivity, to perfect our seal, to enhance our equanimity, to let go more and more deeply, to be free, to know ease."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And sometimes you hear the saying, like, the path is the goal, the path is the goal, right? And in this sense, this way of framing practice, we're not going anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "There's another component of humility, which is something like a recognition, a deep recognition of the contributions of others."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so right now it's like we stand on the shoulders of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And that, for me, is the heart of devotion."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And Wes is somebody who, I would say, like very, very closely associates the dharma with, with awe, AWE, awe, the sense of awe."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "But, of course, we can have awe in the face of the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "It's very, it's very humble, but, but there's a lot of confidence."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And at some point he's kind of described like, oh yeah, you're kind of gazing into the, the vast ocean of Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And the question, like, what is the right cadence for assessing your own practice? I don't know if it's true, but the Dalai Lama reportedly said, assess your practice maybe every five or ten years."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "As if we kind of, yeah, we extract something from the Dharma rather than surrender our heart to it."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "And so we know that kind of habit of we take one deep breath and then we kind of pop out and we ask the question, am I more concentrated, yeah? Am I more free? And then we check and it's like, well, I don't know, doesn't seem more free."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "Let me take another breath, right? Now? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "But those self-evaluations, my experience is that they happen very naturally, spontaneously."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "It's just like, ah, a little too tight, a little too loose, and it arises as an insight, very organically."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "The impulse arises, do this, do that, don't do this, make this go away, make this happen, speed that along, slow that down, all of the forces kind of arise and we, um, are willing to absorb the impact, the kind of body blow, mostly in the realm of feeling that comes when we do not act out the dictates of that compulsion."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "It's like, okay, I'm, I'm, maybe I'm happy enough."}
{"prompt": "Tuesday Dharma Talk: Practicing Freely", "completion": "So this opens a kind of a deeper faith in practice that faith propels our practice forward."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Solid, Liquid, Gas", "completion": "And perhaps exploring, putting down all the agendas to make yourself better, to improve your life, to extract something from the moment, putting down the agendas, even of being concentrated, developing freedom."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Solid, Liquid, Gas", "completion": "We do not stand on the banks of the river, Anicca."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "When you ask, it actually is, there is an action going on."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "In other words, there were some beliefs in those times that, one, as I said, action was unreal, or there was some God acting through you that determined everything in your life, or that the consequences were ritualistic."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "So I'd like to go down these four categories, the content, providence, the status as a belief and the motives for believing and sort of take it apart and see exactly what the war on karma is saying."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "The Buddha said that basically the things you see, the fact that you have your senses, the fact that there are things coming into your senses, that's the impact from past karma."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "But it doesn't necessitate that somebody's going to have to kill me."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And he made a huge room for it, as he said, your state of mind right now."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "It's pretty much the same thing."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Just because you've gotten there doesn't mean that you're going to have the right from your karma to stay there for all of your eight years."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Something might happen in the meantime."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "What can I do in order to maintain this? Because the good karma could run out, and then who knows where they're going to fall after they go."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "In other words, he said, people act."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "It's a type of action, and the question is, is it a skillful action? Is it going to create suffering, or is it not going to create suffering? And it turns out his answer there is very interesting."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "If I control the way my life is going to be, I better be careful about what I do."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And you find that makes a lot of sense."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "This place is action within the mind, and it's also a place where you're responsible for what you can do."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "One, there's a statement that Buddhism is not something you believe, it's something that you do."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Well, think about that for a minute."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "If you believe that human action has only limited capabilities, that's going to determine what you do."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "You say, well, effort doesn't make any difference."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Say that you make up your mind."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "The Buddha says, the truth of my words is important."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "That's the kind of proof that the Buddha encouraged."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Finally, the final attack on karma is the attack on the motives for why anybody would want to believe in this."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Now, do you really deserve it at this time? The question is, well, maybe not really."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "It takes actions as the basic unit in life."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And it's very different from saying that you're going to get what you deserve."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "If you want a consoling belief where you don't have to be responsible or where you can be complacent, you want to believe in an outside power."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "Because each action, the law of karma is not a parking law."}
{"prompt": "War on Karma", "completion": "And it's generally a fairly predictable set of causes."}

{"prompt": "Dharma and Depression (week 2)", "completion": "And so, waking up to the fact that it's really a form of betrayal and making the intention, I like that, to, you know, develop more self-loyalty skills, you know, is a beautiful thing."}

{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It's a minimal amount of disturbance."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And he says in the same way, you get a monk to leave the home life, get out of the village, and go into the forest and just reflect on the fact that he's now in the forest and get his mind to focus on that perception of actually the perception they use in terms they use in the Pali, the wilderness, that you're in the wilderness and just focus on the idea of being a wilderness."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And because the slick rock was slippery and monks wear only sandals, and the sandals are pretty useless in a case like that, took off my sandals, put them in a pocket, and so I was barefoot going up the path."}

{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You stay with that long enough, then you focus on the space between the dots, and you realize it's infinite."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And so then he has the meditator follow the same process."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And so again, you look at the disturbance for what it is."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And you realize that too is fabricated."}

{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Is there no self? He refused to answer."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "So can you control this? Okay, I can control that and try to move it into the direction we want to."}

{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "They're meant to lead you to a state where you're looking at things simply in terms of basically the formidable truths."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "This is where the Buddhist teachings always come back to us."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "One is that the type of knowledge we're looking for here is a knowledge that's based on integrity, it's based on honesty, it's based on compassion, comes from realizing the power of our actions, both external actions and internal actions to shape our experience."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And that kind of knowledge, that kind of skill, will take you all the way."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "In fact, that's another place where he defines wisdom is the question, what when I do it will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness? The realization that there's, there is short term happiness, but it's not worth bothering."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "He says, not necessarily, it's not necessarily, okay, if you just get into a state of concentration with that perception."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You say, okay, this is stressful, and it's a very quick kind of internal dialogue, so there is still an element of intention there to drop and move on, drop and move on."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "You're saying that the intention is still to, that it's just, it's more subtle."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "So in order to see it clearly, just keep doing it over and over and over and over and over again and continually."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "Okay, well, just remember yourself."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And if you're too hurried to go into the next door, there's the, the simile of the foolish and experienced cow."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "And she's got grass and she's got water on her little patch there."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "It's also scary sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "First example, you talked about how once you get to a certain stage, you get to a certain stage of concentration and then you should drop the fabrication."}
{"prompt": "Emptiness Revisited", "completion": "I don't turn into a pumpkin, but we're supposed to end at nine o'clock."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation for that is fully aware."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We know we're extending while we're extending our arms."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We know we're speaking while we're speaking."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "This is what it's like to be a human being with this breath arising."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So what leads us to freedom? So the section of the of the Satipatanasuta in the Pali Canon, there's a little like technical detail, but I kind of geek out on these technical details sometimes and think there's something perhaps useful in them."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "These little bracketed sections, Bhikkhu Bodhi didn't make these up."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We can incline in this direction towards not clinging, but non-clinging is really the result, the freeing, the letting go of the practice."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It comes through attending from these perspectives."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And thankfully, Bhikkhu Analyo has done quite a bit of digging for us."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "You know, what's happening with this mind and body, with these five aggregates here, with this bodily process tumbling on, that's the internal exploration."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So that's looking internally at our experience, but we abide observing the body as the body as the body or a body as a body externally, we abide observing feelings as feelings externally."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But in any case, I get to see people, when I take my walks each day for about 30 minutes, I kind of run into people in that, in that realm."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And so, I started kind of being curious, oh, there's a body, there's a body walking across the parking lot."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And yet the power and the beauty of bringing mindful attention that supports moving in the direction of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "Like, it wasn't just about seeing, seeing, seeing."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I don't have the psychic powers."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "You know, that that's actually in our instructions that we wouldn't be looking at people in the meditation hall like that."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So I get to interact with that being."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So just, I want to explore a little, a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We've talked a little bit more and there's kind of a preference in our teaching for talking about the kinds of insights that might arise with internal observation."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But what arises kind of, it's like coming from our conditioning and so that's, you know, that's just unfolding and we also know from our own practice and experience that, you know, how hard it is to meet that with some balance of mind and not act out on this conditioning and not just blurt out something because we're a little frustrated right now."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "The freedom in our own experience comes through the letting go of greed, aversion and delusion internally."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But we can develop an appreciation for this way that we affect each other."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And yeah, we can, you know, imagine perhaps how a seven year old might take it and just the big things, you know, so, you know, we can start with that."}
{"prompt": "Awareness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And some of what you didn't understand may have to do with the conditions of the other person."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Our whole spiritual journey unfolds through the development of this investigative power, this investigation of what is true."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It means the way things are, the way things work, the Tao."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "We can investigate the truth of how things are."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Some years ago I was in New Mexico hiking at the end of a retreat in the wilderness of New Mexico."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "I couldn't put any weight at all on it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "I was going to be teaching in Europe and so my mind just started going down this whole track of judging myself for being so careless that I slipped and why wasn't I paying more attention and then worry about the rest of my summer and my plans and what I was going to do."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "That's kind of get fearful and worried and paranoid and start living in greater contraction."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "For me the acknowledgement of that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Let me just be in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "We see it in climate changes, in weather changes."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Whether we're looking on a more macroscale or on a very microscopic scale, everything is in change."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It's really wonderful to walk through the woods."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And yet now all that's left are these walls in the woods."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And it showed me just how deeply ingrained is both our attachment to the body and our not wanting to see just the truth of how things are."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "I'd like to read you something."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It can bring us to a place of profound wisdom, of profound letting go."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Ajahn Chahu was one of the great Thai forest masters of the last century."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "This is a very profound and difficult practice because we may want to be compassionate and even often are compassionate, but it's not always a very easy thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "In the face of something unpleasant, in the face of suffering, our own, our others, very often, oh, is there some way to be protected from it? Behind all of these movements of pulling away from suffering, and so capping the wellspring of compassion, because compassion comes when we are willing to come close to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "It might be fear, our edge, our boundary, might be fear of certain emotional states, painful emotional states, loneliness or unworthiness."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And it was just such an interesting comment and so resonant with so much of our experience where we get angry or some other emotion in order not to feel the fear or in order not to feel something else."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "This moving away from certain emotions had another very striking experience of it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "And it was just this amazing gift."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "So when we do come to the edge, come to the boundary of something that we're a little uncomfortable with and fear arises, so then the mind can contract in response to the fear."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "The more we can be with our own difficulty, our own pain, the easier it is to be with the pain and difficulties of others."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "So as we develop this motivation more and more in our lives, it really starts to manifest as an active engagement with the suffering in the world."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "You know what's so remarkable about somebody like His Holiness is that when you meet Him, you do feel like you're an old friend because He is so open-hearted and so present and so fully giving of His attention in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "There's this wonderful book by Tracy Ketter called Mountains Beyond Mountains and it's about Paul Farmer."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "So sometimes this compassion manifest is just this tremendous determination and sometimes it manifests in acts of tremendous courage."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "Or we think of the Buddha who practiced over countless lifetimes not only to alleviate the suffering in particular situations but to really penetrate or see what the root causes of suffering were."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom and Compassion", "completion": "To start small, we may be just planting the seed I would like to have the aspiration for that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "But the mind's ability to know what we're concerned about, to be aware of what we're concerned about, can seem kind of incidental or not really to the point."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "Welcome it so that we don't prevent its natural process, don't prevent the healing that might occur if it's given space and time."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "Because when you're the welcomer, you're actually kind of, I don't know if you're in charge, but if you're the welcomer, you've taken a certain kind of place of being independent, or taking the initiative, and you're showing up in a way that, you know, you're not the victim of circumstances, you're not the victim of what's difficult."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "You're just saying, come here and sit here with me, and we'll have a chat."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Welcome Everything", "completion": "It's not wimpy, or it's not something that we do so that we just kind of go along with circumstances and everything's okay with us."}

{"prompt": "Guided Metta Meditation", "completion": "May I be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "So it is likely that he could just as well have got the idea from there."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But I think also as human cultures evolve and people begin to explore and develop their religious and moral and social thinking and become more self-aware, and we are social empathetic creatures, then I think these sorts of ideas are likely to pop up in different contexts anyway."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But it is one of those texts that bears repeated reading."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "It is an extraordinary document, I feel."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "Although it may be the case that it was not spoken verbatim as soon as the Buddha got to the deer park and he delivered it, it has the appearance of a text that has been worked and reworked and refined."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "He would follow it and see an ancient city that had been inhabited by people in the past with parks, groves, ponds and ramparts, a delightful place."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But here, the path does not lead to the ending of dukkha, at least not explicitly, but it leads to the four noble truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "First, it enabled rulers to employ standing armies."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And that is a necessary precondition for the establishment of empire, in other words, for the conquest of territories and the establishment of a centralized power."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "When you have a community of wandering mendicants, of which the early Buddhist community was simply one example, you have the beginnings of what we would call philosophy and religion."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "That's how we get to the twelve."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "Then he says, the freedom of mind is unshakable."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "That dependent origination doesn't just refer to the twelve links, which you're perhaps familiar with, but it refers to a kind of underlying principle."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "But I'm going to tease that out in far more detail, I hope, this afternoon."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "As long as my knowledge and vision was not entirely clear about the twelve aspects of these four noble truths, I did not claim to have had a peerless awakening in this world with its humans and celestials, its gods and devils, its ascetics and priests."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "This is often translated as extremes, two extremes."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "It sort of keeps you stuck."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "Which is again, I think, a reference to how he sees his teaching as something that is not tied to the pattern of agrarian life."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And you find in the, both in the Hellenic world and in, of course, early Christianity, this attempt to differentiate this life of the mind from as being, as not being pagan."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "What the Buddha is presenting is, in the Eightfold Path, is a life that can flourish in all of its areas."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 2)", "completion": "And that requires the support of urban environments that provide security and wealth."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "I think we also mistakenly think that we've done something wrong if we can't do that."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Now you're attending to a particular body sensation, and then a sound, and then an emotion, and then another body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Sometimes that shifting between experiences, the attentional shift from one experience to another will be slower, sometimes more quick."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "The mind doesn't wander out of mindfulness, stability of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And the only thing that it's not moment to moment experience that we're absorbing into there, it's a concept, because it's the concept, the mind can hold onto a concept for some stretch of time."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And so our minds move away from that habit, that tendency to hold on to cling in favor of letting go and aligning ourselves with those truths, impermanent, unreliable, not self."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And through that attuning to change, that's really where the mind begins to let go of the habit of holding on."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So the impermanence, the attuning to change opens the doorway to understanding all of these insights which the Buddha pointed to his own experience of the liberation of that."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "On our usual way of thinking about things, it sounds like really almost depressing."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We learn a lot in this process of shaping the concentrated mind about what conditions, what wholesome conditions will support this kind of stabilized mindfulness, this stabilized attention."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "Basically, we see at some point it falls apart, the state falls apart."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "When we talk about impermanence, sometimes we think there's something that comes into being and something that falls apart."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "And we see that with this very, very deep, stable mind."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "That stable mind allows us to deeply understand the impermanent, unreliable, and also not self-nature of experience because we see in the way how rapidly things are changing."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "No room for a stable sense of self, no room for a stable experience."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "I've had experience of the mind deeply seeing into the impermanent and unreliable nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We can really then begin to recognize, yeah, the mind is clouded right now."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "It's like, wow, you know, this is so simple and there's no suffering right now."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "It's more that we notice that you have the attentions on this, and then the attentions on this."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "So it's like, we haven't really seen it shift from one to another, but we know, yeah, there was this and then it's kind of like, we've seen the middle of this object and then suddenly we're in the middle of this object."}
{"prompt": "Concentration in the Service of Understanding", "completion": "We might see the passing of the experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "It is visible here and now, immediate."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "And so the dharma beckons us to see, invites us to see, says, come look, come look."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "And it's not telling us, come learn, come read these books."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "I said, why would you bow to a teacup? So everything is important."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "I remember the first time I had this experience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "There's something that is welcoming us, inviting us to let that come to the foreground."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (3 of 5) Inviting Seeing", "completion": "I think maybe you'll feel the call to being aware."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And the encouragement to notice the arising and passing away of experience."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And so the meditative level helps to see that we cling to even a moment of experience, of a fleeting, pleasant experience, the way we want a meditation to be the way it was two or three days ago, or just some experience that comes up for a few moments and is unpleasant, how we want it to not be there."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "But we don't tend to usually take what is impermanent, you know, our family, you know, the way our children grow, or, you know, our homes, the way things change, things break."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And so, it's not just the direct experience of seeing things moment to moment changing, but the reflective capacity of our mind to know this is different now than it was a month ago."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And really hold that in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "We're not trying to have the perfect relationship with these reflections."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "That's the place to see, oh, okay, yeah, if I'm struggling to breathe, if it feels like I'm drowning, can the mind acknowledge and know, yes, this may be the way this being dies? Sometimes I found in this reflection, so right now I'm just kind of taking you through my own process around one reflection."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "For me that was a real doorway for the compassion, easier to feel, ease with the truth of impermanence for neutral people, but just to recognize and know that they too will be going through all of this stuff that I'm going through around these reflections, around this truth."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "You know, the planet, the planet is destined to be burned up by the sun at some point, at some point."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence and Compassion", "completion": "And also for me, that kind of helps me to hold the personal with a little more ease, that things are so impermanent on the larger scale."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "In the teaching on the mindfulness of the body, there's several, I think there's nine exercises of how to observe the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "It talks about observing all of our activities, walking, standing, speaking, being silent."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And I'll read that to you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I'm not going to try to talk about the whole of this refrain today, but one piece of it I do want to talk about."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And it's changed depending on whether it's pointing to the body or feelings or mind state."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So while this internal external isn't completely clear what it actually means, the commentaries come down on this side of observing self, observing our own personal experience, and observing the experience of others."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We've got quite a bit of experience, I think that a lot of the teachings that we do in the West, particularly I think that we that we have emphasized have explored this internal aspect of knowing what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "We see that the conditioned nature of our responses doesn't mean that that we have to follow those responses."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So that's how the establishment of mindfulness helps to lead, it helps to lead towards insight and understanding and freedom from that clinging towards this aversion, this acting on this aversion is the way I'm going to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "That begins to help our minds, especially if we have done some of our own work of what it means to observe a body as a body internally, and how the unfolding of that understanding leads to a release from some clinging and how not seeing the body as a body kind of can get us tied up into knots, taking it as my body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And then as we start to observe what's happening, we see there's this moment in the present moment where we can affect how conditions unfold."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But in the in daily life, we also have this whole realm of external practice, seeing how other people are."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "And then again, as I pointed out, the way in which it can not only help us see like that other beings are conditioned that that, you know, that the how we impute self to others is just a view is just an idea."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "I think at the basic level, it's unethical, you know, it's enough, it starts with unethical conduct create, you know, physical harm taking some something from someone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "So that it's, it's a benefit to ourselves also not to engage with those things."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness Internally and Externally", "completion": "But in this process of internal and external, we can look if we see something unexpected."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "Aware of what's happening in this moment, gently reconnecting with the felt sense of being embodied, grounded in the body, and then aware of the breathing, sensations of the in-breath, the out-breath, moment by moment, bringing a kind and curious attention."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "And it really doesn't matter how many retreats we've sat, the settling process is a normal thing to occur."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "So rather than, oh shit, I was gone, oh thank you for coming back."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "And so the other thing that's so useful to remember is that any moment you can have a fresh start."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "And whenever you leave the hall, you get to leave however the sit was behind and begin again."}
{"prompt": "Instructions: Mindfulness of Breathing", "completion": "So those are some useful things to remember."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "Some people say inviting inspection, they translated it."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "But I think to say it's visible here."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "So here we both of them have, you know, seeing in the meaning of it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "But as we begin to look more at some point, what becomes interesting and fascinating is not what we see and not that we can see clearly, but we can, it's the looking itself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (3 of 5) In the Looking", "completion": "Oh, there's where non-clinging ears."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Since this next few weeks, we'll be exploring some of the details in the Satipatanasuta."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "What I often offer and does seem to be generally supportive is to begin with using an awareness of the body and an awareness of relaxing in the body as a place to start to connect with mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Even the stomach and the intestines, maybe that can soften and relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "One is just the general sensation level in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "This communication between body and mind, this permeable kind of flow our body receives experience and lets our mind know about it."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Well, first of all, the one thing I would say is that the practice is not about mysticism."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's not a mystical practice."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "This is the irritating fact of ordinary life, isn't it, that all things are impermanent and things break down."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "He actually wrote a short story which was, I think, a wonderful title."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "That is dukkha, yet again, when we don't get what we want."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Bigger is actually again, it doesn't produce the goods, and it's often not permanent."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Just connecting with another tradition for a second and moving away from the early texts, this is what Dogen says, the great Japanese Zen thinker, that awakening is nothing other than the ability to live impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "This is the way of seeing things as they are, to see them as dukkha."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And, well, we certainly know this from the dookering point of view, but this is from another point of view, from the development of wholesome virtues, in the Madhapindika Sutta, which is the Honey Bull Sutta, Buddha basically says that however you incline the mind, that will become the shape of your life."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "How do you incline that change or generate that change in a direction that works in developing wholesome and skillful behaviors in your ordinary day-to-day existence? And that is the litmus test."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So much benefit of being here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So if we imprint, if we see, if we incline our minds with this greed aversion, if infatuation aversion and confusion, well that's what we get."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Yeah, let's face it, you're always in a mood."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "This is the question I think, perhaps these are questions that have to arise for everybody out of these teachings, is how do you deal with that? How are you going to live with a life that is full of that movement? That's the task, again."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Out of, I think, what the Buddha is saying in these early teachings, he's not, as I say, philosophizing about it, he's giving you a practical task."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "What is good in your life? Appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And then there's other stuff called study, or theory."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Which puts it right back in the context of religion and theistic religion in particular."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "But it's a trust or confidence is founded on something that you've already investigated and understood and experienced for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's not like the blind faith that you see often within religious traditions."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Now, you've probably become conscious of them now, of your earlobes, but actually what neither pleasant nor unpleasant is the absence of sensation."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's the actual absence of sensation there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So actually the Vedana will drag, drag in the sankharas of emotion."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So actually our emotions are off, well, aspects of forming our experience."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And actually our emotions are deep set narrative structures which rationalize experience."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "He's saying that all vinyana, all consciousness or cognizance is an embodied cognizance."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And the reason why I kind of scattered them over the board, I hate to get over the linear process, but they're also firing all together."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I've often felt that the teaching of no self is actually positively dangerous, to be quite honest."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Or, even if you're fairly balanced, to be suddenly confronted and told you've got no self, is, well, I came in with one, where's it gone? I've just left with a self-shaped hole."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "So, vinyana, this is also implicated in the process."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "As I wrote, I might as well just read you what I wrote here because I can't really say it any better here."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "If we follow through on that, and I'm just thinking in terms of our ordinary experience, if we often follow through on our desires, we think we're somehow going to get pleasurable, intensified experience."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "This is again personal in the sense of the way I see this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Personally speaking, I can say I have absolutely no interest in jhana practice ever."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "But my question is, what would you say to a relatively young person whose life has."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's a tactical question, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "But you do have to go through a lot of modifications."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I think the worst thing you could possibly do is talk about Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "I just want to ask you one question."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "You know, it's the coming together of certain perceptual processes and sankharas, ways of doing things, habituations, you know, proclivities of behavior that arise."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And one of the things you have to remember is that we're deeply, deeply conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Unpleasant experience give rise to certain forms of perception and certain narratives that come involved."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "You said there are 6,000 sutras, I think you said."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "And my question is what is the breadth and scope of this subject so one wants to tackle the sutras in India, go to India."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "It's the basic teachings of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "You've got Bhikkhu Bodhis in the Buddha's words which is extracts from the sutras of all the important sutras there, but if you wanted to take say one Nikhaya, probably the most important one would be the Majama Nikhaya the middle length discourses because there is an awful lot of material contained in that which is absolutely central like the Satipatana Sutta which deals with obviously mindfulness the Madhupindika Sutta which deals with the whole of the cognitive process and so on and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 3", "completion": "Well, it is, but I mean not everybody has aptitude for languages do they? I mean, I do appreciate that."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "I'll read this little section to you."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "The word dhamma can just be experience."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And so we could look at this, at this definition of establishing mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So I did want to just put it in the context of this phrase, though the term clear comprehension in the context of this phrase."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And not just observing experience, observing it as experience."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "We aren't typically, before we meet mindfulness practice, we aren't typically looking at or observing experience as experience."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "We don't do the establishment of mindfulness but we set conditions up such that mindfulness will become established."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "I have a sense of it in my own experience as being more receptive, not an active quality so much, but more of an establishment of a state of receptive knowing experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "So again the term full awareness isn't defined here and yet we are encouraged to do it all day long."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "When walking a bhikkhu knows, I am walking."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "What does it mean to act in full awareness? One simple way, know that you are walking while you're walking, know that you're reaching while you're reaching, know that you're talking while you're talking."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "There's another place where it mentions the same thing, it says, somebody being questioned asking if they know, saying I do not know or not seeing says I see, says this in full awareness speaking falsehood for their own ends or another's ends or for some trifling worldly end."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And to me this is kind of like the context, understanding the context of what's happening."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "While one is giving attention to voidness, one one's mind does not enter into voidness or require confidence, steadiness or decision in that, when one can have full awareness of that."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "In another place it gives a kind of a practice, how, how does one exercise clear comprehension? When I found this, it's like, oh finally, this is what I've been looking for, how do we do this, how do we exercise clear comprehension? It says here, one understands feelings as they arise, as they persist, as they pass away, one understands perceptions as they arise, persist, and pass away, one understands thoughts as they arise, persist, and pass away."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "And it can also be understood as the insight that comes with the establishment of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "Only aware of what's here, that's clearly comprehending aspect of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "One understands feelings as they arise, persist, and pass away while looking ahead and looking away."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "I mentioned earlier it didn't have to be that close to be very profound, that you could just know that you're talking while you're talking, know that you're walking while you're walking, know that you're reaching while you're reaching, and that that simple level, and the simpleness of that, just the very simplicity of that, begins to create the continuity that opens the mind to being able to see this amazing, impermanent flux of our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "Again, with that understanding of what's wholesome, what's unwholesome, recognizing the context of our experience."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "What is the domain of our, what is the field, what is the range of our experience of our mindfulness practice, what's the range of our practice."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "This is an opinion that's arising."}
{"prompt": "The Quality of Clear Comprehension", "completion": "We are aware of what's arising."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And mental formations, the kind of active part of our minds, the emotional mind state intentional, volitional aspect of experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And so after that conversation last week, the question came up about, you know, kind of what holds them together, or the question was, what's the container of the aggregates? And my response last week as I just kind of thought about it off the top of my head was that karma or the process of conditioning is kind of what holds the aggregates together."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And yet, you know, these aggregates are kind of described as continually coming together and falling apart in this kind of process."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "I think what I said last time was like, you know, my body and mind processes don't just suddenly disintegrate and then take, take up residence on the moon or, you know, in another county of California, it's like, there's some kind of coherence to the unfolding of this process of body and mind."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And so that's a, that's another teaching that I'll probably get to at some point in this series of conversations on not self as the teaching of dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And that might be, for instance, if, if there's anger arising in the mind shaping or kind of impelling us to act, then that tends to create conditions for certain things to unfold."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And so we get to know what's happening in our minds, we get to see these mental formations at work, and we begin to understand how particular mental formations tend to get us into trouble, you know, tend to take us in a particular direction."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Why I do things and sometimes the sense of control that I am the one who chooses, I am the one who acts, I'm the one who decides even as these job descriptions, I described the movement of aversion being to separate, that that's the job description of aversion."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "It doesn't take a me deciding to do that when aversion arises, that's the tendency."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So I will read this section."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So that's his translation, fabrication instead of volitional formation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Why do you call them fabrications? Because they fabricate fabricated things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Bear with me, it sounds pretty complex to start, but why do you call them fabrications? Because they fabricate fabricated things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So as they not only are created, it arises based on something in the past, but it is the tumbling on of the aggregates is because of volitional formation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "Let's talk about what it would mean if we have anger arising."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "What does anger fabricate? How does anger fabricate form? So how does anger affect the body? Another way to put this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "What does it tend to do to feeling? How does that anger shape the experience of feeling? It tends to make feeling unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "So that's what it shapes in terms of feeling."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "You know, when we're angry, we tend to recognize, you know, it might be, for instance, if we're, if we have an aversive state in our mind and we see an expression flit upon somebody's face, you know, maybe we interpret that, we perceive that expression as being somehow an attack on us because we have an aversive state of mind."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "It's not that our, our sight, our sound, all of our physical senses are not like these bare receivers."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "That itself is a learning and understanding a mental formation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Fabricating Experience", "completion": "And just to say that, you know, you'd asked for, you'd asked for some suture references and I created a list of them and I will post those suture references with the talk."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Who are you? Maybe this feels a little like freedom."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "This is an enlightened, compassionate intention to be free."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Maybe take a minute and look at each other and realize that she's just like me."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Maybe look at yourself for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "See that in yourself, that you yourself have this compassion for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Mingyur Rinpoche, maybe the leading Tibetan Rinpoche of our time, says how essential it is to recognize this in ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "This is the heart of meditation, is to recognize the inherent goodness in oneself and all beings."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "There he is, the king of Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Certainly the king of Tibetan Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "It's so easy to see the goodness in others."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "And if I go with the intention to get people to like me, and then I, so I go in that room, a lot of people, you know, and, and, oh, this is the most important, important person to like me."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "So I go to that person first."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "That's one experience of the party."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Second step is the intention of kindness."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "So please enjoy your discussions, you know, watch the time so that it's, you know, equal and we'll come back in about 20 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "We are having a half day in person for the senior sangha on April 14th."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "In my group, Gail wasn't there, but in my group, we were talking about a comment you made, David, about, um, we go in with good intentions, but we come out with recriminations about our behavior."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Be prepared before you go in."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "It's good to not depend on how and whether I'm feeling love and kindness."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "Uh, I had to come in late."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for March 2022", "completion": "So, um, I missed, uh, what David did, but I, I think that I'm not going to go too far off the rails."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And now are the top, not themes, but the top ten talks that people asked for from different teachers."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So when you're afraid, you don't get angry at yourself or treat yourself negatively like you're a bad person for being afraid."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "But you know, there's many more fears."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "One of the great places to look at fear is on a meditation retreat, where not only do we develop over time a personal stability and calm that's greater than what we'd have in our ordinary life, but the environment tends to be fairly stable and calm, and often kind of more conducive towards meeting the messengers, meeting what's going on, and seeing it in a clearer way, or a more independent way, a freer way than we would if we get easily entangled with it."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "We're not complicating it with all these reactions and thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Your job is to help your fear feel safe."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Your fear is afraid, right? That's the nature of it."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So then once the fear feels safe, there's a few things that happens."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So we can do that also kind of directly by being with the fear itself."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And sometimes being with the fear, offering the fear safety, and we're exposing ourselves to what's going on, and rather than recoiling or getting agitated or being by it, it's kind of like exposing ourselves to it."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I don't want to belittle the dangers that exist in our world, that definitely are dangers."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "That might be the first task."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Not that you have to do a lot of busy analysis and figuring out, but over time, if you have an occasion to meditate with fear and be present for it, you'll start learning these different dimensions of who you are."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And so he was up close during the details."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And then at some point, he stepped back 10 feet to look at the dragon tiger he had made."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And it was so realistic, he got afraid and ran away."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "So not only do we help our own fear to feel safe from ourselves, but the idea that other people no longer have to fear us."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I remember going in freshman and college."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I guess we wrote essays and things."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "It was once during the semester you had to go to the office hours with the professor."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And so the first one-on-one instruction I got from my Zen teachers was, Gail, breathe deeply."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "If you take time to get familiar with your fear and you look at it and make space for it and don't dismiss it, don't override it, don't think that the right thing to do is just courageously burst through it and overcome it by just kind of overriding it, that certainly has its time and place."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "We have about five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "If we talk like this, maybe there's some burning question or concern or something you're afraid of that you want to bring up."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And so we can take a couple of minutes for one or two."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And I was sitting there and she said, letting go of all your attachments to self."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "And I was delighted because I could actually see that because I know there's a lot of fears that I don't see, but that just came for me."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "I appreciate your comments."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Fear of what? I have a fear of bringing up a different subject, kind of, than a personal."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "We're going to be going to see our congresspeople."}
{"prompt": "Befriending Fear", "completion": "Take one more question or comment."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "First of all, there's a broad awareness which can receive many experiences, many different kinds of experiences."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "We can sometimes touch into a sense of a vibratory energy throughout the body or a sense of an emotional tone that's felt in the body."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "I talk about it in retreat practice when people get a little quieter and it's sometimes what happens as the mind gets quieter, it begins to touch into these broader experiences more kind of almost more naturally in a way."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "It's a psychological technique described by a psychologist Eugene Gentlin."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And mostly I had been exploring touching into that broader sense when the mind got quieter."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And so I played around with it and it's extremely valuable."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "And that took its power away."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "In a way, it felt like in exploring it in my walking, it was almost a more grounded sense of how I am while I was walking, as opposed to noticing all of the different sights and sounds and smells."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "But I do feel that it's a really interesting and valuable aspect to explore attending to in our daily lives."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "I've been in kind of a bad mood, same thing, interaction with people, and I tend to get quite angry, you know, like I could see the anger in me rising, but I tried, I didn't think it was worth it to get angry and I tried to see all the best possible reason why this person might not be doing these things to provoke me, but it's just their habit, they're doing this."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "But at the same time, my old habit, I could see the frustration and the inability to be calm, you know, I had lost it."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "But I got through that two hour meeting."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "So that was still floating in my mind."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "We don't want to go into the details."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Broad Awareness in our Daily Lives", "completion": "Hey, I just wanted to thank you."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion + Mindfulness of the Breath = Tonglen Practice", "completion": "In breath, and out breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Compassion + Mindfulness of the Breath = Tonglen Practice", "completion": "Maybe with each in breath, we become more, become aware."}

{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And but, but when we actually hold in our mind or take in that, that we don't know what's going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "They don't like to take that truth in."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And that kind of that, that the vagueness of that, the diffuseness of that is that kind of state of, of agitation and uncertainty about, about what's going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "I don't know that that's so much about the anxieties there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Today, that's what it was like, I don't have enough information to make a decision."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's like all of that energy, it's like none of those things happened."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And those times that I did, think of something that actually might have happened."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And to practice being present with what's here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Because that's the skill that's going to help me then."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "That's kind of a reflection that I've used around trying to help the mind let go of that tendency to go down the rabbit hole of branching decisions, branching worries."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "The thing that's going to help me most in that moment is to actually be present."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And so it's useful to look at what is actually this fear, worry or anxiety connected to."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "We don't actually experience what's out there, we experience it in a kind of a reflection in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Our minds can begin to, through the being with them, can begin to tease apart the discernment from the extra."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Actually, I think the fear, the anxiety creates enough agitation in the mind that it actually gets in the way of possible solutions, of the mind having more expansiveness and space to look at what possible solutions might be."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And the fear, the anxiety, the worry also tend to think that if there's a problem, that this is the only response."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Fear has to happen when this discernment happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "So I think I'll talk a little bit about being mindful of these states, because this is, I mostly talked about kind of the, what we can, how we might be able to hold them in a different way, learn something about these qualities of mind from a different perspective than our usual perspective."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Either through the worry in the mind, I think often what happens in meditation when these things come up is that our minds just go launch into the worry in doing the planning and the multiple branches of figuring out how am I going to solve this."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "The mind kind of running off into its worry loop is taking action on the fear effectively."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "What does it feel like to have had those thoughts there? So you're coming into the body feeling the physicality of what the experience of this state is."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Anxiety often has a very diffuse kind of feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And so can you be with that? Can you know oh this is what it's like to feel fear? This is what it's like to feel anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "When you're thinking those thoughts and involved in those thoughts you've got your foot on the gas pedal and you are just going with that emotion."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "But putting your system in neutral kind of to just be with that experience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Maybe you can hold the experience of the fear of the anxiety for a little while and watch what happens."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "So there's a lot that you can explore just through that kind of turning to the body."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "Actually there is something that I don't know is going to happen so this comes back to that uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "It involves like an uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "So I think that's really important to know the difference between those two."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And it wasn't awful, but it wasn't ideal."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "If we don't resist it, you're seeing what's happening already."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "You're seeing what has been happening."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety, Worry and Fear", "completion": "And if you can really just have a curiosity about it all, that's what I mostly want to encourage is curiosity."}

{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And when the mind relaxes very naturally, it's not caught up in thoughts of past or future or thoughts of present."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And so when the mind and body are relaxed, our system, our organism is kind of doing what it's designed to do, which is to be aware."}

{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And so just acknowledging that, yes, awareness is here."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "You don't have to try to figure out how you know awareness is here."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "It's kind of like you're asking your body and mind to see, to show you if there's more relaxation that our system knows how to connect with, that our system has access to, that we don't have conscious access to."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "Just dropping that in and then seeing what happens."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "Don't even think about what it means, just ask the system."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "Am I aware? Is there awareness? Sometimes it might be framed as a kind of a recognition, oh, awareness is here."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "There's often body experience that's involved."}

{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "There's a sense of just a flow of receiving without needing to do too much to remember to do it."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And then we may begin to also then recognize of when we lose touch with that quality."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "A crucial part of the practice is having a skillful relationship to the moment when we recognize mindfulness returning."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "The recognition or the attuning to what that's like for mindfulness to return."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "If so, it can be useful to reattune to relaxing the body, just using that as a way to reconnect, relaxing the body, relaxing the mind again."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And yet that wandering mind has affected the mind."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "And when mindfulness returns, if we're not judging ourselves for having been wandering, we can touch into that letting go that has happened."}

{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "There's the physical movement of the body, but we're not necessarily attuning to that."}
{"prompt": "Receptive Awareness: Basic Instructions", "completion": "You can attune to that if that's what's obvious, but often seeing and hearing are what's obvious in the walking."}

{"prompt": "New Year's Resolutions", "completion": "And it's this sticking with things, even when it is difficult, so a certain amount of stick-tuitiveness."}
{"prompt": "New Year's Resolutions", "completion": "So, resolve, Aditana is one of the Paramis, and I talked about this, I gave a talk about it in November."}
{"prompt": "New Year's Resolutions", "completion": "Whereas stubbornness has this way in which we might feel stuck."}
{"prompt": "New Year's Resolutions", "completion": "So to change our behavior we can focus on conditions, processes, systems, and the Buddha to be sure taught a lot about this too."}
{"prompt": "New Year's Resolutions", "completion": "An obvious example is some people listen to, so common now, right? Podcasts or books on tape and with audible, to be listening to have this, something that's really engaging and fascinating and interesting, really enjoyable for you."}

{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And one teacher, Tarania, came up with this very beautiful way of understanding that phrase."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so in that fourth foundation, understanding phenomena as Dhamma, as truth, and understands phenomena in its nature of a rising, in its nature of vanishing, or in its nature of a rising and vanishing."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "It's, in many ways, there's the four noble truths I understand really as often the four noble truths are phrased, something like, there is suffering, there's the origin of suffering, or the cause of suffering, which is craving, there's the ending of suffering, which is the ending of craving, and there is the way leading to the ending of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "When we are aware of the experience of suffering, it's co-arising."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so right there in the four noble truths, it's bringing two of these key understandings and insights together, the understanding of impermanence and the understanding of dukkha, of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "This same sutta also points to different emotional relationships to the seeing of impermanence, that sometimes what happens when we see the impermanent nature of experience, the kind of longing for liberation arises, the wish for freedom arises, or sometimes in the seeing of that impermanent nature of experience, equanimity arises."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And then another, another, this phrase from this suit is one of my favorites, very evocative for me at times, it's one of those where the sentence will arise in my practice and just like help the mind to just recognize and let go."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so rewording this perhaps, one with right view does not take a stand about myself and has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only unreliable experience arising and what ceases is only unreliable experience ceasing."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I mean, as I'm saying that I'm delighted to think about that, but sometimes I can imagine, certain times my mind kind of goes, that's all that's happening, what's the point? But that's the perspective of they're needing to be something reliable."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And in my own experience, I finally realized, you know, as I'm not judging that, the mindfulness coming and going, that the arising of mindfulness can be very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "In a few moments, it can be very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So this is another place where sometimes in our practice, we have the habit of, and of thinking what being mindful means, as I'm seeing a lot of detail about the objects of experience."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And the Buddha encouraged us to daily recollect the nature of our humanness as being subject to aging, illness, and death."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "We kind of assume, you know, we see other people dying, we see other people getting sick, but we don't necessarily remember regularly that, yes, this body too will die."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So that lamp isn't going to survive that."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And then it was refined and heated up."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "There's a whole process of many steps that had this come into being."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "But then I pointed to, you know, actually the suffering around objects in a way is not so much about the fact that objects are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Another useful reflection, again, this is, so that the reflective process, you know, we sometimes dismiss in our, in our preferencing for being mindful in a very non-discursive way, we don't appreciate so much the value of reflection."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so another kind of reflection that the Buddha offered around, you know, the ownership of things or the kind of way in which we attribute happiness to having some kind of hold on something."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And again, this is bringing into play the, the understandings around how we cling to things, thinking they're reliable and we think they're reliable because we think they're permanent."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So the Buddha said that, yes, there will be some kind of happiness around the having of things and the having of experiences."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So we see the impermanent nature of that happiness, which is based on, often based on the impermanent nature of what we had relied on for that happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "We probably don't necessarily see that flickering."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And we don't see the gaps."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And then there's another piece that comes into play that's pretty profound."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Now, this maybe can be revealed in some simple ways."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And part of that is because we tend to see things as they have been in the past."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "We see the conditioned nature of our minds habitually having the arisings of reactivity, the habits around greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So that's where the feeling arises, believing it's a snake unpleasant feeling along with knowing and having many associations about what snakes mean, whole huge like complex of stuff coming together to create that feeling tone and we think it's just a snake making me feel like, you know, unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating the Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "But so much of the practice the Buddha pointed to as being a very gradual unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (3 of 5) Consious of Pleasure", "completion": "So something as simple as a human touch."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (3 of 5) Consious of Pleasure", "completion": "It's part of a bigger system and hormones and all kinds of things going on."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (3 of 5) Consious of Pleasure", "completion": "These are all metaphors or something that doesn't really exist, but we have a kind of intuitive sense for."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (3 of 5) Consious of Pleasure", "completion": "And I don't know if it, you know, I don't think it's in and of itself, but as things get simpler and simpler and quieter and the awareness can, can come tune into these other systems that are working in harmony, the sense of harmony creates pleasure for awareness itself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (3 of 5) Consious of Pleasure", "completion": "And offering respect to that means make room, feel that, feel what's going on in some bigger way."}
{"prompt": "Fear (1 of 4) Understanding Fear", "completion": "For many people, at some points in their lives, it's often fundamental."}
{"prompt": "Fear (1 of 4) Understanding Fear", "completion": "And if it is unfounded or not really necessary, what it is a symptom of is something deeper inside of us that does need attention, does need our care and our mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Fear (1 of 4) Understanding Fear", "completion": "So we can't kind of look at it clearly and see it as something little bit objective, little bit."}
{"prompt": "Fear (1 of 4) Understanding Fear", "completion": "And there are healthy forms of that and there are those which are not so healthy."}
{"prompt": "Fear (1 of 4) Understanding Fear", "completion": "That we have a capacity for something like self-respect."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And there's a common phenomenon, at least for me, of doing these things."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And then I start doing it, and I don't like it."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And it seems like a lot of work, a lot of effort has to go in."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And then, if I keep doing it, and doing it, after a while, part of it becomes easier and easier."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And there's often a very nice feeling of, you know, for a while, and then after a while, I get tired, and then it gets hard."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "Every step, every breath, every kind of thing that's going on, the movements of the body, everything comes kind of alive, and I'm just right there with those things."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "I got to see them, and recognize them, and they quieted down, and quieted down, and slowed down."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "Even like with running, you get into the flow."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And then every day you tear out one telephone page, one page."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And over, I don't know how many pages you have to do, 300 pages or 1,000 pages."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "So gradual that if you're looking for progress day by day, it will be hopeless."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "So for some people, it's a slow process."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "There's all those changes."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "Sometimes people sit down to meditate."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "If you pull the plug, the geyser comes and all this water flows out."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And kind of a gentle current that comes up just flows like a fountain of water coming through the water."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "It's a natural process that when certain conditions are in place, then something begins to take over."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "In the same way, these marvelous things that can flow out in meditation, that can grow and develop, they are all built on the foundation."}

{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "So these things start to arise, and so oddly enough for people who do mindfulness practice, the way it's talked about here in the West, mindfulness itself is not described as something that's done, but mindfulness is something that arises based on our ability to keep observing what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "There's observation, and there's what's sati, there's mindfulness."}

{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And for the Buddha, an important part of the support is to allow these deeper states to come up to kind of condition or inspire or settle the heart so it can finally feel safe just to let go, just to be."}
{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "And it's a marvelous thing to kind of feel that this process happens, you know, there's a whole idea of self that speaks, such a complicated, complex world, self, me, myself and mine, who I think I am, how I think people see me, how I want to be seen, the identities I hold on to, all these things, it's a complicated world that our society around us supports us to have and to be and to defend and to project and to hold on to."}

{"prompt": "Balance Between Doing And Allowing", "completion": "So it's not just a matter of letting go of thoughts, but it's also letting go of our thoughts or quieting them down and letting go into kind of space, into quiet or silence where the mind is not incessantly thinking and doing and wanting."}

{"prompt": "This is What has Come to Be", "completion": "And so that exploration in our formal practice of aligning ourselves of what is arising right now, the awareness of that is what the meditation is supposed to be, can help us in our daily lives to check and see, are there any agendas, are there any abuser ideas about what's going on right now, that's extra, you know, the extra ideas of this shouldn't be happening, or this is wrong, I'm bad, I haven't got this right, all of the kind of self-view, and that's something else I've noticed, the kind of subtle self-view that comes in with comparing what the meditation is today versus what it was a few weeks ago, or what the meditation is now versus what it was yesterday."}

{"prompt": "Working With Pain", "completion": "And so I would begin the meditation by using the rise and fall of the abdomen as the point of focus and then what would be the usual pattern is that I would begin with fairly good concentration on the rise and fall of the abdomen but to the extent that the mind became focused on the rise and fall, the awareness of the pain in the head would increase to the point that would deflect my attention from the movement of the abdomen."}
{"prompt": "Working With Pain", "completion": "And it became an extremely interesting and even powerful subject of meditation because what I discovered is that one begins by paying attention to the area where one feels the pain."}

{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "Okay, good afternoon everybody."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "Okay, the first of these is what I call faith."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "And this is the Pali word sada."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "And I would explain faith in this sense as I call it a conviction that there is some force or power within and behind the working of events that is capable of sustaining us and helping us overcome obstacles in our quest to fulfill the good."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "But when one engages in altruistic activity one is at any level in some way negating the self, sacrificing the self, forgetting the self."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "And what keeps us, what makes us willing to undertake that sacrifice to work for the sake of others is this faith that this law or principle behind the play of phenomena is going to support us."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "And so if the little girl is reflecting according to the logic of a stone, she'll think my body is much heavier than the stone."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "The second quality essential to the practice of conscientious compassion is compassion itself and compassion has these two aspects that is compassion as the meditative state of compassion and compassion as a commitment to action perhaps they're represented in the polytext by the two words and this is not a scholarly pronouncement so if there are any real polyscholars here don't trip me up on this otherwise I'll get angry and I can take revenge but it seems like Karuna is usually used in reference to the meditative state of compassion, the second of the four divine dwellings of Brahma Vihara but the compassion and action seems to be represented by the word Anukkampa or we have the expression Anukkampa Nupadaya usually translated for the sake of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Seven Factors of Conscientious Action", "completion": "You know it's very easy in a sense or at least it seems easy to sit down and think I'm going to suffuse the whole world with compassion and then one thinks may all beings be free from suffering may all be free from sorrow, may all be free from fear may all be free from suffering and that can make one feel very nice, very lofty very noble person but to really generate what I would call a strong current of compassion what's useful is to focus in on these specific cases that you might hear about from friends, read about in the newspaper see on the news cases of individuals who are really subjected to personal suffering and when one brings them to mind moving from one to another to another not too quickly you dwell on them for a couple of minutes this is what sort of unleashes that force of compassion in the mind and then that can provide the sort of the fuel to radiate the compassion out universally okay so then we have compassion as the meditative state and then we have belief system and motivations for putting compassion into action that is especially as Buddhist have the example of the Buddha himself who engaged throughout his life in compassionate activity especially by teaching the Dhamma but not only by teaching the Dhamma maybe some of you have heard the story about how there was one monk who was ill with the kind of skin disease so that his boils would appear on his body and they would break open and pus would flow out and none of the other monks would look after him because when they were sick he didn't do anything to help them so the monks thought there's no need for us to help him let his karma just take its own course with him so then Ananda reported to the Buddha that this monk was sick in the infirmary and that he was a young monk, an unknown monk who was being disregarded by the other monks and so the Buddha went to that monk with Ananda he asked Ananda to bring a basin of hot water and the Buddha himself washed the wounds of that monk and treated him with some kind of medicinal salve and then helped to bring that monk back to normal health okay so the second motivating factor that I mentioned now is compassion and I spoke about this morning the third factor again I mentioned this this morning but it doesn't hurt to come back to it is what I call the commitment to justice, the sense of what I would call spiritual and economic justice which doesn't commit one to any kind of egalitarian socialism according to which everybody should have the same standard of living but it does commit one to the idea that nobody should be allowed to sink to a position of destitution and of need to have the conviction that everybody should be is entitled, intrinsically entitled to live at a standard of personal decency to live in a way that they can feel their own inner dignity that they could live with the sense of self-respect that will also win the respect of others the sense of justice which I take to be very fundamental to my own conception of the Dharma of the Buddha is based on what I would call the perception of the essential unity of all living beings, especially all human beings the idea that we are all alike no matter what our gender might be, no matter what our race or our origins, color of the skin religious beliefs, social class all of that becomes irrelevant when we put it alongside what is truly critical, truly essential and that is the idea that every living being and every human being wants to be well, wants to be happy the Dharma in suffering wants to be able to live and to live abundantly I don't mean to live luxuriously, but to live abundantly in the sense to expand one's intellectual horizons to expand one's cultural horizons and at the ultimate to expand one's spiritual horizons in fact the way I've been thinking a little bit about the needs of human beings, I've seen that there's a kind of hierarchy of needs that have to be met to bring true human fulfillment and here my thinking along this line has been very much influenced by Dr."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "But the other day I had this strange experience that I really never had in meditation before that by the end of, I was kind of concentrating a lot on my body and on my hands, like we had talked about last week."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "It was the first time that I hadn't wanted to open my eyes and that I was really actually disappointed that the meditation was going to end, so it was a nice experience."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "The second arrow could be, you know, being angry with yourself or deciding to do meditation instead of doing yoga."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And that's part of the gift of meditation is that in meditation there's no emotion which is considered unacceptable."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "So you know, so the different people have come to emotions from a different backgrounds, different attitudes, different beliefs, different limitations on top of our emotions, different things we want to emphasize."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "So to respect the emotions means let's take another look here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "If you're sleepy, the alert part is important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "If you're really agitated, the comfortable part is important."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And I said, why couldn't you leave yesterday and yesterday? Why did you have to haul it in to now, when it was so special, so rare for her? So what I'm trying to say is sometimes we fuel and keep emotions going by the stories we tell."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And so to really be mindful of the emotion in and of itself, it helps if we can not approach it through the filter of the story making mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "So what we do in mindfulness practice is to go look around, see where is it, what part of the body is energized or activated, or where does this emotion express itself in the body, and then bring the attention there and continue with the mindfulness of the body approach that we did last week, and just, you know, just experience sensations of the body and feel it and sense it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "Like when you felt that warmth all over your body, it felt kind of like joy or happy or well, something."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And so the idea is to do nothing and just be with what is and learn what that's like without any extra help and support."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "Is this really true? Do I have to kind of keep believing these kinds of reactions, these kinds of thoughts? Is there an alternative way? Could I have a terrible meditation and somehow not make a big story out of, not make a conclusion, not judge it? And can I not have these second arrows?

{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "May it be, may you be happy."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "So then repeat again after me."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And then the last minute or two, you might just now sit here, very simply, mindful of your breathing, mindful of how you're feeling, present here for what's going on for you in a simple way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 3: Mindfulness of Emotions", "completion": "And the mindfulness practice doesn't then shade into becoming self-aware, shades into being self-conscious, self-conscious shades into changing to become self-critical."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Peace Is The Highest Bliss", "completion": "The Buddha said, peace is the highest bliss."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Peace Is The Highest Bliss", "completion": "And when we first hear that, maybe it's a little quizzical because peace perhaps seems so settled, you know, there's not a lot of happiness or bliss to it seems kind of like peace."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Peace Is The Highest Bliss", "completion": "If you if we think about it, maybe we don't get it because these things are not concepts in such a constant, you might have the concept that actually does not really correspond to the true exploration."}

So let me talk a little bit about Sona."}

{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "So of these qualities, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, what do you think is the most common one if, you know, what would you think? Well, the one that's listed the most is energy, effort, nine times."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "And if we aren't attuning to the quality of our effort, we might sit down, close our eyes, sit up straight, try and stop the thoughts, get really serious about meditating, and have a horrible experience meditating, and decide at the end, I suck, I can't do this."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "Because, yeah, no, I definitely hear this from people, they're trying to figure out what the right amount of effort is to put into a practice."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "And you know, I don't know, for the first couple of years, maybe I'd be swimming a lot in the summer and then when it would get cold in the winter, I just would be like, oh, my own body would tense up and it was just like, I can't, I can't do it."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "And so I'm walking and I can feel my body wanting to duck, I don't know the best word for that, but to, to, to try and avoid the drops of rain."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "I just, it just was very freeing."}

{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "I stopped seeing the light in the water, right, sort of having these blinders on."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "Sometimes during the course of a retreat, you'll see it's better to sit longer sits."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "So there's effort that can feel cold and hard and brittle, right, that's often thought of as striving, and there's effort that can feel like it's hot and saggy, right? And then there's the not too hot, not too cold, right, middle way."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "And I think we do need to be really receptive and sensitive and tuned in and creative in how we work with our own effort and bring the heart and the wisdom to it."}
{"prompt": "Tuning into Effort", "completion": "And this is sort of the hard wiring or the soft wiring of the brain is to orient us toward that which is more of a threat than that which is a gift."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "The awareness now feels broader, more expanded."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "And so they walk right into the water, and the water gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and maybe suddenly there's an alleged that there's no more ground in it, but they're so concerned with the phone call, they're not paying any attention to floating, and so they drown."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (42) Prioritizing Beneficial States of Mind", "completion": "And what this refers to is the states of enlightenment, states of realization, that this movement into this open awareness, calm, peaceful states can grow and develop."}

{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And that was a function of the fact that there was this kind of longing for the Dharma, longing to understand my mind, to know what was possible, to know how deeply the heart could rest, how expansive the mind could be."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "We miss the moment, oh, this is what helplessness feels like."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And in a way, it's the peak, it's the clarity, it's the openness, it's the love that actually makes more room for what is unresolved in the heart to arise."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And this process of spiraling, it like keeps going until we're more and more free, until there's less and less that can kind of ambush the heart-mind."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "But we're not actually trying to re-engineer our preferences."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And so there's this aspect of practice as we begin to actually bless our past with wisdom and love, that there's a sense of the past is actually being transformed."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "Just being human, in a sense, is a little bit more intense than we can handle."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "So in Buddhism the self is not a thing but an experience, a process that arises and passes in the same way that sound arises and passes."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And to love the self to death is to actually see what feels like the ground of my being, to see that as a rising, flowing experience."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And then the philosopher described as self as the center of narrative gravity."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "The center of narrative gravity."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And so in this sense, there's a kind of continuum from self harshness that moves more and more towards something like self acceptance, self love."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And the attention gets more precise and more quiet."}
{"prompt": "Loving the Self to Death", "completion": "And then the actual components, the experiences that create the sense of I amness, we love that also to death."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And in fact the emotional manifestations of awakening, of freedom that the Buddha points to is most commonly associated with happiness and peace."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "But that's not wrong to have that happen in the circumstances."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "It's possible to kind of pretend we're peaceful or kind of hold ourselves, kind of contain ourselves in a certain kind of way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And sometimes it's healthy just to move between them with fluidity and it's okay to be activated."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And so navigating between this is part of this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And so spend time and when you're agitated, and with a question, what is this agitation? How am I experiencing it? What's being triggered? Where does it live in me? What's my relationship to this agitation? Do I believe it? Do I go headlong into it? Am I resisting it? Am I judging it? Am I critical of myself for being agitated? There's all these things to study and become much more aware of."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "We want to get to understand and become connoisseurs and recognize it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And then we don't want to become attached to letting go."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "We don't want to be attached to these deeper states of well-being and peace that might be there."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "Where we're centered in such a way that the kind of a peace goes with us, a calm goes with us, even when we're busy and activated in doing things, it's not far away."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "And that spaciousness can feel calm, can feel open."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "If we are peaceful but peaceful is kind of like we're holding ourselves peaceful or it's very palpable, a kind of state of peace that is a kind of feeling, that's wonderful."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Finding our Way (5 of 5) with Peach and Aggitation", "completion": "So to navigate this world of ours with the idea that we want to make room for all of who we are in this way, this particular wave where there's no attachments, no clinging."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "We let go of things that seem less necessary for basic, you know, sometimes even just basic survival, basic relationship."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "What leads us towards this cure? Now this medical model, it's amazing to me that 2,600 years ago the Buddha identified in the structure of the human mind that is the linchpin that causes, or that is the key linchpin that is how the suffering is put together in our system, and that if that linchpin shifts or is pulled out, then the suffering falls apart."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "It's a real opportunity for us to frame and look at our choices, our intentions and our motivations through this lens of what allows us to become more at ease, more at peace in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "It just says that with wise mindfulness we need to be clearly comprehending."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "Then the Buddha says, Now again, this doesn't describe what it means to be fully alert, but it encourages us to do it all the time."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "You're inating and defecating are in here."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So clear comprehension is a kind of a neutral word."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "It is a knowing what's happening, a being aware."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And so this brings in that sense of conscious attention."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So those are some of the pieces that are framed in the suttas around this word."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "If it's harming, then at a deeper level, it's understood to not be suitable."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "I'm finding patience is helpful in the store because people do not see these arrows, and they're coming the other way, so there's lots of opportunities in the store for holding kindness and compassion to recognize how afraid everyone is and offering some wishes of kindness to give somebody space."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "The domain piece is really."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "It means field, like where cows would graze."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "And the understanding of the impermanent nature of experience helps us to realize there's nothing that can be clung to."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "Trying to cling to it is an exercise in futility and creates stress, creates suffering."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So taking some time to reflect on your aspirations for your life, what are your highest aspirations and ideals? How does your practice support those aspirations? Which of your daily activities directly support those aspirations? So that's one."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So that's something to sit with for a while, rather than to immediately try to figure out."}
{"prompt": "Priorities, Purpose and Motivation", "completion": "So it's like okay, I'm just kind of letting that be, and just holding it as okay, well that's a piece of my day, and it's not the most suitable thing in terms of getting to my larger aspiration, but it feels like there's something that's happening underneath that I'm not so clear about."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So, as I said a moment ago, I want to explore with you what the concept of self-acceptance is in the context of Buddhist meditation."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Therefore, as I mentioned, as we learn to cultivate and practice the skill of wise investigation of our mental and psychological states, instead of finding a me who's orchestrating our experience, thinking or planning or strategizing or worrying, we see underlying conditioned activities of the deeply rooted and familiar process itself that actually generates the sense of me."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "For example, we see judging, strategizing or planning, speculating and proliferating."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "This kind of wise attending allows our awareness to rest in a peaceful sense of letting go of release."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "So when we practice self-acceptance in our meditation, we simply notice our thoughts and our emotions."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "It allows us to see what we take to be ourselves for what it really is."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "It's a process, a process of impulses, of thoughts, of reactions and an endless river."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "This is an undeniable truth."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "If we can learn to accept this, we release our mistaken belief that an abiding permanent self can be found in the process of dependent arising."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Each one of us has agency and we have the power to make a difference."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Compassion is equality that expresses a self acceptance."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "When things occur and they do for all of us every day in our lives, that trigger us and send us into a state of reactivity or a state of disorientation."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "I don't want to make it sound as though this is something that you can simply hear or read about or think about once or twice."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "And this quality of equanimity allows us to actually be with what mindfulness is reporting."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "And that's where compassion shows up, even if we can't, even if we don't feel better, the simple seeing of what's happening is acceptance."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "I can't tell you how much I appreciate it."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "I feel like does anyone even care anymore about anything, you know, sometimes, and I know that that's not true."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Cindy, thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "We can change our relationship to the way that we are with the world."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "And I don't have a simple answer to that."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "You see, I might notice that I am anxious, or that I am upset about that, or that I'm rejecting the experience of not being with my breath and judging myself."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Well, if you can, if you can take the instruction of just going back to the breath, then by all means just go back to the breath."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "You see, whatever is happening, so if you're being, if a hindrance is arising, and you see that a hindrance is arising and you can let it go, then by all means let it go and go back to the breath."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Sometimes I find, and I'm really, maybe I'm just asking from your experience whether you ever do this or whether you think it's not helpful."}
{"prompt": "Self-Acceptance Can Be Learned", "completion": "Some people go for a walk."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "So to have that sense of the vast interconnectedness that exists among all of us is a very important influence in how we live our life."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And we're reluctant to let them go."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "Or, you know, whatever metaphor comes up for you that will help you spot it and drop it."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "I noticed somewhere in the early years of my practice that I was."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And what I found out was that no matter how much approval I got from outside, it didn't count if I was not able to appreciate myself and to be willing to be who I am."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "Wow, the rest of my life is just a gift."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And so naturally, gratitude arises when you realize you've been given a gift that you appreciate so much."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "A third grader must be about eight, I suppose."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "This was one I was unfamiliar with and when she read the first line, it just immediately struck me."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "It says in the metasuta, this is what should be accomplished by the one who is wise, who seeks the good and has obtained peace."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "So should one cherish all living things, suffusing love over the entire world, above, below, and all around without limit."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "But when he came back, he led these marches all over Cambodia at the risk of his life."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And continue expanding our metapractice until we can include wishing well-being and loving kindness for those who are very difficult for us to include."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "I'm here because the waters of the ocean evaporate and rain on us and provide moisture which supports our life."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "I know to cultivate loving kindness constantly in all ways in every way is a great aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "Yes, I agree that that loving the world is is you have to first stop start by not hating."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "If you're calling them an idiot, you know, you have to find a way of talking to, if you want to actually change somebody's mind, you have to talk to them in a way that respects them."}
{"prompt": "Wise Effort", "completion": "And when I met Suzuki Roshi, I felt he knows, he knows what happened there."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "But in ritual it's often nice to find a space, a place, a time that is appropriate for you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "If it's a person, maybe a picture, if it's something else, maybe it could be a stone that represents it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "And so the next thing is to say a little bit about the story."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "Sometimes it's the strong grieving and crying that other people have trouble with."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "Sometimes grief comes along with anger, and sometimes that seems inappropriate to be angry."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (4 of 5) Rituals for Grief", "completion": "And it's a ritual sometimes that can be done very well alone, sometimes with a trusted friend, sometimes with a spiritual teacher if you have someone to do it with, and hopefully you'll experience that this is that deep way of respecting the value and importance of grief in our life."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And it comes from the idea that a chariot, a war chariot, a war chariot in ancient India was mostly just wheel, because the wheel would place you stand, you go with your sword or your bow or something."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And one was that he was either going to become a wheel-turning monarch, or he was going to become a renunciant, a spiritual seeker who renounced the world, kind of a monk."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "In a sense, rather than conquering India, he conquered himself."}

{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Engaging this truth is what innobles a human being."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It seems like it's permanent, but in some ways it's either gotten frozen or locked in there, or we're continually refueling it and feeding it over and over again just days in place."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Things arise because of causes, and when the causes disappear, those things go away."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "When those causes go away, those sees."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But the Buddha was pointing to the possibility that you can go all the way."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "You can really do this work and somehow purify the heart, the mind from these irritants, and so the dukkha doesn't arise."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But suffering is a kind of very strong meaning, and it's not really adequate for translating dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The first duty or the first activity in relationship to the Four Noble Truths is the instruction to understand suffering, to study it, to get to know it really well."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And relax deeper and deeper, let go more and more thoroughly."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Some sufferings, there's a kind of one-to-one correlation."}

{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Okay, I'm suffering on Ferrari, that's silly."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "But why do I keep desiring these cars, these fancy cars? And they looked more carefully, it was, oh, you know what? Now that I notice, I want these cars because then I think I'm going to be the hottest meditation teacher in California."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So the desire for the car is not the root, that's the branch."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing the neck, shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so sometimes the attention or the awareness may be kind of just resting with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "There's not much sound we can be with the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Curious about how the body lets us know it's here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And the habit of the mind is to think."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so in the moment when you notice or you remember, rather than yanking yourself back to the breath or something you were paying attention to before, see if there can be a curiosity of, well, what's here now? What is the mind waking up with? Often there's some kind of a thought."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Notice it, oh, there's an emotion, there's some frustration that came in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes after the mind has been wandering off in thought or drifting off, the experience when we remember the effect that seems to be happening is that there is more calm, more ease."}

{"prompt": "Being Your Own Teacher Pt1 - Working With the Inner Critic", "completion": "We so much have this self-critical voice, almost like this sub-personality, this voice inside of us that's constantly putting us down or belittling us, or maybe this voice of negativity or self-judgment or blaming ourselves or nagging at us or having this sense of shame for what we are or the shame for how we are."}

{"prompt": "Being Your Own Teacher Pt1 - Working With the Inner Critic", "completion": "This is a subtle question."}
{"prompt": "Being Your Own Teacher Pt1 - Working With the Inner Critic", "completion": "There might be for us this quiet subtext like, okay, how can I beat myself up, so I do these things I'm supposed to be doing or something, right? And some of the things that I talk about, I'm going to talk about, it would be so easy for this self-critical voice to kind of rear its head and for us to get activated by it."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (4 of 5) Values We Live By", "completion": "And what the benefit of that is that no matter what the purpose is and the really sense of getting behind it and having some dedication to it, as meditation deepens, it kind of blossoms out into all these different dimensions of our life."}

{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And so during the breaks, if you're shy or if, you know, whatever reason you'd rather write down your question, we'll try and deal with those as well."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "But yes, sometimes we're talking on the car and the way here, you know, sometimes the whole idea of what is it like to be a Buddhist monk or nun living outside of Asia or even being a Buddhist monk or, you know, American Buddhist monk or nun living in Asia, you know, there's questions we wouldn't predict because it's our life."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And this then really became more solidified over periods of many hundreds of years."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "At the time the Chinese pilgrims were coming to India, the type of Buddhism that they brought back to China was Mahayana Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "It doesn't, it doesn't, sorry to interrupt, but just to clarify, Mahayana means the greater vehicle, which is I think a polite, very nice term, polite, but sometimes in the older texts, the Buddhist texts, you find the term Hiniyana, so Hiniyana, the word Hina in Pali refers to, it means base, vulgar, it doesn't mean lesser."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So there never was a tradition or sect called the Hiniyana, you know, so we are the, we are the base vulgar ones."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "Nowadays, and I really like this, and Anjan just alluded to it, his Holiness the Dalai Lama recently wrote a book called One Teacher, Many Traditions, I think is the name of it, something like that, where he's really goes into a lot of detail about just the, the distinctions between the two traditions."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And he prefers the terminology, the Pali tradition and the Sanskrit tradition, because then that really goes back to, you know, the, the original text, the language of the original text."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And even when you talk about northern and southern tradition, well, now we've got Australia, Europe and North America."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So people have been trying with this language and lately, nowadays, I've adopted his Holiness the Dalai Lama, Sanskrit tradition, Pali tradition, because it really refers to kind of the root text that the tradition came from."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "Somebody, the other day, somebody was giving a talk and they said incorrectly that the Tibetan tradition began in China, right? And maybe they're saying that because politically now, you know, Tibet was invaded by China."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And also around the same time, there were kind of the flourishing of what we call the Mahasiddhas or the great kind of yogic masters too."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And then he thought, oh, that made her really happy."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So anyway, just a little background of where that comes from."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And even though people would travel, there would be pilgrims traveling, there wasn't a lot of interaction."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "Oh, where did we go from here? Okay."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So it was, it was just a beautiful example of like what it's starting to look like."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "For decades, people of the, well, wherever Buddhism has gone historically, it will take on the flavor of the local culture."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "But then people say, well, what's American Buddhism going to look like? You know, as if we should try to create it."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "But the reality is it, this is it."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "And so human nature is still very much prone to attachment and, and even attachment to the teachings."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "They're gone like, whoa, how could they have that attitude that's so narrow minded or this or that and the other."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So they have, they might have incredible wisdom in terms of the Dharma, incredible compassion, like all of these great qualities and still, you know, our product of their culture and what they've learned, whether they've learned, you know, and it goes both ways too, because a lot of times the, the, you know, from Theravada, they say, oh, you guys aren't even Buddhists, like your Vajrayana isn't even Buddhism, like what are you, you just made this stuff up."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "So he, you know, it's like off the radar completely."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "He sat down and explained to him."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "I mean there are, there are Theravadans and Tibetan masters that if they did meet they would just reinforce each other's perceptions of each other you know and so that happens as well."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "We should break maybe after this question yeah we'll take a break after this other question."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "But I don't know much or almost nothing about how in Vajrayana students talk to direct your mind during meditation."}
{"prompt": "Theravada and Vajrayana - Part 1", "completion": "I've heard stories about visualizing deities and I don't really know anything so that's my question how do you teach people to direct your mind during meditation in Vajrayana? And I can answer that briefly now you know just to give kind of an overview and I think so in addition in the Tibetan tradition we do have focusing sometimes we call it focusing meditation where you focus on an object in order to develop your focus and concentration."}

{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "And how does one take that step? What's the guide? There's a lot of thinking, competing values in terms of choices about spending time with friends, helping somebody else, working on the environment."}
{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "And what's the step that guides that? How what's the thinking from non-thinking to thinking that will."}

{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "And emptiness allows for that space, but whenever I'm sort of teaching or thinking of Buddhist things, it always gets very, it gets both simple and convoluted because everything is connected, if you see what I mean."}
{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "In fact, one of the first Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha goes through the ways that the ordinary man contemplates man, sorry, woman, of course it was always the man there, contemplates the four elements, fire, water, earth and air."}

{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "I think such an admonition to see what is not there, but what remains is one that should be really carefully considered when in any discussion of emptiness."}

{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "But one side of the coin is emptiness."}
{"prompt": "How Empty is Emptiness (part 1)", "completion": "And therefore what was left, the form of what was there but is emptied out becomes meaningful and therefore is part of the content of emptiness."}

{"prompt": "Conditions at Work in the World", "completion": "And so I think in some ways maybe it's more in the Western Buddhist tradition that we talk so much about the meditation and kind of think it's separate from our community, separate from our engagement with each other."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "Greetings, greetings, and welcome Dharma Wayfarers."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "So just to say a couple of words about it before we get into the practice together."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "And simply what it can be experienced as, it really seems is described simply as noticing any experience, any object that arises in experience, any object, object of sight, sound, sensations, objects of thought, any object that arises in experience, the mind perceives it with Vedana."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "The mind perceives it with either a sense of pleasant, unpleasant, near pleasant, nor unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "So every object in the experience, in our experience that's perceived, that's touched by consciousness, that needs, that's met by consciousness, always is perceived as either pleasant, unpleasant, or, since I don't want to say neither pleasant nor unpleasant, I'll just say neutral, but the Pali is neither pleasant nor unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "How are they perceived? So not just perceiving, noticing what object shows up, just recognizing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "No need to analyze why it's showing up."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone (vedana)", "completion": "Notice if there are any thoughts arising, maybe thoughts of judgment."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And I really wanted to discover, what did the Buddha actually have to say about mindfulness? What did he actually say about practicing mindfulness? And the word, the Pali word is sati, S-A-T-I."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And as I went through it, I was surprised, actually a little shocked, that how little he actually says about mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And then, as I said yesterday morning, there was a section beginning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "It says, going to a forest, root of a tree, empty building, sitting cross-legged, body upright, and establishing mindfulness to the forefront."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "I thought, what does this mean? And as I started looking through the text of the Buddha, there's nothing in his teachings that would be comparable to the English expression, be mindful."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "So if a farmer cultivates a plant, the farmer is not doing the growing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And so the sati is not associated with an activity of doing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And so the instructions, the verbs of things that we're doing are the first thing that's talked about is to know."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "The text also talks about observing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "Partly because we have this wave of the mindfulness movement going through the modern world."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "It makes us busy, exactly."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And then I put my glasses down, and then I continue talking, and then I get up to go to the bathroom and get some tea and come back."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "We're just there with that, as if we're present to know it well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "And she would come back with the same or different reply."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (2) Knowing in a New Way", "completion": "I'm trying to convey to you that this idea of the specialness of knowing that to attend to so that we know it something in a deeper way."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "So we're now continuing to talk about the third foundation of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And so we're making a shift, this journey from one into the other as we deepen the practice."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "When the mind is no longer focused on objects, these objects in this kind of narrow, constricted, or forceful way, then the mind goes through a transition sometimes where it's a little bit confused."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "It's not quite sure what to focus on or what to do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And so without greed, hate, and delusion, sometimes it's deflation, sometimes it's scatterness of mind, restlessness of the mind that can happen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "There's not a preference for one thing over another."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And so here we begin this journey now into more spiritual states or dharma states, whereas greed, hate and delusion, those mind states, are not particularly dharmic, not dharmic at all."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "One, there's a little bit of a personal connection to that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipaṭṭhāna (41) Knowing the Expanded Mind", "completion": "And the way to do it is that on the What's New page, on the home page of IMC's website, there's a section in the bottom right called What's New, and there there's a notice about fundraising for the Ukraine."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And the fourth category, which is today, is that of restlessness and worry, restlessness and regret."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "The mind can be so incredibly restless."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Sitting quietly meditating."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Everything's nice and wonderful, maybe."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Maybe I don't know why it's called monkey mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "So monkey mind is a mind that thinks one thing and then immediately grabs for the next thought."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "It's said that one of the very important aspects of restlessness and worry is to learn to recognize it, see that it's there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Or the discomfort of restlessness creates an outward looking."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And so there might be some reason, maybe having paid your taxes in ten years."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "No, you don't need meditation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Because in the ancient tradition, regret was defined as regret, being agitated because of regretting what you did and didn't do in the past."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "That doesn't make any sense."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And meditation shouldn't be the solution, shouldn't be the escape."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And so sometimes we need to address the deep held identity that we have, the way we hold ourselves and think about ourselves."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And maybe some of you have built up that television muscle and, you know, have the fortitude and the capacity of sitting there calm and upright and straight and, you know, stable and just watch that tube."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And I just, it isn't that I'm, you know, trouble with what I see, but it's flickering somehow."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But it's just somehow that activity seems to kind of makes my mind kind of agitated."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Or for some people, you know, for me, sometimes not getting enough sleep."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And to say that be very focused, really use your attention to stay really centered on one thing."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And sometimes when all the attention, all the energy of attention goes towards one thing, there's not much, you know, kind of you pour it into one thing, then there's not much energy left to feed the restlessness."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But if I just kind of evoke calm, think about calm, calm, sometimes that becomes available and that can kind of settle the whole thing."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And it's considered to be one of the great supports of meditation practice in Buddhism is to cultivate contentment."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And having a regular routine that you kind of settle into can support some people from."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But a very important movement working with all the hindrances is to learn to turn the attention away from what it's focused on objectively."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Is there a connection between physical pain and restlessness? Is that a manifestation of restlessness? Sure."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And so sometimes it's not good to sit with pain if you can avoid it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Some people have health conditions where it's very hard, but chronic pain can be agitating."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And I want to hear what you're saying."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "But one of the things that occurs to me is that there's a beautiful practice in mindfulness of tracking our emotional life, which means this, that there's almost like there's layers of emotionality."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Just stay very, very present and allow it to be there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Just hold it there in a respectful way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And to be in a peaceful state where you're actually able to stay with a thought for an extended period."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "Just that way, that relating will make us restless."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry", "completion": "And so now in this particular society it's defined as a disorder, but in different societies it's relative."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "To have mind thinking can have stress connected to it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "So as we sit today, and today we'll just most sit now and I finish speaking in silence, but see if you can find, either through memory or through some hints or some clear connection, a reference point for a state of mind that is beneficial, is valuable to rest in."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "A state of mind where thinking does not become obsessive."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "Thinking becomes calm and quiet."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "So whatever it might be for you, some reference point, and keep that reference point close by."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "What switch has your mind prioritized? And might it have been possible for you to have more prioritized tuning in, being attuned to the place where the mind is peaceful? And one of the advantages of doing this is that the peaceful mind is the mind through which it's easier to have non-reactive goodwill, a love which is generous but not needy, a compassion which cares but is not troubled."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: The Mind at Peace", "completion": "And may we have a state of mind from which we can contribute to that as a possibility."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The teaching is how we establish mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The word often used foundation sounds like something more of a noun, the foundations of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And to me, that's more descriptive of what's being offered in the Satipattana Sutta is activities that will support the establishment of this quality of mind."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So the capacity of being aware of what's happening in the present moment in and of itself is a neutral quality."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And that's what we are exploring."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And I think it's amazing that he discovered this very, it's always a very ordinary part of our minds."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There's a lot going on in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But the third foundation is much simpler."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "When, and then it understands a mind unaffected by greed as a mind unaffected by greed."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this curiosity about what's happening in the mind in this simple way is greed or aversion present or absent."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "If you follow the impulse of aversion, then you'll be okay."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And that's what we've been led by for most of our lives before we meet this practice are those impulses."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And that's a part of why they hook us, because we do in that moment kind of get that little sense of, ah, okay, I'm fine."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And that recognition, being aware of that, this present moment experience of greed, this present moment experience of aversion, helps the mind to realize, to let go, that letting go of greed and aversion might be away."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so I think in this third foundation, it's a real, just a simple understanding of what is greed? How does it affect the mind? What is aversion? How does it affect the mind? What is delusion? How does it affect the mind? This is kind of the central piece to how wise mindfulness, this kind of mindfulness that is curious about present moment experience, how wise mindfulness is transformative that we don't need to necessarily make something happen."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And there are other places where the Buddha does point to strategies for navigating it."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But in this instruction on establishing mindfulness, the Buddha is really pointing to just, can you be aware of what's happening in this moment? And if not, if that the power, the motivation, or the kind of momentum we could say, if the momentum of what's happening is stronger than our capacity to be present for it, there are other teachings that support how to navigate that, how to let go, how to redirect the attention, things like that."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Greed or aversion, and there's a sense of, oh, that's what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And we realize or see that we don't have to be afraid of the greed or aversion when it's held in the mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Just greed, aversion, delusion, contraction, distraction."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "We don't have to identify in particular the specific emotion that's present."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It's like, oh, what the job description of aversion is, is to separate us, to separate us from something that's unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Thoughts about what's going on and the feelings of, you know, wanting to lash out, all of that."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "What is the relationship? So that we could say would be a kind of a directing or kind of a curiosity about this third foundation."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And a little bit of that description I gave around greed and aversion, the delusion that's embedded in greed and aversion."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The energy, the delusion of aversion doesn't understand that the energy of compassion can take care of us."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So the presence and absence of delusion is quite startling when it falls away."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And any thoughts or comments about what I've shared? Oh, let me make it possible for you to unmute yourselves."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And I found myself in sitting, asking that question and the answer being, yeah, I'm fine."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I'm going to be, you know, it's like if I don't hold on to that raft, I may get swept away by the current."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I clung to my mindfulness when I was looking at self hatred."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Holding onto this mindfulness is helping me not to be swept, you know, not to lose the raft in the middle of the river, basically."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "You know, actually, you know, use the raft, not holding onto it, but kind of resting on it."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "You know, when you're holding on really tight to that raft and there's no like current, you'll start noticing the ache of the hands and the struggle there to hold on."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so we see the difference."}
{"prompt": "Aware of the Presence and Absence of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But that's how the practice works."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "I'm very sorry to have been interrupting you when you read out the bio, because this is, I think this is at least three or four years old, in between things have been changing, or things always change."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And personally, I feel very touched coming here and seeing the interest of people like you, the interest in the Dharma, in the possibility that it brings into our lives, the possibility of change in regards to bringing more depth and more reflection, contemplation and direct experience into this."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "I think otherwise you would not be here."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "We do experience suffering in ways of painful physical experiences, through illnesses, through physical weaknesses and we do experience suffering in terms of painful emotional experiences."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "It's the same like when you say, well, actually, there is only right now this moment."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "So what is, is only where we are right now."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "You just don't want to face up to that."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "Instead of keeping a certain distance of cutting it out, of rejecting it, we actually open the heart towards it and allow it to touch us."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "You allow it to touch you deeper."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And using wisdom in the way that you also know, okay, this is as much as I can take right now."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And I think this is actually what you are doing here, by coming together, practicing as a lay sangha together."}
{"prompt": "Sharing Practice", "completion": "And discovering that actually I am not just freeing myself from suffering, I do share suffering while I am doing step by step more out of it."}

{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "So there's letting go, there's abandoning, there's shedding, there's casting off."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And so it isn't so much that letting go is being championed as it's better than the alternative."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And to see that then letting go becomes more interesting because we see the Buddha once said that for all the emphasis he gave on things like letting go, he said, I don't teach you to let go of everything at any time."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "There can be two people who have, perhaps in Buddhist practice, maybe even a profound letting go, a profound release or experience of liberation."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "Something has changed now that makes me understand myself, my life, priorities in a very different way."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And vusagha also means to relax."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "To let go deep enough to no longer have that veil and filter, and be able to see through the space that's been created of the absence of clinging or the absence of preoccupation is not an easy thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And so then we lose touch with it, but it's right there on our shoulder sitting there waiting for us."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "I'm the one being practiced by the freedom or the space."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "I understand in the long line at the supermarket, the back of it, I chose the wrong line."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "All you have to do is tighten up a little bit to realize it's still there."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And I would say intelligence as well."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And then this emphasis today is that I really want to stress."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "That's one of the important tasks of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And maybe there are bigger kind of letting goes."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "And then when we're over with big distraction, we realize that some of our big things that we're upset about or concerned with are no longer there."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "So as soon as you notice that, you're, oh, I better rush back and pick it up."}
{"prompt": "Liberation and Freedom", "completion": "So we might not see it or know it, but actually there's more absence around you and in you than you could possibly imagine."}

{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "Or I put it in relationships."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "It's based in a misperception that there is something out there in the material world, in the realm of relationship or in the realm of my capacity to choose and to do."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "We might think there's nothing reliable."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "There's an ease and a peace that's possible."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And I would say kind of aligning ourselves with this truth of impermanent, unreliable, not resisting that truth."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And it's a different kind of safety too that I think that we think, right? You know, we think of safety as being able to shore things up and keep things the way we want them to."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "Maybe somebody will understand."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "But the experience, and this is maybe partly why the Buddha said it's so subtle."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "But there's also a way that we can kind of take refuge in the teachings that the Buddha taught, which is kind of his laying out."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "Here's the set of things that are helpful."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "We don't initially don't have any sense, at least for myself."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "So there was a kind of a sense of initially taking a kind of a refuge in the possibility for some kind of reduction of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "Or when we're not able to really bring that sense of awareness."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "Yeah, I don't need to try to get rid of this anger."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "And as the practice goes on, it moves."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "In that moment, we are not looking for refuge."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in Awareness?", "completion": "That is what inspires us to practice."}
{"prompt": "Reflection on Mortality: The Poignancy of Being Alive", "completion": "And I thought today I would reflect on mortality and the poignancy of being alive."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "We're not quite sure how to translate some of these words."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "And so these four slices of the human pie that the Buddha uses is to experience things through the vantage point of our physical embodied experience, to experience it from the vantage point of the subjective experience, the subjective feeling of whether things are pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Emotions (1 of 5) Introduction", "completion": "And then the third pie piece is the state of the mind, both the motivational state of the mind, what drives us to be involved in the world or the orientation we have towards the world and activity."}

{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "You see this in, the Buddha was not the kind of person who would go around and pick fights with people."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "For instance, if you believe that everything you experience in the present moment is determined by the past, you're not going to think about, well what should I change to do because the present moment is a given."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And so you have to be very careful about what questions or frames you give because if you've got the wrong puzzle or another analogy would be a machine."}

{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And he realizes, OK, this is the wrong path."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "For example, one of the first questions you're hearing in Buddha's 101 all the time, again, if there is no self, then who does actions and who receives the result of actions? That's taking the teaching on Anata as a foundational teaching and the questions of karma would have to fit into this teaching."}

{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "That's why he declares these teachings."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Because we're primarily active, so we need instructions on how to act."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "It's a kind of mental action, clinging, craving."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "And you get the impression that Rahula probably told a lie that day, because the first issue the Buddha brings up is, if a person who tells an intentional lie with no sense of shame, there's no good to them."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "Over the long term, what were the results? And if you saw that you did not cause any harm, he said, take joy in the fact that you're getting better on the path."}
{"prompt": "Skill in Questions - Part 1", "completion": "So it's not just you stewing about your actions, but you get some advice."}

{"prompt": "Improvisation and the Messiness of Experience", "completion": "And the risk is that practice, it can start to feel a little like pretend, yeah? Do you know those moments when it feels like practice is like a little pretending? And we want to really get sensitive to that sense of pretending, yeah? It's almost like we're performing our meditation for an audience, even though maybe that audience is just you, yeah? Or we're performing for some kind of internalized sense of what, of the teacher or the Buddha or something, yeah? But there's a sense of like, we're performing for an audience in a certain way."}

{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "These understandings, or we could say the recognition of experience as impermanent, unreliable, not self."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And that being an understanding and insight into that might be that we've heard teachings about impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So sometimes these understandings come as direct experiential wisdom, knowing, pointing to a kind of a release of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Our experience, conditioned experience, the arising of sight, of sound, of smell, of taste, of touch, thoughts in the mind, emotions, moods, ideas, beliefs, all are risings, have the nature of being impermanent, unreliable, and not self."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "I am of the nature to die."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "All that is mine, beloved and pleasing, will become otherwise, will become separated from me."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "You can use it in many ways."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Now, this is not the insight into impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And, you know, we had a little bucket to work with."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And sometimes I looked up and the pile was gone."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And then when I looked up and it wasn't there, that bubble of delusion was burst."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Like the mind sees it had been attributing that for us."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And, and actually I, I appreciate sometimes reflecting on this level of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "Human species is impermanent."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And so reflecting on the vast scales of impermanent remembering, remembering that."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "My partner, my parents, my siblings of the nature to age, sicken and die, that can have a very profound effect on the heart."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And there's maybe we could say a deeper level of impermanence or a subtler level of impermanence, more moment to moment level of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "There's no thing there at all."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "And this can start to be seen through the meditative mind."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "This description of experience, feelings, thoughts, perceptions understood as they arise, persist and pass away."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "We haven't seen the thing pass away, or the experienced pass away necessarily there, but then sometime later we might recognize, wow, that thing that I was so hooked on, it's gone now."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "That's a kind of a, we could say it's a kind of a signpost or a kind of a a warning flare that says, hey, you know, delusions happening, some things being clung to, some things being misattributed here."}
{"prompt": "The Perception of Impermanence", "completion": "So let's just sit for a moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Breathing in short, one understands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Breathing out short, one understands."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "And then it says one trains to experience the whole body while breathing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "If the mind wanders or when the mind wanders."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Feeling insensitive to the body, my exploration of this, allowing the bubble to broaden."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Maybe that bubble can expand a little bit further, taking more of the body, relaxing, receiving, breathing insensitive to the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Maybe some of the sensations experienced in the body don't seem connected to the breathing and that's okay, it's kind of this tracking of knowing, breathing in and breathing out, the breath like a candle in the middle of a room, the sensitivity to the body like the awareness that the light of the candle lights up the room."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Whole Body Breathing", "completion": "Breathing out sensitive to the body."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And so this third foundation really points to recognizing the presence or absence of these three."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "The greed wouldn't exist without delusion."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "There's a belief in there that that's going to do it for me."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "Again, you know, based in a delusion that something else needs to be happening in order to be happy."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "That restlessness can be based in a kind of a desire for some things, just anything to like make me have a hit of some kind of pleasure and kind of based in greed."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "We may notice a kind of a pulled in and not really know, is it greed, is it aversion? But it's a kind of, it's almost like a highlight."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "There's some kind of delusion present, distracted similarly, when the mind is kind of jumping around and not able to stabilize or land, you know, it's like that can be distracted mind and delusion is present."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "There's a difference, we know mindfulness is here."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So there is in that moment of mindfulness returning, there's the knowing what's here now, but there's also a lingering memory of what it was like a few moments before."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "We are beings that are shaped by our views and then to recognize, well, what are the views that are operating here? And how have those views been shaped? Especially when we butt up against people who have different views than we are, and be really useful to take stock of, well, okay, these are my views."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So just even simply recognizing a view or belief is operating is a very different, again, it's similar to what I said earlier around noticing that greed is happening is very different than being led by greed."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "Often we just go through our lives without noticing there's kind of the inherent kind of possibility of suffering connected to a view, we're just operating as if it's true."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "So this kind of delusion, it seems kind of connected with our human body and mind, in a way, that we take what is impermanent to be permanent is just the way our system works, that we attribute solidity to things."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And maybe also helpful in some way in our evolution, that the experience of stability feels safe."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And it's just the nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "Greed and aversion are not okay with things as they are."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "But it's not what we take it to be."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And so, you know, noticing that relationship."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "And so, we begin to learn in a way that these relationships are extra, you know, that the disturbance or the frustration or the challenge around impermanent, unreliable in particular, that it is, it's just a belief in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "You know, so, so, but that, that having seen the delusion fall away and then recognizing, wow, I'm caught in this belief again that it's a problem, but having seen that there was like even a few seconds where it wasn't, now we can really start to know this is delusion operating."}
{"prompt": "Different Kinds of Delusion", "completion": "That alignment with, that's what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And one of the principles that I'm going to offer is the principle that sometimes what is unpleasant can be overcome by what is pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And I can't really make progress in the Dharma or something because it's preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And back in ancient India in the Buddha's time there was other religious traditions that saw this as well, that sensual pleasures of all kinds were an obstacle to some kind of spiritual progress."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "So people who live with constant threat growing up can be conditioned to be afraid and anxious."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "There are people who have been horribly wounded, scarred emotionally by what happens to them."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Some people receive the conditioning that you're successful if you have a lot of pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "They don't have any other time in their life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But then his wife had a baby and he couldn't spend the weekend away on his motorcycle."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And she would bring in a tray with toast, butter and cheese on it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Something deeper was born, it was awoken, it was allowed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And, you know, he didn't have Netflix."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "So I'll give you an example for me."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Like sometimes I sit down, I've had a busy day doing a lot of things or something or a lot of feelings, a lot of something going on."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Something that kind of belongs more to the wellspring that we allow for, that we open up to."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But the fact that you just were in the park with a friend and going for a nice walk and feeling kind of peaceful, that's besides the point once you get in your car to go to the next important thing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "If we get preoccupied with our unhappiness, we're going to be probably more likely influenced by the unhappiness in a negative way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "So what are some of the things that we can feel? Some of it is a global awareness of the body that's bigger than any particular place where we feel uncomfortable or feel pain in the body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "It's like, wow, they don't have any space."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And so to feel the spaciousness within for me has a positive conditioning force."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "I say that very carefully in all those words because I could have said when we just get concentrated on one thing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "But to say concentrated, some people then get fixated, this tight attention."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "Some of you might have the craft you do, where you could say, yeah, I'm absorbed in the craft, but you're not fixating on any one part of the craft."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "We don't have to ignore the difficulties we have, but we can hold them in a different context than one that's held by being fixated on it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "If I feel tense in my body, it feels uncomfortable, I can relax attention."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And earlier in my life, I would have just kind of been caught by the impatience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And now breathe with the impatience."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "It's being held in a wider context."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "I keep using the word wellsprings because the Buddha in talking about this kind of absorption uses the metaphor analogy of an underground spring, underwater spring in a lake, a wellspring of water that flows into the lake from below."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "There's nothing inherently wrong with sensual pleasure and so in Buddhism we're not dismissing sensual pleasure offhand, it's the attachment to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "And as we feel this, so dismissing it or feeling that sensual pleasure is wrong doesn't allow us to see how they can operate together."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "So I wouldn't rule it out, but I'm not really encouraging people to lean into the pain."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "It might be that we should really bring careful attention to really feel it closely and intimately."}
{"prompt": "Dharmic Pleasure", "completion": "You know, I kind of feel like I just gave you a hot potato."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Allow yourself to arrive in this present moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "If we're telling our cells relax, relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What is awareness already aware of? What is being received? What is coming to you? Maybe body sensations or feeling tone of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "In fact, when I told my publisher how long it was looking, they thought, hmm, that's a long book."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "As Maureen said in the introduction, I've been meditating since 1980, so I wasn't new to meditation practice when I first became interested in developing deeper concentration."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And I thought, oh, I'll just start that one-year retreat by deepening concentration and developing what are called the jhanas, which are absorption states of deep concentration."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And I want to share a little bit about what this path of practice is, because during that retreat, a venerable Pao Aksayadau asked me multiple times to write a book."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "You could write about that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So we work with skill and relationship to the object."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "The second section looks at a range of concentration objects."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "I put them in context so you understand the purpose of the practice and how it fits in this path of liberation."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So you use your wisdom and your sensitivity as you're reading to see when you get to that section on instructions."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "I'm finding that so many of these practices are very, very directly applicable to the way that we perceive things in daily life and the way that we act and the choices that we make and how we can unravel the suffering that we might experience in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Now, I say easy, but that's maybe, maybe it's not true that it's easy."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But I have tremendous faith and confidence that when we're dedicated to the Dhamma, that we are putting those conditions in place."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "When they haven't yet come together, then it's even more important to be practicing, right, to keep putting those conditions together."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Because this practice is so profound, it really does go from distraction to release."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And I think that's what we all seek is some degree of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Or perhaps you've done some concentration practice or some insight practice and want to just ask a question about the development of your own path."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But that process happens very rapidly, so we can experience deep concentration even in our daily practice."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "Now the kinds of practices that I suggest, they really throughout this whole book, actually both books have so many kinds of suggestions."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But a lot of them look at how we work with distraction or how we hold our meditation object, how we relate to things."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "But it's not easy to maintain either."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "I don't think we always have to put forth that kind of effort, but it's an amazing thing to know that we can."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And sometimes in the afternoon, it's more often restlessness."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "You know, you may also have a few favorite hindrances that you've seen before and many, many times before."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So it's bringing a wise relationship to the experience, but first we have to know what that experience is."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And they just brush aside and then there'll be a period of time where no hindrance arises."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "As we get close to Jhana, the hindrance is just, they just don't arise."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And the mind starts to get purer and purer and clearer and clearer and brighter and brighter and more and more steady and stable on the chosen meditation object until it's possible for the mind to absorb within the meditation object."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "They can arise up until then, but they cannot arise then."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And equanimity is really important in this practice to allow the mind to be equanimous and equanimous with whatever is occurring in the practice so that we meet it and we respond skillfully with it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "We're not concentrated until we get into jhana."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So I see them as a sequel, although they're not exactly a sequel."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so I've had some people get first into genre with the other objects and then come back to refine the breath as an object to take it into genre."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "So people work differently with them, although we start with the breath as the object because we're all breathing."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And we have a kind of clarity of boundary around where our attention will go."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "It's part of what's part of the understanding of clear comprehension of what's called the clear comprehension of the domain of meditation."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "It really leads to a profound liberation that uproots greed, hate and delusion from its roots never to arise again."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Wide and Deep", "completion": "And so we have lots of insights along the way, and some moments are struggles, not everything is pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And I think in a way we all actually have a pretty abiding loyalty to our particular philosophy of happiness, to our model of what the good life is."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And one of the things that I think we find is that we have some faith that clinging is going to work."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And then the questioner went on to say you know that was ten years ago, you're ten years older, you've done ten more years of practice, of teaching how would you characterize freedom now? What would you say if you had to say it in one sentence? And Joseph said the mind that's not clinging to anything."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "So I'm making it very simple for you to save you from getting caught in incredible amounts of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "But instead I suggest being an earthworm letting go of the desire to radiate love throughout the world."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "You know, sometimes the Buddha's second noble truth, like desire is the cause of all suffering, it gets translated, the word tanha in Pali gets translated as desire."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Desire can be distinguished from craving and clinging insofar as desires can actually be fulfilled."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "I'm not dismissive of that."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "And so much of that time with sense pleasure, when we're reaching out towards sense pleasure, what we want more than the actual pleasure is the cessation of the clinging."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Maybe you know the sense at the end of a sitting sometimes, maybe it's been a relatively quiet sitting for you."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "We certainly are not in the mood to have a debate to convince somebody of what's true and what's not."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Our indiscriminate enjoyment of being right is matched by an almost equally indiscriminate feeling that we are right."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Most of us go through life assuming that we are basically right basically all the time about basically everything."}
{"prompt": "Clinging & Letting Go", "completion": "Oscar Wilde said the secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And there's a number of ways that we can think about Buddhist practice and I'm just going to offer one."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So, Buddhist practice, one part of this is cultivation, which we've been doing."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "I like to do this thought experiment and all kinds of things, but maybe I invite you to join me in this, but just imagine what the world would be like."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "But it takes effort to plant seeds."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And I might even say it's more powerful, because it has the flexibility, it can bend doesn't have the brittleness that sometimes something that blade my time or something like this."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "But we need both cultivation and letting go practices."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So this idea of your perfect."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And it's not uncommon for people to have a preference for one or the other."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So cultivation practices can be like a snake."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "But there's one thing that also I want to point to is that sometimes it doesn't make sense to let go."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Sometimes with Buddhist practices, we talk about the importance of letting go and to be sure letting go is important."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And certainly I'm reflecting back there was a time in my life when I was very much invested in this idea of myself as a scientist."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "So, sometimes when we feel like letting go, if we put something down, like to go with it, doesn't, there's, if we let go too early and we have nothing to replace it, that's how I should say it, then we can feel lost."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "As we find that we're able to touch into that."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And for me, sometimes when I'm trying to describe loving kindness."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And I find myself using kind of vague words."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And one of those vague words that I like to use is spaciousness."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "This abandoning, this releasing of greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Greed, hatred and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "Some of you will know these, this is the parames, this word parame, like the perfections is this related to this word of completeness or taking the furthest or highest date possible or perfection."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "I'm just going to list these parames, I'm not going to talk about all of them, but many of you are familiar with this list."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "These parames are, you know, a support for freedom."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "I have to cultivate because I don't have enough."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "It's more like just planting seeds."}
{"prompt": "The Two Practices of Cultivation and Letting go", "completion": "And to notice times when goodwill benevolence kindness just shows up, and you just find yourself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "So, there might be better examples for each of you, rather than what I came up with, but maybe it's something only we can experience for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "But as the practice deepens, a wise person, part of the reason a wise person is interested in the welfare of everyone, including oneself, is because in the direct experience of the moment, we see very clearly this ah and ouch."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "Because when we don't see the changing impermanent moving nature of reality, we're probably locked on in some way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "And maybe trying to think about how things, can things really be in constant and changing so much? When we start thinking about that, we've kind of removed ourselves from the experience, the directness, immediacy of what's changing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "How did your shift? How did the knowing move? The knowing moved, the knowing changed."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (5 of 5) To Be Known Personaly by the Wise", "completion": "Trusting that, finding that, being that, is this art of this dhamma that the Buddha is talking about."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Relaxing the body is very supportive to help the mind to release a little bit, to relax a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "There is a little bit of doing in the practice of mindfulness but it can be a really light touch."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Just enough attention to connect with what's arising right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Connecting to this experience of living, of being alive."}

{"prompt": "Breath Focus Pt. 1", "completion": "So you give up focusing on the breath for a while and get interested in untangling and unblocking and de identifying with mental image, mental talk and emotional body sensation that's pulling you away from the breath."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "Often it can be, and I'm not pointing an accusatory finger at anybody, often these bland overlay of the way that we interpret it in contemporary practice, which is we come up with a nice list because that's what Westerners are used to, a nice list of things that says don't do this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 2", "completion": "And actually, as a layperson, there was always distinction in Indian society and the way it was portrayed in Indian society, they just had to look even more closely at their ethics than, say, the monastic, because the monastic has these 227 rules that they have to engage in, and they have the constant scrutiny of the other monks around them who often will critique them."}

{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I walk up and step nearly on a rattlesnake, and there's the snake rattling at me like two feet away."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And it's like, there's fear, but there's also immediate presence."}

{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "You know, when I saw that happen, it was like, I just watched my body do its thing, which was to slowly back up."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So that's not the kind of fear I'm going to talk about tonight."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So this is an interesting thing to notice that fear can arise based on thought, usually some kind of thought about the future."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I also find anxiety can arise around, I don't know, overwhelm or a feeling of way too much to do."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "You're not sure about what's going to happen."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Then the definition of worry in the dictionary said it includes excessive pondering, excessive thinking."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "This is what happens in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "We don't recognize them just as, oh, this is a thought happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It thinks a thought, and then it proliferates on it, and that proliferation then we react to even more."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So that's much of the process of how this emotion happens for us."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So that's one really helpful way, especially if you're seeing a lot of thoughts around a pattern of fear or worry or anxiety, see if you can ground your attention in the body and consciously let go of thoughts whenever you find yourself pulled back."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "There's probably a little bit of thinking happening there, but I think largely it's that there's kind of been a direct sense wiring almost because of a traumatic situation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "If that's the way it goes, then I'll do that."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "That's all happening in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And so one of the things that I've really begun to appreciate is that when my mind starts projecting out and starts thinking, well, what if, what if, what if, what if, how, you know, things about how to control the future."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "With a bit of that ability or that capacity to be with the physical experience."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And when we can take a step back, turn our attention to the body."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So it allows us to bring in some of that wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's just a passing phenomenon."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Sometimes we find ourselves afraid of our fear or resistant to fear."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I mean, so, you know, if you find yourself resistant to fear, like there's fear coming up and trying to pay attention to it."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "You think, okay, fear's coming up, I'm supposed to pay attention to that."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "But be with what is actually happening, which is the resistance."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "What am I afraid of? Well, I'm afraid of this, this thing."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Because much of the reason fear comes about is because life is out of our control."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "We see things being out of control and we're afraid."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "The fact that things are out of control is a truth."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And at some point it's like, wait a minute."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's like, well, there's that fear, I've got to get rid of it."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "But in the middle of that whole process was this wish for safety, which was a wholesome wish."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And connecting to that brought some ease, brought some freedom."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And again, this is a truth."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It's true that we don't know what our next moment will be."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "But the positive path has its own downfalls as well."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So the so-called positive is often trying to construct control also in its own way."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "So to begin to recognize, oh, that story, what's actually happening? What's happening here right now? And body is always present."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "It still feels like it's real."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "And yet there's a whole different area or domain from which we can gather information about how we are around that situation."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "Does that make sense? Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Transforming Fear", "completion": "I can open my eyes and be with being in this room."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "I was invited to give a talk, and I gave a talk at the Unity Church in Palo Alto."}

{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "I think sometimes it's a very respectful way of being with maybe the impossible."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Somewhere or other I came, I remember in my head a quote that goes something like, in the silence there's a sound, the sound of flapping bird wings."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And you might have had the experience in your life of being at some place where the silence was very pronounced or very strong or you're kind of absorbed in the silence or engaged in it."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "So for example, in Japanese flower arrangements, sometimes in certain places, they'll have just one flower."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "The new way can be quite revealing."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And you can kind of watch that kind of moving through."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Hermonese kind of called it a stream, right? A river, to sit out there, sit out on the river and watch the river of life going by."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And to kind of notice that and watch that things arise and things pass, suddenly they're there, they weren't there before and they're gone."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And I was kind of happy about going there and curious what was going to be like to be in new place, new people and curious about what it would be like to talk to people."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Because the car just hadn't just burned because then the car was kind of intact."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And not just pass it by quickly to check that off, that's interesting or something, but really kind of let it impact me."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And so, but one of the reasons why in meditation, why it's important to begin seeing that, and why it gets seen and highlighted in meditation is that it turns out that having some deep insight into these three things is a means, a vehicle to liberating the mind."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "All created things are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And that's the level that's available to everybody and they live their lives."}

{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And now it seems like it's just around the corner."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "Sometimes children are surprised."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "We kind of see ourselves in certain ways."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "There's a possibility in the human heart of finding a kind of presence or a kind of way of being that is at rest in itself, that is not existing in relationship to relationships."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "But to some degree it's also like, you know, rearranging the deck chairs in the Titanic."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "And there is the avenue by which some people relax the heart."}
{"prompt": "Impermanence", "completion": "So I talked about the pictures, the old woman, young woman, flipping and switching the perception, seeing both, and so you might try that this week."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "They had released a video in which their spokesperson was threatening to unleash waves of peace and harmony throughout the world."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So how does the onion know these things? It's kind of scary."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Because it's easy to see when someone else is trying to impose their ideas of justice on you."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "They overcome divisions in society."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "In fact, the only standards for fairness that he imposed were on the monastic sanghas."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So no matter how well you design a society, you would constantly be having to fight in order to maintain power."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "He also says in trying to maintain power, your views of what's true and what's false tend to get skewed."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Because if the king comes up with a bad policy, people are going to blame the monk."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "At the same time, he never used the principle of karma to justify the mistreatment of poor and otherwise disadvantaged people."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "The Buddha's compassion doesn't say you just leave people there."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "The primary example of this in the canon is a story of Anguli Mala."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And so he chases after the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Finally he realizes he's been defeated."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And so Anguli Mala learns some compassion."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So the basic principle here is that there are cases where justice is not done in line with the principle of karma."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Nobody would ever get there."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "What he does say is that karma does types of actions tend to give types of results."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "He says, your state of your mind is like a body of water."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Change your state of mind."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You think about the different kinds of justice we know about."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But there has to be a beginning point to the story."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "There's what's called restorative justice, which basically says, okay, wrong was done, let's try to bring things back to the condition prior to the wrong."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But he focused on looking back, and he realized that there is no conceivable beginning to the many, many lifetimes you've had."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Again, we'd never be satisfied with the justice that was given."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "But the happiness offered by nirvana is noble in that sense."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Nonetheless, as I said earlier, there's no beginning or ending to the stories that we can tell about who did what, to whom."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "The goal may or may not be attained."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "He would talk about the rewards of helping the disadvantaged, the rewards of being harmless to other people."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You have less need to fear your own death."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So if we were to think about trying to work for social change under the headings of Buddhism, we'd have to think, okay, we have to put aside the concept of justice and focus more on what the Buddha has to say about generosity, virtue, and the development of universal goodwill."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You can't use this sort of guilt to try to force people to say, you've got to help with our efforts."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You try to make them as attractive as possible."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "May you learn how to stop doing horrible things."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Good will is meant for everybody, people of all races, all backgrounds, all whatever dividing things that you see in the society."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "You don't have to use that story to justify virtue."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Now there was one drawback here."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "I won't go into what I know about it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Walked up and down the street looking for it."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And also, there is a concept of a just war, which is present in Hinduism."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And if you want to put an end to suffering, here are other ways you can do it if you want."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "He's always very careful not to impose things on people."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So as a follow-up to that, I was thinking about how often you translate the word, made thighs, goodwill."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "If you ask me, I agree with that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And that also probably comes from the theistic thing that, oh, our parents love us."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So love can actually be a force for divisiveness."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "It's just you say it would be good if this person could act on the causes for true happiness and understand those causes and be willing to do that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Jeff, there's a question behind you."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "What it means is, here's a situation that I can't really change unless I try to do things that are unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "It's sucking everything out of the rest of society into a very few hands."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "So you could help people see that they don't have to believe in karma entirely, but see that their actions will have an impact coming back to them and point out to them, okay, if you're short-sighted, you're going to be missing some long-term harm that you're doing to yourself."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "If you make your happiness dependent on receiving justice all the time, it's going to be very, very unstable."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "And people finally say, yeah, this is really unjust, and we should stop doing that."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "This takes goodwill in order for everybody to see, okay, this is not working."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "See, I mean, that's what I'm working on in my work, but what I don't understand is how, I don't see why if individuals are able to understand common humanity, why can't we create a system that would be able to be applied across? Okay, well then the question is, how would you define justice in that system? And you might start discovering that you have some disagreements about what counts as justice and what doesn't."}
{"prompt": "Wisdom Over Justice", "completion": "Okay, I guess we've run over time."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (1 of 5) Aggitation/Calm.", "completion": "There can be the first really palpable and impactful experience of calm that I experienced, at least in my spiritual life, especially before I was interested in spirituality, was when I was 18 and I went into a little Catholic chapel in France, and immediately this calm descended in the cool ancient chapel with stone walls."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Opening to how the body is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "How is the mind? Remembering how supportive it is to allow relaxation of body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Maybe the inside of the throat can relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "That is actually, it's already being known in a way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: What is True Right Now?", "completion": "Sometimes the mind will just relax around that and there can be a way that that lets you be with experience more fully."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And it's the story of a young person who decides to become free."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And after a while came across an old person who was struggling under the weight of bringing groceries home."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And so this young person picked up the groceries for the old person and carried them home to the person's home."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "But still didn't understand."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "That's where the weight is."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And unnecessarily, putting unnecessarily weight on the mind."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And those are the burdens we want to learn to put down."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "It's a nice description of enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So why are these burdens? The burden of pleasure and comfort is usually not a burden in and of itself, feeling pleasure and comfort."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "They probably buy new clothes a little bit more often than are needed than just to be a comfortable, content life."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So I don't know what you think of this analysis, but I hopefully points a little bit to the idea that a pleasure and comfort is a bigger part of people's lives and most people recognize."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So it was kind of like that."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And so they said to each other, you see, he's decided to go back."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "So that's all kind of a, it can be burden that people live under, a weight in the mind, the preoccupation and concern."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I don't know what is heavier, but maybe beliefs are heavier than comfort and pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I have to be a person who is successful in this particular way."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I just felt like it was up to me to make everyone happy."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "The weight, the belief that I need to hold on to my resentments forever."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Because through meditation, I learned a sense of well-being and stability here."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "When I discovered slowly that my track record for predicting the future was abysmal."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "A common scenario was that, I don't know how common it was."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Other people should treat me a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "One of the things that's interesting about meditation practice, if the meditation practice can get quiet enough, the mind can get quiet and still, we can see placed in the mind where there are no beliefs, in the sense that beliefs are not operating."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Meaning we tend to be able to respond to the world more creatively, more wiser if we're not carrying the burden of a lot of beliefs, which obscure what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "We can't do something else."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "As if they're required, or like that's how they're going to be a good person or something."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "There's all this kind of swirl of ideas around self that are a big weight."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And it was the first time I traveled in a non-Western country, if 19 isn't an adult, as an adult, but without my parents."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "But how to help people, how to walk through the world and be involved in things which maybe are physically heavy or take time and effort."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "Is there lightness in doing things which are unpleasant? But the joy is the light mind that does it, as opposed to that physically pleasant or unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "It doesn't carry a burden."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And my mind, when I finished, felt light and open."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I don't know if people like this story."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "I'd come out to the classroom, look outside."}
{"prompt": "Burdens of the Mind", "completion": "And if it's light in the mind, then it's also going to be pretty easy to put it down."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radiating Metta for All Beings", "completion": "Together with some of these categories, I'll mention them just playfully as we go through these directions."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radiating Metta for All Beings", "completion": "So just a note, that's really the best way."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Radiating Metta for All Beings", "completion": "After this essence of goodness, this essence of goodwill, trusting that it is here, trusting that it is here, it's shining, even if it may not be felt or too perceptible right now, it's okay, or it might be perceptible right now, trust, trust your goodness is shining, your goodwill is here."}

{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "He says this is an important part of being heedful, realizing that there are dangers in the future."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But he said that treasure is subject to fire, floods, kings, thieves, hateful heirs."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "One, it's conviction in the Buddha's awakening."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Some of them require restraint, some of them require putting a lot of extra effort into things that can be difficult."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But you can't buy freedom from remorse with any amount of money."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Because many times it's not when you're sitting around here listening to a Dharma talk that you're going to think of killing somebody."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "I think I may have mentioned this to this group a couple years back."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "You know, your judgment gets fuzzy."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And so it's best to say, no, alcohol at all."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And that sense that, okay, I don't care about the future, I just want to do what I do right now, that's really not very wise."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "The first one is learning."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "The Dharma is basically about actions."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "If you have questions about why we're doing this, the Buddha says, okay, go ahead and ask."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Your heart just gets smaller and smaller and smaller."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And this is where, after having established a good relationship to time, past and future, with the six other treasures then, and the seventh treasure, you really can focus specifically on what's arising and passing away in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But if you behave in such a way that you don't carry those regrets around, there are no sensitive sort of scarred areas in the mind that you can't touch."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "What the mind is holding onto is a particular type of activity."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And the goose followed him in."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "It had never been in enclosed space before."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "In the meantime, the goose freaking out head straight to the window, gets to the window, realizes it can't get out."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And you may have noticed that the goose is very much like the mind."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "What's the prudent way to live? A way that's looking at where you really are investing your energy."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Considering all of the current storms and hurricanes around which are swirling around us and the difficulty of practicing certain parts of what you were talking about, especially right speech, right livelihood, and considering the prominent people today who are indeed doing battle with each other, do you think that it is even possible for someone who really wishes to practice the Buddhist way and wishes to adhere to that kind of ethics, some of the things you were talking about today, can really engage in what we now know as our political arena without being absolutely contradicted by all the things that they would be forced to do and say."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And do you think that's really just totally impossible to materialize? I think we have to look in the long term because what's happened is that the level of discourse has gone down."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "I think over time it's important."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But I'm just curious your reflections on the reason in the tradition for this being the reason that's given for Sila."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "Now it sounds like, okay, you're not harming them because it's in your own self-interest."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "So it is a promise you make to yourself because you know this kind of behavior is always going to be unskillful."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "When you're really tempted to have a drink or you're really tempted to lie you don't do it."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "But there are a lot of areas that are not really covered by the precepts and it's the same with that bear awareness sign."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "So in those areas that are not covered by the precepts, you have to be able to read the situation to figure out what's appropriate."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "And the guy who asked the question got upset and left."}
{"prompt": "Wealth", "completion": "I mean, there were other people in the Buddha's time who taught there is no self, therefore eat, drink, and be married because, you know, there's no self to reap the rewards of your actions, you know, just do what you want to do in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I mean I'm sorry the Four the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Fourth Foundation of Mindful, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness in the Eightfold Path, Wise Mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so that's that's a foundation for mindfulness in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And actually I understand that modern-day neuroscience agrees with this."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And then we may begin to be able to touch into the feeling tone whether a bodily experience is pleasant unpleasant or neutral."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "In particular, the presence and absence of greed, aversion, and delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We can also understand these as these instructions, the first foundation of body, the second of feeling, the third of looking at these qualities in the mind as being exercises to direct the attention to."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We can just open, as I was describing in the guided meditation, just open to what's most obvious and be aware of it as an experience in the present moment, the body, a feeling, a mental experience."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because there are five lists in the fourth foundation, all Dharma lists that are an encouragement to look at our experience from the perspective of the hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, the seven factors of awakening, and the four noble truths."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "In the instructions, the encouragement is to notice the presence or absence of the hindrances."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So that's that's kind of the the way, a way let's say of understanding what this fourth foundation is, is to begin to understand experience through these Dharma perspectives."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "What is the truth of suffering? What is the truth of, so the Buddha explores these questions in that."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We do need to understand the concepts that the Buddha taught, what he meant by suffering even, what he meant by the arising of suffering and the ending of suffering, and what he meant by the path leading to the ending of suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "This is an encouragement to recognize in present moment experience, the experience of dukkha, the experience of the arising of dukkha, the experience of the ending of dukkha, and the experience of the path leading to the ending of dukkha."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So what does that mean? So the language is encouraging us to know in the present moment, it's not just understand it as the concept, the language is definitely this, understands as it actually is, yattabhuta is the word for as it actually is, as it has come to be, and this is this is connected with the understanding in the present moment, the arising of experience in the present moment, that word is really pointing to the momentary experience of the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So understanding in the present moment these four aspects, and again as with the other frameworks in the Fourth Foundation, any moment of experience, one of these four will be arising or will be present."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So this kind of seeing them in the moment understanding of this perspective, this is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha, this is the ending of dukkha, this way of seeing over and over again in the suthas, this way of seeing as pointed to as being freedom, as being the ending of suffering, and I think in a way this may be why it's the last list in our Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It also includes in there just the simple kind of experience of a sight, a sound, like this is the arising of a sense experience."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So this kind of seeing, with any experience, this kind of seeing will free the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so I want to talk about two in particular."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Or to see or understand, this is how that aversion arises."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I'm trying to decide which thread to pick up on."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Because it is impermanent, there's nothing in our experience that lasts, actually nothing that lasts for more than a split second."}
{"prompt": "The Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths", "completion": "All experience is unreliable."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And of course, we all know that type right when the mind just takes off and we're wallowing in it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Of course, we're impacted because our heart opens up to compassion when there is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Okay, that was a longer dharma than I intended to give, but that's the framing for tonight, dear friends."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And I was, I just felt that like she's just like so rooted in, you know, the present moment of, you know, just the wholeness of everything or, you know, the non, what do you call it, the emptiness side of things."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "So, so as we come into groups, small groups, I invite you to speak only from your own experience, not comment on somebody else's experience, not ask them question, and not serve as a facilitator."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "Only speak from your own experience for your own benefit."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Our Inner Quan-Yin and the Cries of the World", "completion": "And so it goes around and around, and staying close to the integrity of your own experience, speaking for your own benefit, not educating or impressing anyone, just a sacred space, and entering the space with love, with care for yourself and others, as if three Kwanians are showing up, listening to each other, holding each other with care, with love."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "You know, those of you out there should learn where the which is."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And generally I think that if we're having difficulty with our meditation, it's probably not so much, probably the main issue is our attitude."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And it might be useful if we feel like we're meditation is not going well, we're having difficulty with it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "So for example, someone could sit and meditate and have certain thoughts, and maybe there are thoughts about wanting something, maybe wanting ice cream."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And maybe our minds are works of art, or they can be works of art."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "So there are certainly debilitating attitudes a person can have, that if they're chronic, can build up stress, tension, kind of undermine ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And it's very easy not to notice the general mood or the attitude that's there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And so there's kind of a very quick feedback there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And so, but if you take that as, you know, it's not really, meditation is not really working there because you're not staying present and you consider what's the attitude behind those thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And then I would like to ask you, after I've listed these five, if you can identify some common commonalities in these five, common denominators, things that they all have in common."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Being aware of things that allow."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "We're kind of doing something, right? But almost doing nothing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Everything you need is already here."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "I chose those three in purpose because those three, kindness, compassion and letting go, are the ways of talking about what the Buddha called right attitude."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "However, I think there is something very profound about the fact that it is worded in the negative because there is something spectacularly beautiful that happens to the mind when it releases itself from its attitudes."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "We go into a new environment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "Most minds are always preoccupied with something."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "So your mind can be a work of art."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "It's not trying to do anything."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "It's not meant to see the true physical nature of things."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Attitude", "completion": "And it's doing so, supports you as you go through your life."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Maybe I shouldn't say I'm always smiling."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "I don't know if that's true, but I'm happy to be sharing the Dharma in this way and to be meditating together and to see your chats, even though I'm here in the room alone, to recognize that we're practicing together."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about contentment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Doesn't mean they match our preferences exactly."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "It's associated with being settled without the agitation of leaning forward, always wanting more, I want more, I want more."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And usually when we have those types of agitated feelings, it's not when we have access to our greatest wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So as I was saying, not so much that we have exactly what we want, but our being okay with what's there, with what we are already experiencing."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Freedom from illness is the foremost good fortune."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Nibbana, that is freedom awakening."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "The thing is truly lacking at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "I just need this thing or experience or whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And I'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And see if we can dial it down, dial it back, this feeling that things are lacking and I need to have more."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And you wouldn't have a feeling of wanting to get intoxicated."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "But a sense of contentment is more about bringing the attention back here to the present moment and to see what's truly lacking in this moment, in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "And instead it can be a little bit more collected, and a sense of wholeness and steadiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "Like, where is it okay? Maybe we first see where it's not okay."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "This discontentment is dukkha, dissatisfaction, stress, not feeling like things are quite right, like things need to be different somehow."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "But also just recognizing that often we feel better, I'll use this generic language better when things are simpler, that often more, more, more doesn't lead to greater, greater, greater happiness."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Contentment", "completion": "So is there a way in which we can remind ourselves of that lesson and help support a sense of contentment, recognizing that getting more doesn't necessarily mean we're going to be happier."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Buddhism Part 1: The Story of the Buddha", "completion": "I'm not exactly at the beginning of its time in the United States but there was a time it wasn't even here, right? And now the secular mindfulness is just in the schools and believe it or not, my son in college, he's in a fraternity which is odd enough for me, my background, that that's the case."}

{"prompt": "Introduction to Buddhism Part 1: The Story of the Buddha", "completion": "It's the experience of well-being that's free, from preoccupy, free of being caught up in sensual desire and hatred and fear and all the kind of things that people get caught up in."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Strong Back, Soft Front", "completion": "It's hard to open without that support."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And I first want to say as an introduction to what I'm going to say, prelude to what I'm going to say, that in my understanding of Buddhist teachings, Buddhist practice, in my understanding of what's important in this world, that each of you is important, that each of you is valuable, each of you is precious and lovable, each of you is important."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "So we are so important that we don't want to be limited by ourselves, but learn to trust something that's greater than ourselves or something which is not in the whole self-system."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "All these kind of ways in which we have the self, we want to assert the self in the situation in life."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "The third aspect of practice is using our attention to be in the present moment in some higher quality way than usual, to be in the present moment so we're not caught up in our thoughts, or caught up in self preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "Now in certain situations like in meditation or certain activities where we can give ourselves fully, mindfully over to the activity, there can be a delightful sense of forgetting the self."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "You know, recently I had surgery for my eye, and I had to remember to do these eye drops multiple times through the day."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "But to have learned what it is to forget the self, and to learn to track ourselves and be mindful of it all, we can start noticing a difference between just putting the eye drops in, caring for ourselves that way, versus needing to be the very best medicine eye dropper person in the world, most skilled and wanting all our friends to recognize how great we are in putting the drops in our eyes, and make sure we place ourselves someplace in the public view so everyone can see how good I am at putting the drops in my eyes."}
{"prompt": "What is Important", "completion": "And also how that strong self creates the barriers that happen when we create the other as the other."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And if you haven't done it before, then I don't think it's going to hurt to come for the series here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And now there are scholars who are beginning to do research about how different countries locked on to the swine flu virus and how to handle it in different ways, media locked on in different things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So the unwatched mind has these dangers to it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Some people feel like they're coming home when they come and do mindfulness practice, because in this fielding that at home you can pick your nose, right? At least when you're alone."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "In order to support that watching, we're also trying to cultivate calm, develop the ability to be calm."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "The mindfulness is not a vague kind of presence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "There's a deliberate quality to mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So for this, take a posture, a chair on the floor, that's a little bit more alert than you would normally sit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "As you take a deeper breath in, perhaps you can feel like you're massaging yourself from the inside, stretching, expanding the torso, the rib cage."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Letting your stomach hang forward a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And if your mind, your attention is pulled away from the breath by anything at all, when you notice that, in a simple and clear way, acknowledge what the mind is now involved in."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Whatever occurs, whatever arises, whether it's the breathing or sound or whatever, stay with the noticing, stay with acknowledgement instead of slipping in to involvement with thoughts or involvement with feelings."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Okay, so what were you caught up in? You caught up in the expectation or desire for something more interesting in the breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "That's what you wanted? Yes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "You're supposed to acknowledge what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "There's plenty of people who do mindfulness practice, who do a kind of mindfulness practice where they might be the checklist approach to mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Because towards the end, I started to kind of see myself standing apart from those three things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "The freedom is found more there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "But we don't want to be aloof or held apart from experience either."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "We also want to feel it and sense it fully."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "It's not the practice itself."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And as soon as your hand goes in your hand, their hand goes limp as they go off to look at someone else."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "This is a listening to a sound."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "But you can't because of these thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "If you get really tired and sleepiness makes it really hard to be mindful, then at some point return and let the sleepiness become the subject of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So rather than fighting a preoccupation or trying to fight against it, we can turn towards it, recognize that it's there and then practice clearly acknowledging feeling being present and experimenting with mindfulness, experimenting with acknowledgement where can you see it and recognizing it without being caught by it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I mean, the poor kid was suffering."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "But I kind of stayed my ground and balanced, and he could flail away and do what he needed to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "We acknowledge it, and as we acknowledge it, then offer it whatever presence that is useful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And different people at different times or different reasons have different predispositions to certain patterns of preoccupation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And you'll get these, and I have a handout, you'll see these five on it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I think when I sit down now, I'm going to have to be a little bit more alert to notice how that works."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I start thinking about that vacation in San Diego that I can do on the beach."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So as we see the patterns and get to know them more and more, we can start bringing a greater kind of investigation or understanding to what is actually going on, what are the details, what are the dynamics going on as we meditate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "No one seems to complain about it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "I would say that riding a bicycle requires a lot of monitoring."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "But once you learn, it becomes easier and easier."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So for example, was there any calmness during that sitting? And in a scale of one to ten, how calm were you? One being, you know, I don't think so."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "So maybe you put it a four, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "What was your, how strong was your ability to let go? So a thought arises, could you let go of it and come back? Just kind of, you know, how strong was your mindfulness? How strong was your motivation in the practice? How strong, how in touch were with your body? What degree of concentration did you have? What was the quality of your effort? Was there a good effort? Was there a lot of effort? Was there hardly any effort at all? How quiet did the thinking mind become? How did you enjoy it, the meditation? Was there enjoyment? Now, all these things are not meant to be a grade."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "It's not meant like to judge you this good, bad meditation or bad meditation, but it's to help sensitize you to the kinds of things you might notice as you meditate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "Not more busy, but more peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "And so there's a trial and error approach to finding just the right balance."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation 2 Week 1", "completion": "This seems to feel like too much, and then we come back to balance for a while, and maybe it's too little, and then, oh, that's too complacent."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "There was no natural line that was like a river or mountain ridge marking the difference."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "And so their attention is mostly going to themselves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "There's no point to that unless you're using that, oh, look at that, I'm the kind of person who keeps being self-critical."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Any opportunity I have, I'm back criticizing myself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "So the point I'm trying to say here is that we try to do something with meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "You've done enough of that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Sometimes I'll choose something else to think about."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "I'm getting in my cars now 10 years old."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Or maybe I'll simply pay attention by driving, since I am driving."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "So now you focus on the meditation cushion shelves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Choices and Be Aware", "completion": "Now you're choosing to focus on that."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "And these researchers formulated what they call the push-pull model of moralization."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Being hurt, we withdraw into ourselves, build a wall around ourselves, become hard, cruel."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Whether hedonism or rationalization, Ajahn Sajitta said, all dhammas converge on feeling."}
{"prompt": "Taking the Backwards Ethical Step", "completion": "Yeah? I don't want to be a bad person."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "The texts that present him as being a little bit self-indulgent, especially with food and things."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "He asked the queen, who do you consider most dear? Now, perhaps, I kind of interpreted a little bit that a self-indulgent king is kind of expecting the queen to say, well, you dear, and she says, but what her answer is, I hold myself most dear."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "So that's OK, right? So we're similar to everyone."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And Buddha gets the conclusion that if you love yourself, you shouldn't harm anybody else."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Even if people didn't do a lot of benefit for each other, they just stopped harming each other."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "It starts off being explicitly about if a person wants to reach a state of peace, a profound state of personal peace, to realize that for oneself, to attain that."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And he goes on and says more about how to do this in very kind of dramatic terms."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "So to be interested in creating good conditions for them."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "So when loving kindness is strong, the way you know it, apparently, the way it's demonstrated is no malice, no hate."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "That doesn't work so well."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And the story goes that the Buddha was in town, in one of his places where he lived with his monastics, and it was time for them to go off for the three-month rain retreat."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "The monastics spent a night here, and in the morning found a town not far away where they could go for alms."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "The next day the monks re-entered the grove and wholeheartedly began their retreat."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "Those townspeople stand in a distance asking themselves, when are they going away? In the same way, those devas wondered, when are those monks going away? The devas realized that the monks were going to stay put for the entire three-month period of the reign's retreat."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And I think not a few of the people here in the West, maybe myself included, have gone like we went to Burma to practice many of us."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "One of the ways I saw it, I first started practicing Buddhism when I was in my early 20s."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "And then the government goes and saves them."}
{"prompt": "Caring for Yourself and Caring for Others", "completion": "But really being encompassing it all as part of our own welfare, I think it's more necessary now in this world than ever before."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So to me, there's a kind of purity in that."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "This is exciting and say yes to actually this is pretty boring."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "This is, I feel like this poem is a comment on our practice as a whole, but also maybe we could say a comment on First Day of Retreat practice."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Praise the mist, the warrior name, the earth eclipse, the fired leap."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Praise the path on which we're led."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "We have this practice over and over."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And so I think that so maybe we could say that the most basic conflict when we meditate is our bodies here and our mind is somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "But here with this request to stay here, to not to move and this request, this request to say yes, we get to experience what's there in a different way."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "I don't want to stay here for this."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "We want, I mean, we wouldn't be here."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "We wouldn't be on a retreat if we didn't somewhere in our being deeply want to wake up, deeply want to practice and deeply know that there's something, there's a treasure in this moment that's waiting for us."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So you're really close and you kind of, and I just have this very vivid memory of Mel, my Zen teacher."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So I'd always go make a cup of coffee for him."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And we, we have, we have our, we have our, our own characteristic ways of avoiding this moment and avoiding practice."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "In, in the, in the classical early Buddhist teachings, those characteristic patterns of avoidance are called the hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "You know, that's studying all the ways we say no."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And, you know, when you go to a new city or something, it's always interesting free markets with tech antiques and all kinds of, you know, and I just, I just this awakening of desire."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So I'm kind of holding the cash in my, in my pocket and walking around and looking and see what's good, what's what do I want? You know."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "No, you know, we look around and we see what's wrong."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And then we opened it, and it was like, full of dirt and kind of looked used."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "It activated the sense of self and the sense of, you know, who'd been wronged."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So, you know, restlessness can take many forms, but it's, I think we can all relate to the feeling of being anxious about something and being restless and how hard it is to actually sit with that."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "What do you think you're doing? I remember I was on a long retreat and getting into a little bit of new territory for me in the meditation, getting pretty quiet, pretty concentrated."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And I remember having this heart to heart with one of my teachers."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And I said, Carol, I just, I don't think this is the right practice for me."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And I kind of opened my eyes and I looked at her and I said, what? And she just pointed at me and she said, doubt, that's doubt."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "It didn't mean that there wasn't fear."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "But from the Dharma perspective, you know, joy is empty and fear is empty."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "You know, which Yogi is going to learn more? Who's going to grow more in insight and compassion? So I think to be grateful for our difficulties, to be grateful for the places we get stuck and to study that."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "There was something that was calling me of that."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "Not exactly, sometimes it was monastic, but to really go on this journey, this contemplative journey."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And there's different ways of kind of working it in one way and another."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "It's not like something needs to change, and then it's perfect."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "So how do we hold our own inherent wholeness, or that we're not broken, we don't need fixing."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And it's funny to me to have that mentality, and to have come across this practice, which is, you know, one aspect of this practice is certainly retreat practice, right? We do the same thing every day."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And I remember meeting Mel, and I thought that this is a Purse so every morning for the last 55 years, Mel has sat meditation at 5."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "40 in the morning, and he bicycle, he doesn't bicycle anymore."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And then, you know, in Zen they have the way they bow and they do this and that, and it's the same exact thing."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "But you have this like, it's like you're kind of like the elephant walking boom, boom, boom."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "If we can infuse all of that with our love, our care, then that's Dharma, you know."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And, and so I think about my friend and how he has lived over these last months."}
{"prompt": "Saying Yes to Life", "completion": "And so that's it for our life to be our refuge."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relying on This Abandon That", "completion": "It's okay to notice that pleasantness."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relying on This Abandon That", "completion": "We can abandon habits of mind associated with unwholesome intention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relying on This Abandon That", "completion": "To abandon even the pleasantness of relaxation, for instance."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relying on This Abandon That", "completion": "And as the body and mind do relax, perhaps some measure of relaxation, we can let go of that orientation and just explore being with whatever is arising."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "But you know give me an example."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "Anyway, it's still something that one should one has to train oneself to see it as suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "So perception would it be right to say that perception is the one thing that can help that is that is required correct perception or skillful perception is the one that required for comprehension."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "Okay but other kinds of pains and other kinds of fabrications are there which are probably also falling under the first noble truth but I don't know if we can actually deal with them in that same way."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Question and Answer", "completion": "You were the one who came in."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "Because I wrote those words and I don't know who you were talking about, but I know it wasn't me."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And insight into the emptiness of self, we could say, is the radical extrapolation of that, taking that to its end, perhaps, of deeply affirming the self."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And that kind of disliked self and all the consolation of thoughts and feelings about that is very, very kind of sticky."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And then Vachigota is kind of just waiting there and eventually gets up and goes and leaves."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And anytime we get majorly sidetracked, we can just gently return the attention to that key distinction."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "As a psychologist, part of my effort is to help people develop capacities that may have been underdeveloped or may have been derailed earlier in development or may have been compromised by trauma."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "Healing the self is important."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "That there's a kind of logic of the unfolding of the Dharma that we close our eyes and what comes up and what seems just like some bizarre intrusion and some pain and some annoyance and memories and anxieties."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And all of these things that feel like intrusions in our practice, from this perspective, they are our path."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "That all the things from our past and our place within our family, childhood, all of this arises at some point if we sit enough."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And some sense of sweetness for ourself really feels so natural."}

{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "We learn to notice this place of ground, the sense of the home base of me."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "We start to bring that very sense of self and home base into awareness, to know it as not our home."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "It's like the front edge of our perspective, the sense of self here, world there, the sense that there's somehow some kind of film or something separating us from life."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "And that's its expression in the world, is love, love for the self, love for the world."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "It's wonderful to disappear into your practice."}
{"prompt": "The Non-paradox of Self and Not Self", "completion": "Let's just sit for a moment together, please."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "Maybe some of the people who came to the day long came this morning to try to participate."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "And hopefully it's a wonderful way of infusing your daily life, your home life even, with Adharma and with practice."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "It makes sense food and other things perhaps, but there's certainly a lot of fear and it's being expressed in many different ways."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "I recently was told of a chaplain who does in the field chaplaincy for first responders, to firefighters, to police officers and people who go to situations that are often quite tragic and where people are often dealing with the tragedy of death and natural disasters and fires and things that come out of the blue for many people and are shocking and upsetting."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "And here in California now, it looks like we're going to have another drought."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "Maybe some of these will be close to where we live and affect us directly."}

{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "I know some tech people now are working from home, and so they don't have the daily contact in person contact with colleagues."}
{"prompt": "Non-anxious Presence", "completion": "We'll keep things updated there the best we can about how we're going to develop this means of online programs and teachings and look forward to having more contact and as we develop this way and as we develop this online offering, we'll figure out some way so that it can be mutual and reciprocal so we can take questions or maybe there's ways of having discussion groups, maybe over Zoom or something so there can be some feeling of actively engaging this process as well, not just simply listening and watching."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Meditation for some people is a strategy in order to deal with death."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And for them meditation is not about the big questions of life but have to do with the simplicity of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And the value of really spending time with that and looking at it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Maybe there's better things to do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And I might ask, what's the emotion that is fueling that question? And some people will say, it's fear, fear of missing out, fear of not doing it right, fear of failing this life, or fear of not really understanding what's the purpose of my life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Concerns with death might have to do with fear and to look at the fear deeply."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Sometimes what fuels these things is conceit."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "And so we investigate that, we bring our attention to that."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "Mindfulness meditation involves looking deeper and deeper."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "So what is your relationship to the big questions of life, to questions of meaning, questions about life and death and what is it, questions of what's most ultimate, questions of God and heaven and rebirth and purpose and do you have something that you believe is ultimate? Or are you searching for that? And to respect that you, whatever it is you're doing like this, respect it deeply but then turn the attention around and look more deeply at what's underneath that, what's fueling it, what's animating those beliefs, so that involvement and see what you see there and find and see if that might help you to become quieter, stiller, more at ease, more centered here and now in that place where there can be no attachments."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Meaning (3 of 5) The Big Questions", "completion": "So thank you very much and continue this idea of meaning tomorrow."}

{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "If you need to move, if you need to move to become more comfortable, if you need to lie down, if that's what your body needs from you right now."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Inviting yourself to open up, to land, to arrive in the body as a refuge."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So that any charge can move down and be discharged."}

{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Definitely, I felt the lower body thinking, really good thinking, generous and creative."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So the invitation is to stay with the body, especially with the lower part of the body."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And now this perception, there's a sense of, ah, not tightness, not clenching, it's fist, the sense of benevolence and kindness offering safety."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So, the offer is, I discovered a smile of sadness and care."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Ah, that offers more spaciousness, like, oh, yes, trust."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "I can be more present with challenges."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So in memory of the past, actually, in the third part, in the next part, we'll do recollection practices."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So my invitation now for this next period of walking and movement is to continue to feel embodied in your body and also bring this sense of an inner smile, this openness, this greeting, experience, friendliness, the same way that again, you would just smile perhaps, walking, smiling at someone."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Let me make sure that we have time."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "I want to acknowledge a few more reflections that came towards the end of that last session, beginning of this one."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "In fact, we're going to make that building up into the next session, which now we're going to turn our minds into appreciation and joy, and goodness, recollection practices of inner goodness, of our goodness, goodness inside goodness outside."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And the Buddha is looking out of your eyes with a sense of appreciation, the sense of meta, onto whatever you're looking at."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And if you need to get up and move or turn your head to see more things you're welcome to, just take your time."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Letting your heart feel full."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Invite your mind to turn to, to actively turn to what is here, not what is missing."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Be lifted up by the beauty of this aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And to be of service to others."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "All that's arising, challenges included in this time."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Breathing, breathing, feeling embodied."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And after that we'll come into the big group and do the sharing, either in chat or you can unmute yourself."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So there is so much rich wisdom in this community."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And we'll be in groups of four or five and we'll do the format that's called the spiral."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "They've learned today something to offer."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "It's a spiral, so each person will offer one idea, one thought, one thing that has come up for them today."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "The alphabetical order might be the easiest way to do that, or you can choose a reverse alphabetical order, whatever you want, but just something that's easy."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "I think it'll go so quickly, you'll be amazed."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And let's have our, raise our blue hands and the way to do that."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "If somebody would like to get us started with your reflections with what's come up today, what have you realized? Or what happened in the group? You can also give a report from a group sharing."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So it's kind of reptitious for them."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And it was quite beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And if you, if you raise your hand, I'll probably see you also."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And a couple days I felt like I was losing it, losing it entirely."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Questions, comments, anything."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Okay, this is the time to go sit."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "And there is a beauty and grace in doing that, in seeing the interconnection as we feed ourselves every day."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "Anyway, Buddhism using soul is kind of funky, but I'm using it as a soulful, as a soulful way of relating to life, relating to others with beauty, with grace, with love."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So challenges and in psychology, there's idea of post-traumatic growth that we wouldn't grow unless we had these challenges in our lives and we found ways to actually be with them with more resilience."}
{"prompt": "Resilience and Gladdening Our Mind in Challenging Times", "completion": "So the smiling practice is one way into the temple that I came up with today with the session."}

{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And it was enough that it would happen, like I could stand in the same spot and sometimes I would watch the mist kind of float through and see if the rainbow was appearing here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It was appearing in exactly the same place as long as I was standing in the same place."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And often I think sometimes we have various patterns or habits that result in familiar contractions, familiar senses of experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "Not that it's being created in the moment, like the rainbow is being created in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "But they're mostly, they're not directly aimed."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "That's a key, a key teaching he gave to his own son."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "Studying what feels like is I me mine."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It's a description of often what we get to look at when we turn our attention to our experience and so instead of you know when we think of oh this is me you know start to look at it when we have a strong sense of I or me when we start to look at that what we might begin to see is this process of dependent origination unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "And it's not something we can look for almost by its definition."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Not-self as Insight", "completion": "It's notice that things are impermanent with knowing that things are impermanent."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "A gentle connection with the breath or sound or the body."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "If one speaks or acts with an impure or unwholesome mind, suffering follows one."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So it's really important to investigate a little bit further, even if the immediate response is like, you know, pure mind, evil mind, but just to look a little bit closer, because it's actually pointing us to the way that we create suffering in our own lives, and in the world around us, and in the way that we can live free from that."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So, you know, I think for many people before we start to practice, this perception is that the problems in our life are caused by something external."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So, you know, these are the things we do, rather than being fully with this as it is in our life right now, in this moment, we're looking for something else, we're trying to push it away, make it different, or only have that nice bit, only have that lovely bit."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "But it's an urge within us that we all have."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "We can let it be there, let it change."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "The room noticeably got warmer when we all sat down in here."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So it's really important to notice this."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Then there's our work where we've been able to make the money to go and buy the food."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So that's connected with other people."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Using our thought or reflection to just recognize, not to make half or believe or anything, but to recognize our interconnection into being."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "When we're feeling anger and we're staying with the feeling of anger, it's really painful."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And I feel it's a very good thing if anyone's motivated to get involved in, whether it's helping to feed people who are hungry or helping to develop energy systems that are not exploiting the earth, or I noticed that recently when I went out on a book about a demonstration against fracking, which is a terribly destructive process for taking out a small amount of oil out of the earth, terribly destructive."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So people are starting to think it's a good thing to stand up and to actively do good and to prevent harm in the world."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "This is caused by something."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "So anyway, not that she would say don't do that."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "I'm not just bringing that up, but if you can, you know, if you want to say anything concerning that."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "And then you can say, may you be well."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "But I mean, what immediately comes to my mind is get a collective, get people together to try to stand up against this force."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "You don't experience? As you said, it sounds very abstract to you, because the experience in Western culture is very different."}
{"prompt": "Mind is the Forerunner of All Things", "completion": "Really deeply knowing that this is not separate from us."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "That's why I like to say in the guided meditation, just experience one breath."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And we're actually not with, we're never with every breath for 30 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "Every breath is just this breath."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And we might notice that over time, with just a little bit of consistency, it's like sort of creating these grooves in the mind or grooves in the heart."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "And Dogen has, I think it's like 93 teaching essays."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "This is, maybe we could say this is the heart of practice."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "There is no Buddhism outside of ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "So one of the ways that I understand this for myself in my practice is like, the way to big mind is through small mind."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "So we get to know, we study ourselves, we study, we get to see where do I cling, where do I resist, where do I overreact."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "It's all us, it's all inside us, it's all included."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "One of the, when I was doing a lot of Zen practice, one of my favorite parts of, so at the Berkeley Zen Center, there was a morning sitting, so it was at 5."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "Because Mao, the teacher, you know, he wasn't just kind of going through the moments and, okay, okay, bow and bow and bow."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "But it was worth getting up at 5 in the morning, getting in the car, driving over the bridge, you know."}
{"prompt": "Practicing Intimately", "completion": "Something is expressed in that, you know, we're not doing it."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And some of the language is it's natural that one follows the other."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And that double meaning comes into play when we look at what the meanings are for right view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And for today, I'll mention this conventional right view that's more like a belief."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "We do have this perspective, this point of view."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "They can move towards greater suffering or greater freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "Some are skillful or unskillful, depending how the word kusala is translated, K-U-S-U-L-A."}
{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And kusala can be translated as skillful or wholesome."}

{"prompt": "Eightfold Path: Right View (1 of 3)", "completion": "And you might see over the next 24 hours, before we come back tomorrow, and I teach about the liberating right view, you might kind of tune into your choices in what you say and what you do."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And from the beginning exploring this possibility of having an attitude of allowing, receiving, allowing your experience to be as it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And if there can be that sense of allowing, just that recognition, oh, this is how it is."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And we know that allowing a relaxation of body and mind can support this capacity to be present for what's here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness is a Natural Capacity", "completion": "And so dropping it in, maybe again, may the body relax and being available to see how the body responds to that."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "Maybe that's not fair, but I think in probably less so actually here at IMC, in a lot of places where I practice, you know, progress is largely equated with the deepening, the deepening, meaning that the Dharma penetrates more deeply, the mind settles in more deeply to the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "But then there's also this breath."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And so in some ways, I think of it as a kind of moral imperative to know ourselves, to allow the Dharma to seep into different corners of our life, because it's that process that actually makes us safer and safer for others."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "This is just as a practitioner or a person, you know, how safe are we for others? And what's the process by which we become really safe? Now there's a sense that perhaps at some point we can stop this process of letting the Dharma kind of stop, we could say, stop looking for places for the Dharma to soak into."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "That may be totally appropriate."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "This is, I'm quoting him a lot lately, this is Sam Harris again."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "At times it seems that the more we try to hide something, the more likely we are to reveal that very thing."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "So one of the kind of enduring rumbling anxieties of life is that we could be found out, you know? There's a sense of like we could be found out."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "If there were no aversive response to deviating from Silla, that would be a kind of destructive force in the world."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We wouldn't know mother exactly as mother in the same way, we wouldn't know all of these relationships in the same way."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "Like this not letting delusion kind of rain and obscure anything, feeling the discomfort actually of being a little out of step with what we want."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "See, we have these mind moments of really intense intention."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And this is like we can look to see, like how did something in our life become secret? How did that actually happen? And what were the kind of emotional flavors involved in that? And a lot of time it does come back to something that we are convicting ourselves of something we had no control over or something that we just didn't understand at the time."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "It emerges usually with a real other or imagined other."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And when a community can be really open to what it's like and share openly about that, we can start to sense just how much we share with other people."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And so through the practice, it's like we start to drain some of the emotional, affective charge from these areas of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We grow into the condition of being vulnerable as human beings."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We open to that and how we relate to that vulnerability is important."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And in those moments when secrets became secrets, we were really out of touch with that innocence."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "So we start to provide some of that sense of safety to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "So the Dharma spreads, you know, it flows out into the corners."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "Sure, the idea of being authentic."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "We've talked about impermanence and I think not self to me is that concept and how it relates to what we're talking about with this introspection because I think that to be authentic you have to, I've had to take the time to really truly understand what am I feeling, what am I thinking, what is at the core of it."}
{"prompt": "Secrets, Shame and Transparency", "completion": "And it is, and practice is, sounds very rich."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "And understanding the extent to which we do fabricate our experience makes us sense that if you know how we can do it in a more skillful way."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "One path was the path of forcing the mind into stillness."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "That includes ultimately abandoning even the path of concentration and the discernment that you developed."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "As for abandoning, that relates to the duty with the second noble truth, which is craving, you have to let it go."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "We're going to be taking pretty deeply into our experience here, because everything that we experience in the senses is fabricated."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "First, let's talk about the five aggregates, the five aggregates are form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications itself, and then consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "We cling to them, and because we cling to these things, the word for clinging, upadana also means that we take sustenance so that we feed on these things."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "That's the Buddha's analysis for suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "As the Buddha said, you see a form, there's going to be a feeling that arises from the form, and you have a perception about the form, you identify it with the perception, and then you elaborate it with thought constructs, which kind of fabrications, and then you're conscious of all these processes."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Who we are is made out of different aggregates, or a sense of who we are, that's an important distinction."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "The Buddha never defines what you actually are, he says if you define what you are you limit yourself, but the way we go through life we tend to define ourselves around the aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "For instance, we may decide that we are an infinite state of consciousness, and all the other aggregates that we identify exist within that infinite state of consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "These are the two main roles for the aggregates in the First Noble Truth, just in sensory experience in general, deals with the five aggregates, and in our raw material in which we construct our sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "As I said, these are related to clinging, and the word for clinging is related to feeding."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "That's our first primary perception, edible or not edible."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "You probably know the story."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "This is going to be important as we go through the day, and when we talk about fabrication, you have to see, one, the fact of fabrication, the extent to which you are putting your experience together, and then two, the relative value."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "We'll come back to these two steps as we discuss more advanced stages of insight in this afternoon."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Now the list of these three comes in the context of dependent chorizing."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "Sometimes you hear people saying, well, I'm told to get into John, I have to do direct the thought and evaluation, so what is direct thought and what is evaluation? And I keep telling people, these are things you're already doing."}
{"prompt": "Fabrication (sankhara) - Part 1: Lecture", "completion": "And see that these two are fabrications, ultimately you can let go."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "It's very common to have fear or anxiety apprehension be the drive for thinking, especially if thinking has a lot to do with planning."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "Just like we would bring quiet, attentive mindfulness to breathing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "And it's not about breathing exactly, but it's about being present for it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "So being present for thinking, but maybe without participating in the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "Sometimes it sort of has to do with how people are emotionally based and some people are more somatically based."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "But it can be so repetitive over and over and over again."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "It's the messenger, and we stay with the messenger and we don't read the message."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "So the underlying mood can affect the kind of thoughts we have and motivations we have."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "If we've done it for so long that this is normal."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "I've had the pleasure of talking with some of you about that and we'll have a little bit of time for questions."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "But it would be far more accurate to say the Four Ennobling Truths rather than the Four Noble Truths, Ennobling, that the very insight practice involved is Ennobling."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "So with ambiguity, if there's no basis for understanding how to make a decision, how to come to peace with something, that there's so much lack of clarity as to what is the basis for a decision."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "This needs to be addressed."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "And it was an exploration of how we can have clinging and have all sorts of secondary issues come up around something fortunate that occurs with us."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "And it is a book that basically takes us through the chaos of our emotions that come from the truth of the First Noble Truth and the truth of the Second Noble Truth, that these two together, that there is external chaos, and we would call that the First Noble Truth, the truth of dukkha, in our daily lives, that all of these external circumstances happen to us, everything from having a difficult person at work, to having struggles at work, to having struggles in our personal life, to having health issues, to having our country do something that makes us uncomfortable or ashamed or distressed, to having troubles with our friends or within our community, or the various kinds of health issues that we can have, all of these external sources of chaos that come about due to conditions."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "And when we've got a lot of emotional chaos, not so much clarity, not so much clarity."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "And then the third kind of tanha that's described in the Second Noble Truth, this not wanting to be in the dentist's chair at this moment, not wanting to be dealing with this cancer, or our concern about our teenager, I was just working with someone yesterday about that, and so not wanting to be a mom having to deal with this problem with their son at this particular time."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "It's not an inductive, deductive kind of, oh, it's because of this and this and this, or so forth."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "This is what I should do about my elderly parent."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "That's what I attempted to do with emotional chaos, the clarity, and what I've now been teaching people around the country for some period of time."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "I actually started teaching this way before I wrote the book to see what worked and didn't work."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "So for most of you, I know you've got a lot of experience that are here just to quickly remind you."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "Not better than, worse than, or even the same as."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "This is knowing the moment in the moment."}

{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "We're like this puppet dancing, puppet dancing."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "I don't want to live without proportion, like some kind of infection from the past."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "We all have a committee inside us, right? You've recognized that by now."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "So my anger, my uncertainty is the same as your anger, and your uncertainty, and your anger, and your uncertainty, is a phenomena of the mind, and these strong emotions, these strong emotions, when there is a lack of mindfulness and a lack of intention in relation to them, they lead to suffering."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "No, the exact experience that we have, ouch, ouch, right now, ouch, free of a lot of theory behind it in terms of this immediate application of it."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "And that's the first step of choice is, oh, look at this, look at this, look at this."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "In the fourth Noble Truth, the Buddha gives us a path for ending suffering, for ending dukkha."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "So is there anyone in this room who doesn't have a number of situations where you have an understanding as to what you should do or shouldn't do, and yet you don't do it in terms of your health relating to your difficult sibling, your relationship, we all have wise understanding that doesn't show up."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "Unwholesome goals, we've all chosen those and we know how that turns out."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "But even with wholesome goals, if we're not skillful moment to moment, we can end up causing a lot of suffering for ourselves and others."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "If you live a life that's mindful and has developed intention in it, you then, through your patience and persistence, these armies of patience and persistence, if you develop those, you become a person that is formidable."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Emotional Chaos", "completion": "But in my experience, for each of us, there's yet more opportunity if we have this clarity as to what our aspiration is, this one of clarity and of not causing harm to ourselves or other in the daily conditions of life."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "To point to the kind of three words or perspectives or tools, supports, maybe it's a good word, three supports for our practice no matter what kind of practice we're doing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "When the body and mind are relaxed very naturally, we are aware receiving what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "If metapractice is your practice, if you're using the phrases and dropping in the phrases then see how those phrases are received in your system."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "It's allowing what is already here, not fighting with what is already here, not being in conflict with what is already here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "So we'll begin with kind of just scanning through the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "Often that's not something we can do so much, but sometimes there is a way into that."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "Our mind isn't caught up in all its thoughts and worries."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "In fact, that simple instruction."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "Receiving what's already, what awareness is already knowing."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "What is obvious? If you've mostly practiced with the directing of the attention, you can sometimes take some time to let go of that habit and just settle back and be willing to be the passenger like you were the passenger in a car rather than the driver."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "And much like an experience of being a passenger when you're not in charge of the driving, the experience changes dynamically."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "And then another body sensation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "It takes us off of balance."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "Or maybe there's confusion."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "There's not much we can do about the fact that the mind was wandering."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "That can be received as what has arisen."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Are You Aware?", "completion": "And so it helps us to begin to recognize the possibility of a less effortful practice."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "And the ability to check news with the internet, check it regularly, and hope for some new news, good news or something and read whatever, I think fuels the anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "And so, I could stay up well enough with what's going on in popular culture in the world."}

{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "She was such a happy person and it was contagious."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "The chain reaction of evil, hate begets hate."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "That was Martin Luther King."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "Not the confidence that they're going to win the game, they might lose."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "We can have confidence that there is a core within us that has forces of goodness, of love, kindness, peace, generosity and wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "And I kind of believe that deep inside are tremendous forces of goodness that we all have."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "I've seen them all trapped in mutual conflict, and that is why I felt so repelled."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "It's a dart in the heart that makes its victims run all over the place."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "So there's an idea in Buddhism that the forces of suffering that exist within us are kind of like foreign objects in there."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "Whom I encounter, I choose to meet."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "It's not an indifference to the world."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and Lack of Confidence", "completion": "And I have put a lot of confidence that if we learn how to rest in our good hearts and not sacrifice it, not sacrifice our peace and well-being, that then we can be forces of good in the world."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So the sensuality craving is the nucleus for that becoming."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Ajaan, thank you for the talk, the Dharma fire hose that I'm drinking from here."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And the person is saying something unpleasant is like someone who is trying to spit on the earth and dig in the earth and say be without earth, be without earth."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And then because craving is based on ignorance, that's where the delusion would be."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And you grab onto that and you hold onto it to get some sustenance out of it."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "In fact, the five cleaning aggregates, this is the Buddha's definition of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And then he says, okay, in short, it's the five clinging aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And so he takes very good care of what he thinks of what is a beautiful white piece of cloth."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "In other words, we've been feeding off these things without really noticing what we're feeding off of and realizing that without realizing that we're causing ourselves more stress than we need to."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Those are the five aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Finally, consciousness is kind of the bare awareness of these things."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "We'd have no passion for them, we'd have no delight in them, we'd have no desire for them."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It's the fact that they do have offer some pleasure that we actually cling."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And you know what they're saying? You give us a dollar, we'll give you a 93% back."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Is it stressful or easeful? It's stressful."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "We cling to the anticipation of what we're going to get."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "They provide the raw material."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It's still you, your sense of you, that is yourself."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But he never comes back to define what a human being is."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Not because it causes stress and suffering right now, but clinging is what leads to rebirth, and even more suffering after we die."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It was still following around the garden."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Called the goose, the goose turned around, went back, followed him up the stairs."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And all the variations that come with that, it sounds kind of complex."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Kant, I know self through not self."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And the Buddha is basically saying, don't go there."}

{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "This is one of the reasons why you don't see actors and actresses in Hollywood hanging around Theravada monks."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The Dikha Nagaya 15 has a particular way of dividing them up."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "You either identify yourself, I am this aggregate."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "One thing I forgot to mention earlier is these aggregates are actually not things."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "For instance, you are in that activity."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So you're not identifying yourself as the form, but you are in there someplace, running around, taking care of what's coming into the senses."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Another vision you might have is, okay, I have this infinite sense of self and this body belongs to that, which would be the case, okay, the body of form is in consciousness or is in my infinite self."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I am identical with the world."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I mean, just think of all the people in the world that you don't want to be part of."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "What level of reality have I tuned into as much as, what am I doing to maintain this experience? And what if there was nothing done and the experience happened? There was no intention."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "What am I doing? Is there any stress? So you mentioned as part of the view of determinism, one of the, which is an unskillful view, one of the aspects I think you said was a belief that things that you do now can have an effect on what happens to you later."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Okay, just a quick question."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Maybe I don't know much about Buddhism, but you say, I still have trouble thinking of the term, you know, non-self or equal-less or whatever you call."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Non-self? No, non-self means, is this me? You point to something, is this me, is that me? And the answer is no."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Because that question gets you carried away from the practice."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I'm making the eggs and the question is, am I getting any real nourishment out of these eggs? But look a little more carefully at the eggs that I'm putting in the pan."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "It seems that modern science doesn't speak at all about all these extra realms, planes of reality, all these beings like devas and asuras, etc."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But the experience of what is it like for you to be sitting right there right now, they can't describe."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "A lot of things they just can't talk about."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "What the Buddha is talking about is when you go inside and you look at how you experience your body from the inside, how you experience your mind from the inside, and he explores that."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And this is one of the reasons why he takes suffering as his big issue, because that's the big issue inside."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But your issue is about your suffering."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So these planes of reality, are they objective? At the same time, like Milky Way is objective? What makes something objective is that two different people with the same instruments can see the same things."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But then my question is if by doing meditation and going deep inside and developing this extra sensory knowledge we can know about other planes of reality but we still cannot explain how this universe comes about the way science explains."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But yet it's said that the Buddha felt compassion and taught out of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And the question you just asked is a mundane right view question."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "The Buddha is not saying there is nobody there."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So along the lines of what the woman was saying back there about the goose and shaking the leg, so many of our responses are conditioned not only from our early childhood experiences as you said and even from previous generations of experience."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I mean, you stop everything."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And for that, this is one of the reasons why we try to develop our powers of concentration so that just by breathing, you can feel better."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And when it arises, seeing what's causing it to arise, what comes along with it? The second step is seeing it pass away."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And then it comes back to tell you that, oh, you are not, it's like your whole value system may fall in front of your eyes."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Is this actually making me suffer or not? And if this identity is making me suffer, why do I hold on? You have to find where's the allure? What do I find attractive about that identity? Like some people find the identity of a victim as being really, really attractive."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "He talks about four different types of food for consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But then he talks about contact."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "When you are going to do something, so you decide you're going to translate a book."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "I was in Thailand last December, and I went to see the Supreme Patriarch."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "All of a sudden, that means I have to take my identity as a translator."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Apparently, he had a dream one night where he'd composed a symphony in A minor."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "You know, you don't just say no to the king, say, when the king makes a request."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "But it seems like when we are meditating, we are kind of doing that as a training."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "So it seems like we kind of maybe training ourselves to do that."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "If I go for this, what trouble does it entail? And the fifth one is after you've compared the allure with the drawbacks, you realize, I don't really want this anymore and that's called dispassion."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "And how many other things do I have on my plate? Can I add one more thing to my plate and still get all the other things done? What's going to get delayed if I take on this particular task? Do I have the energy? Do I have the time? When it's done, will I feel that it was worth it? Yeah, but about that particular part of like, how do you think is, how do you value whether it's worth it or not? In terms of what kind of value you're like."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Okay, one more question before we stop for the break."}
{"prompt": "Clinging and Craving - Part 2", "completion": "Okay, we can stop for a break."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Not something to try to do, but it's almost like an invitation or kind of inclining towards that possibility and seeing if the mind and body are kind of willing to show us a little bit more softening, a little bit more relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "And from whatever connection to relaxation there is for you in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Aware that there's a breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "Breathing out, knowing that we're breathing out."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Attuning to the Return of Mindfulness", "completion": "So this is kind of the investigation or the curiosity perhaps for this meditation I'd like to encourage you to explore."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And then bring your attention to one of your hands."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "When this exercise is over, you might not pay attention to your hand this way for quite a while."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And they're there because of your aliveness, your vitality, the aliveness of the body's making sensations, and the aliveness of your awareness."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "It can just be there, an emotion, a mood of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "In and of themselves, thoughts are just an experience of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "Practitioners will often go to morgues or anatomy labs or different places in order to directly have contact with death."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "You know, I touched some of the bodies gently."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "Really, there was a freedom there."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And there's a way in which I overlay projections, I overlay ideas, I weave them together with stories and images and stories of the past and the future."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "When I was sitting with feeling my hand in the exercise, I don't know if you could feel it, but I could feel a very gentle breeze against my hand, a little coolness."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "And so, and that's what I wanted to highlight today was this idea of how all these things, all the things which are the symptoms, the manifestation of our aliveness, can be experienced as being free of us, as being free of our desires and preferences."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "You see the world out there because those of you who have eyesight, because you have eyesight."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Self", "completion": "So we engage in the world through one perspective, one way, participate in the world one way."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "But actually, meditation is a particular discipline of training the mind, which is built upon a base of supporting conditions."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And instead of producing friendly and harmonious relationships, they lead to bitter, angry, contentious relationships."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And so simply the practice of meditation and the practice of meditation can join with intellectual knowledge."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "I know faith, the word faith, often it provokes some resistance from Americans who are coming from a dogmatic religious background."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "Goodness, understanding of truth, and freedom."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "But still we always look for ultimate guidance to the Buddha as the one who has understood all of these principles, all of these laws."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "Placing faith in the Buddha and his teaching has a function of clarifying the mind."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And so we have these five positive virtues, compassion, honesty, called a sensual restraint or fidelity, truthfulness, and sobriety."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "We have to develop a wider, more comprehensive understanding of giving, and to understand giving, not merely just making offerings to support the sangha, but we have to develop our hearts to feel the suffering of other human beings within this world in which we live."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And then that will give a great flourishing of joy within the mind."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "But I don't remember what he said, so it has to train the memory."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "Don't just think, I'm going to read so many Dharma books, and if you take the Majumini Kaya, you flip through it, and finish it in a couple of weeks, then thought, okay, I've read the Majumini Kaya, let's see any interesting novels being published, or a history of the Civil War."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And you could even take the notes, read through several times the Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "We also have our human weaknesses and so sometimes we form particular opinions and then we have disagreements, but we know that even though we might have disagreements, we have to be humble about our opinions."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "But one can't always insist that what I believe to be the right action will always work out that way."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "I haven't really looked at the story in a long, long time."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "There might be other factors beyond one's range of knowledge that would throw a different spotlight on the situation."}
{"prompt": "Three Pillars of Practice", "completion": "And so we share these merits with the deities that protect the Dhamma, with the fear spirits that sometimes can be harmful."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So that's one way to divide things up."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And we can also begin to recognize that the pleasantness or unpleasantness is not in the thing seen or the thing felt necessarily."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And it's how we, it's a way of how we navigate the world."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "You know, I don't have to sit here thinking, okay, what's out there? You know, I don't have to do that."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "It's useful, this perceptual process, but it also is misinterpreted and misunderstood."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Often when these emotional qualities are arising, they affect how we want to engage, what we want to do, what our choices are."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so it's like the light of awareness or consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "But then there's some other states of mind, some other things that in the West we wouldn't necessarily think of as emotions."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Because they affect how we relate to things."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "We all have a kind of favorite habitual tendency, tendencies of orientation to the world."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And yet, fortunately, it's not hopeless."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And that will tend to perpetuate and condition the same kinds of habits and patterns that we've had from the past."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "We are fighting, we are kind of, the flow and the habits of conditioning are a very powerful force."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so, you know, the mindfulness gives us an opportunity to kind of intervene in that force and choose a different direction."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Those are physical sensations that are associated with anger."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And at one point I was doing the walking meditation and noticing every pass, I was like, okay, up anger is happening."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And my mind just exploded in rage."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So the anger shaped actually the feeling of the experience of that seeing."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So what we become aware of, what consciousness meets, is affected by the quality of our mind and what we're doing, how we are."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "An agenda is a form of a mental formation, you know, kind of like, okay, I'm going to look for this."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So there was a famous study done, and some of you may have heard about this, looking at it, and this thing that I'm describing right now from the Buddhist perspective of mental formations affect what we take in, how we become aware of things, what we become aware of, what we don't become aware of, has a present day psychological name called selective attention."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so they did this study of having people watch a video that people were playing basketball in the video, and they were asked to count the number of times that the basketball passed between the people in the white shirts."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "It was like right in the middle."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And then they threw in another thing."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Now, this isn't necessarily a problem."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So it's not necessarily a problem."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "They showed the video back."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "That is a dangerous quality of our minds that we can actively deny that our minds are not going to see everything, not going to take everything in."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "This is a natural law kind of of the way our minds work."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "Sometimes it fades more quickly, sometimes it fades more slowly, but it does fade."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And you know, it's funny because that sounds like, and I said this earlier, it sounds like it might be passive."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "We think of like, yeah, I'm okay with things as they are as being, I don't have to do anything to change it."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And then as wholesome qualities meet that, you know, as the greed, the aversion, the delusion, the habitual ways of getting, getting rid of, push, pull, as those begin to fall away, then more wholesome kinds of relationships to experience come up."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "And so, for instance, when we might see somebody being, you know, hurt or harmed, that there's a, you know, there's, that could result in a, in a kind of a, an aversive reaction and an angry reaction and a lashing out against the person who's harming that person, that is one response to that."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "That should not be happening."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "So there's a little assumption embedded in there."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "There's not a lot of choice in the matter for those beings."}
{"prompt": "Shaping the Mind", "completion": "That's how our system is designed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Metta", "completion": "May I be happy and peaceful."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Difficult person is still a bit more challenging."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "It's not that family member that we haven't spoken to for decades."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Instead, you would have figured out how to do it and you wouldn't have any difficult people in your life."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Most people have at least some good qualities alongside what we find challenging."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "So being a little bit sensitive, can we do this with a lot of patience, a lot of space, softening, opening, recognizing that metta has this quality of spaciousness? So if we feel like there's this clamping down, collapsing, is there a way in which we kind of make more space? Whatever way makes sense for you? And this includes going to another category."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "But find whatever works for you."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Okay, so for the guided meditation, just allowing ourselves to get settled into a comfortable position."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Maybe taking a moment to scan through the body and notice those places of tension or tightness and allowing them to soften as best they can."}
{"prompt": "Metta for the Difficult Person", "completion": "Maybe they're just in the doorway."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "In this sitting, I'd like to offer a tool, a tip, something that I've been finding useful in my own practice in the last week or two."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "It's kind of a reminder, a wisdom reminder that I found really useful in terms of supporting a very balanced approach to what's happening in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "If so, you're welcome to just continue with this form of open awareness, form of receptive awareness, practice."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: This is What the Meditation is Supposed to Be", "completion": "It is continuing to practice whatever way supports you right now."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And it's not actually necessary to hold this upright, we can relax that area."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then what's obvious? Again, just connecting to what is being received, what is already here in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And they might not be so conscious that there's a story involved in grief, but it could be very very simple."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "We won't be able to share the things that we shared before."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "Now we don't want to overvalue that simplicity of the present moment and dismiss the stories."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And so now there won't be that caring of me anymore."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And new griefs come along and the stories of those griefs, the meaning of those griefs that take the form of very powerful emotions and feelings might come up and arise as well."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "In mindfulness practice we do something that's maybe unusual and that is we recognize what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "Not to shut that part down, but to put it aside, let it just kind of drift by."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "Feel what's happening in your body in relationship to it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "And so with grief, what's so powerful about this stepping away from the meaning-making, it allows for the deeper aspects of the heart to have more space."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Grief (3 of 5) Grief with and without Stories", "completion": "So probably I'll be with Patachara, the statue of the nun that we have, that some of you probably remember."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "I'll read the other couple of paragraphs and please think about this love that he talks about, not only as romantic love, of course not."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "I don't want to make you suffer."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "If you say this in the voice that communicates your real openness and understanding, the other person may cry."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "We need courage to ask these questions."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "But if we don't ask, the more we love, the more we may destroy the people we are trying to love."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "So both in terms of close relationships, when there's someone near and dear to us, could be a friend, in this case a child or relative, or even friends, colleagues."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "It's just like, so, so a sense of, especially in close real or children, like, oh, you need to satisfy my need to be loved."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Can we ask ourselves this question, see what arises, don't think about it, drop it in, drop the question in."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Into your body, as if a pebble dropped into a pond, resonating, the water resonating, reverberating."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "What is the ultimate expression of care? If you like, you can now bring to your mind, your mind's eye, someone who's near and dear to you, someone you love, care for, their well-being, now with whom you have an easy relationship, perhaps."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Just hurting yourself as if you're holding a young child, a younger version of yourself, just holding this young child, letting it have a tantrum, letting it cry, letting it be angry, just hold it sweetheart."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Just holding the child as long as it's needed for it to be angry with love, with love, not thinking about others, others, but just yourself."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "It's really a, a, a loving warrior practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And I don't find it easy at all."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "There is so much wisdom in that to allow it to, to be and unwind and show you the answers because when we let our confusion, our resistance, our anger, feel safe."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And the last week, I offered every session compassion and meta, bringing in the people in Ukraine, especially and now bringing in Russia."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "And tonight, staying a little more personal, but of course, it's practicing love as service is not a selfish aspect serving all beings."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Real Love", "completion": "Okay, welcome back everyone."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And some of the things that are built into us really aren't necessarily supporting our well-being in any sort of spiritual way."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And so some of this practice is going against our instinctive streams that have a different purpose."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I don't have the black and white hand now."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So if that thorn is taking out, one does not run."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And that's on the handout as well."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So these categories from early Buddhism encompass the immediacy of our experience as sentient beings."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "The susceptibility to clinging is how we respond to them."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "We don't need to identify with what arises in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And so the first color picture on the upper left here, is the blue frontal cortex light blue and just the uncolored posterior cortex C's."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And you can see the low down parts, the brain stem in the lower right, and then the cerebral cortex sitting on top of it, and in between some subcortical regions."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "The next picture on the lower left, in the middle left, I'm sorry, which is a sort of microscopic view of a slice through the cerebral cortex, which has six layers."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "There are other creatures that not nurse, but feed their young that aren't mammals."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And the circuitry of this is being sort of unpacked in modern neuroscience, although there's a lot of things that aren't known about how this circuitry works."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "That's the unit of computation in the cerebral cortex."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And layer five, behavioral output, leaves the cortex."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And this is undeniable when you look at the circuitry of the brain."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "The midbrain, which is a little more sophisticated, a later development sits on top, some regulatory control over the hindbrain, has the same abilities."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And these three regions negotiate among themselves for who's going to be in charge of a particular situation."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "So it's a friendly competition, but there's a redundancy here."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "In terms of evolutionary biology, do you know why that happens? No."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "It involves many parts of the brain, and I think of it as sort of the desktop of consciousness, and different content can be brought to it or removed from it."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "And then put it under the right conditions."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "Yeah, they know what part of the brain has learned to turn that off."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "I'm just wondering if it's held in some cells in some parts of the body and it remembers."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "When you are showing the more structure of the brain, you are kind of showing that they work together, that it's not really separate, but my understanding of practice, meditation, it feels like we are learning to separate them to make sense of it."}
{"prompt": "Neuroscience and Early Buddhism - Part 1", "completion": "But it's also very empowering to change behavior because once I realize that the feeling tone to this experience is negative, it gives me a lot of information on why I'm inclined to do this."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And so the Zen master said, oh, oh, I see, okay, now I get it."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So that you start noticing it more and pay attention to it more and start feeling its texture or its different facets or its value."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And it hasn't happened ever since."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But if you meditate and you get deep into meditation, what stands out in the highlight is these capacities to be aware that becomes more and more important."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And this is the ability to be paying attention enough to what's happening in the present moment with yourself, to be able to consider, understand what is healthy for you to do and what is unhealthy, what is skillful and what is unskillful."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But if we can step back and clearly see my mind is involved in hostility, is that where I want my attention to go? Is that where my attention should go and feed and develop? The Buddha says whatever you do frequently becomes the inclination of the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So we have the ability to give unintentional attention to mental activity."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And one of the things that's useful is to have an attention that, if there is hostility, to have attention that sees it directly, like you look right in the eye, but I'm not going along with you."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "I'm going to look at you and be there, but I'm not going to keep feeding this."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "You clearly comprehend why you're there, what you're doing as you're walking, what's happening to you as you walk, what's going on with your environment around you, who the people are, what the traffic is doing."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But then at some point, kind of waking up enough and say, wait a minute, what's going on here? And then clearly comprehending, oh, this is a mind that is too complacent, drifting off and wandering off here and there."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So the Buddha talked about when you walk, have clear comprehension you're walking."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "It's really something what can happen."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So it's not knowing something, but rather feeling it."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "The more tension that we have, the quality of the attention decreases."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "The richer it becomes, the multidimensional becomes."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "Another term that was very important that's closely connected to the word clear comprehension is to understand."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So we understand the nature of it, that it's a process."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "So these are some of the primary things that are mentioned in Buddha about attention."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "People who are meditators usually at some point learn to really love when the mind is settled in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And so they come and rest at the bottom of the bowl."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And at some point it's purified by equanimity."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "But the goal of this Buddhist practice is not just to have wonderful awareness, but rather to use that awareness for deeper and deeper insight, for wisdom."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "The forces of attachment are kind of like locked in or frozen or something."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "We can get interested in attention and we can shift our attention, we shift our orientation from being preoccupied with all the details of life to being more oriented to the clarity of the awareness that knows those details."}
{"prompt": "The Practice of Attention", "completion": "And so to be able to use our attentional capacity to redirect our thoughts, to redirect where our focus on is a great gift."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And also because I'm finishing up a year-long program that I'm co-teaching, which in experimental, it's kind of like an experimental program that will probably offer some more in the future, some point, that's called a path of fearlessness, where we spent seven months or so looking at fear and considering it, practicing with it."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "When they're afraid, they sit down to meditate, and their fear is there."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "When they're happy or joyful or peaceful or calm, they sit down to be with that."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "So to identify means to define oneself by it."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And if we're really defined by something, by an emotional state, we might know it's there."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "It's kind of like if you're with a friend, you don't want to do all those things with your friend."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "You haven't seen the friend for a while and you want to hear what's happening, what's going on and be with them in a way that's respectful and caring for them."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And it's possible to do that with fear."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "So there's all these ways we say that once we kind of identify, recognize that fear is there, we want to first friend the fear."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And sometimes we need protection."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Maybe if I was different than who I am, I wouldn't be afraid of certain kind of traffic situations."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And so in Buddhism, one of the appropriate fears is the fear of doing something, of oneself doing something that injures one's own integrity."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "So the idea of, we have something to protect here."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And so we keep ourselves in check and close down because of it or collapse."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "And it's possible to feel, and so sometimes it's important to look and see what's the real danger."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "There's nothing concrete right here and now, but in that sense it's imaginary."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "But the idea of there's no need to be a wise and funny person, that's a constructed particular notion, idea."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "But the important principle is to not be caught by the fear so that we can't."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Okay, let's discover what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Because some fears, maybe we can't get rid of it, or we'll always be with us."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "That's the freedom part of fear."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Sometimes the fear is released, and it's no longer there."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Not disassociation from it, but disidentification in the sense that they don't define themselves by the fear, but they're able to sit, be quiet, and breathe easily, perhaps, and recognize, oh, there is fear."}
{"prompt": "The Four Practices of Fear", "completion": "Do we understand what the message is? So thank you very much, and may you explore your fear and discover the wonderful place inside where there is no fear, because it's a place that cannot be threatened."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating Continuity", "completion": "In the guided meditation I was saying you know if you if you're at with the breath it could be that you kind of narrow it down so that there's a little more sense that okay I know I'm present here, I know I'm with the breath, but then rather than trying to be right on top of every little moment, letting the breath come to you."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Just a range, kind of a range from the mild to the extreme."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So that would not be a fear necessarily of safety or of life but of self perception of self."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "There's a sutta that kind of describes a series of thoughts that go through the mind when one is attending unwisely it's said."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "The first thing I want to touch on is what I might call primal fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So one way that anxiety, fear, worry comes about is through thinking."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And we either like it or we don't like it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And we may have a response to that imagination."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So that I think is what anxiety is about, projecting into the future and not being able to envision something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's such a waste of time."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So thoughts actually can generate the fear so that the fear can come up out of thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "We create scenarios in the future and then react to them very much like that tiger a painting of the tiger."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "A kind of fear that is looking at what we're doing and how we're acting and recognizing if I act in this way, this might cause harm this might cause suffering, this might cause damage to me or to somebody else."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I mean, we don't want to just completely just live in the present without noticing looking into the future."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "That's kind of the basic instruction."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And so the one of the main tools in mindfulness is to see if we can let go of the thoughts around an emotion and turn towards the feeling."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And that itself is adding to the fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So we can begin to see, well, where is this coming from? Is it just the painted tiger in my mind that I'm running away from? Is it just some construction in my mind that I think this is going to happen in the future? If that's what's happening, it's really helpful to acknowledge that there's nothing in particular out there to be afraid of."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "One thing that, so if it seems like it's either, it's almost always like under the surface somewhere that sense of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "To actually recognize in your experience when it goes away."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's like, I'm always anxious right now."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Well, if you actually look, you're not always anxious."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Then when it is present, when it is apparent to you, I also find it interesting to explore when I can be kind of present with it and have a little space around it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And then also noticing when it feels like you're just really caught by it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "The distinction between those two is also helpful to notice."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "What's happening right now is I'm feeling a little bit of anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I can just, you know, I can just feel this right now."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "So those three things are really helpful to notice around a state, kind of a habitual pattern of anxiety, worry, or fear."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "They point, a lot around fear can have to do with the sense that things are not stable."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "You know that it's true that things are uncertain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "That we can become more open to the fact that things are uncertain."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And acknowledge that we don't know, but that with our practice we can begin to learn how to meet the unknown."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Because there isn't actually an unknown because, you know, every moment something is arising and we're meeting it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And of course it seems very natural to us because we don't envision any other way of being."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Maybe this is a terrorist act or something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I had my little glow watch."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "At some point wisdom kicked in."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "It's like I need to do some meta."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I need to do some meta here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "What tools are you talking about? I'm primarily talking about mindfulness and turning the attention towards experience instead of our usual response to situation and emotion to be focused out in the world towards what's happening out there to try to fix it, to change it, control it, manipulate it, organize it."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "May all beings be free from anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "Consciously directing my thoughts in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I hate to talk twice in the day, but this is a beautiful story."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "That it's constructed in our mind."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "I don't get immobilized so much, but I think I have something I can offer here."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety Worry and Fear", "completion": "And we do need to stop now because it's 903."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So we're kind of checking in or being curious about, okay, there's struggle happening, so here's the situation, we know the situation, but often I think we think it's the situation that's creating the suffering, and there are aspects of the situation that are contributing to the suffering, but there's a kind of a lynchpin in our own mental habits and patterns, our own mind that is kind of wanting something to be different, wanting to hold on, push away, or just unclear, have a view, an idea, an opinion about what should be here, and that's the piece, that's the place where freedom can happen."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So that's one key way to kind of work with a struggle, check into that relationship and then just be with that relationship."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And in this case, probably directing the attention to something else clearly."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "If that's not possible, then with concentration or samatha."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So that example, that description of practice experience is using the first method that Saito described."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "I mean, if that works, Saito says, that's the first thing to try."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So I'll put my attention on my feet."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So it, I think that's, that's my sense, the final part of the question was I'm curious to hear my experience, my experience with these two ways of practicing with sticky tangles."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And if it doesn't work, I mean, if it feels like the stickiness begins to get the upper hand, then I'll switch to a kind of a focused attention on something on something else."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So, yeah, I think I'll stop there and see if there's any because there's a lot more to say about working with sticky tangles but but that kind of was the topic of the particular question and just see what kind of are there other questions about sticky tangles that might be in the room."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "This is just what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Sometimes that happens for me like that."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Thinking I can't be aware of distracting thoughts and even the word distracting, right? Oh, lots of thoughts happening."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "So it's like, oh, lots of thought happening."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And they don't have to be about what what what we what I shared it could be about any anything."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Alright, I have another question from the form."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "I often think of mindfulness as being very similar."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "It's a function of the mind that brings into conscious awareness what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "And I was noticing the unpleasantness and I knew that I was aware and at some point I got more interested in oh awareness of aversion is happening."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "Aversion is being known aversion is there's awareness of the aversion and when that that kind of that's kind of a wisdom reflection is like oh aversion is being known awareness is knowing the aversion."}
{"prompt": "Working with Sticky Tangles", "completion": "You put something else in there and it reflects that it's not like there's a lingering effect of what was there before on the mirror and mindfulness is very similar."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "And so our own experience teaches us this, but our own experience is a little bit short-sighted because the kind of happiness that we get from that, it's pretty fleeting."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "It gives us a little bit of a sense of okayness."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "This is what happens in our minds when we look at a situation and think, I know that kind of experience."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "We can see that happening in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "So much of the time, I'd say, we simply follow our conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "So the mindfulness begins to give us the, in that small window, mindfulness begins to give us this education about what the actual experience is in the moment when greed is arising in the mind, when aversion is arising in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "How many of us have acted out on that, said something out of anger, and then regretted it, hurting our actions, hurting someone else."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "If we're not mindful in the moment, they're motivated by our prior conditioning, which means often that they're motivated by greed, aversion and delusion."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "We do this consciously sometimes, but this is also happening just very quickly in our system."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily happen immediately."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "Or maybe this time the greed won't lead to that tension."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "But it doesn't actually take as long as it might seem."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "It's not a lot of time for comments or questions."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "And you're welcome to unmute yourselves."}
{"prompt": "Why do we Have These Habits of Greed, Aversion and Delusion?", "completion": "You can try to unmute yourselves."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "There can be attitudes that grieving is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "Or there can be attitudes that we need to grieve."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "But at some point we can ask ourselves, what is my attitude? What's my belief about this grief? What relationship do I have towards it? And moving towards having a simpler and simpler relationship to it, where we're not adding layers of relatedness and judgments and ideas about the grief, and in a sense liberating the grief from these imposition of these attitudes and relationships and needs and fears that we might have in relationship to grief itself."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "To begin teasing apart the different elements of it, and seeing that we have attitudes, we relate to it, we bring a certain kind of desires, wishes, fears, attachments to all these different component parts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: (5 of 5) Liberating Grief", "completion": "And this increased capacity is directly connected to giving freedom to our experience, giving freedom to the world, giving freedom to our feelings, and maybe dropping the idea that you will be free, but rather that there will be freedom given to all things."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "So these are some meditators, researchers who devised a way of assessing personality based on an ancient kind of Buddhist system of classifying ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "The mind that withdraws from what is unappealing or the mind that ignores."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "Now I'm a little reticent to ask, but would anybody want a hazard, I guess, on my type? Aversion, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "It's characterized by a lack of awareness of present conditions, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "On the negative side, the diluted type can seem lost, constantly scattered, and prone to following the opinions of others because of uncertainty."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "In some ways, I feel like over the course of my Dharma life, I've trained myself to pay attention to those alarm bells."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "The alarm bell goes off and it's like that really."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "I was just sitting retreat and the teacher said something like, if you're not becoming more humbled by this path, you're not growing."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And it necessitates a lot of courage and humility."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And to do this, to establish this sense of willingness, we first have to get over a certain kind of shame in not knowing there's a kind of disorientation when the rug is pulled out from under our self understanding."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And if you don't, you won't, yeah? But at the same time, so it was a kind of theme on the retreat I was just on, like, we can't fake curiosity, yeah? Do you know that experience of, like, you're with yourself and you know you're supposed to be mindful? I'm a meditator, I'm supposed to be aware, I'm supposed to be interested in phenomena, but you're so not, you know."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And a lot of Dharma practice is actually noticing with more and more subtlety what we actually believe, or what our behavior conveys about our beliefs, our commitments, what it conveys about how we think we will be happy, what we think will end the seeking in the heart."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "It's my delusion that allows me to kind of like pull a fast one and like explain away patterns of greed and aversion of clinging."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And but sometimes we're just recapitulating the same mind state of ruminative delusion."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "In the language of Buddhist psychology, you lack clear comprehension, samphijanya, of what is being called for and how you might respond to that call."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "And usually we kind of close down around moments like that, but there is an opportunity actually to look like what delusion was I resting upon."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "One of the effects of that for me is like the sense, like it feels like the way I do everything is like the natural way to do it, like the preordained way."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "So of course this is where you put the toothbrush, right? So the bizarreness of our choices and lives and commitments and values is highlighted by seeing other people or cultures where people just do things differently."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "That I came up with something this morning, actually."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I'm going to Spirit Rock, then after that, Mexico, then Uganda, then this."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I haven't seen someone who's vegan."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "He said that he's Jewish, and he didn't know about meditation at all."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I said, what's amazing? This guy was giving me all these things."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then after 20 years, this guy learned about Buddhist meditation, he went to Zen center."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "You just keep on cruising."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Now you know where you are."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Then you are on a retreat."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Another one was a prime minister."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Many things Buddhists say are very similar to what I am studying in Christianity, but I love Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I said, you know, just meditate a minute."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then try to see the emotional background."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So whenever they actually become mindful of their thoughts, there is that inclination, that leaning forward."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "But if you are the person who is thinking like that, that might help."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "But are there other thoughts that are called judgmental thoughts? Is that familiar to you? Yes, comparing."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "But when you are judicious, that means you are designing, you are making informative decisions and comments about something."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I shouldn't make judgment."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Now, another thing is the teaching on karma, the love karma, is that if you see somebody doing something, so finally it's their karma."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "If you are thinking about all the time confusion, then you substitute it with thoughts of wisdom and understanding, right? Thoughts of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So I always want to go to the source."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "It took me to a cemetery where they don't bury people or cremate."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Those monks would meditate and tigers come and say, I thought they are going to come, actually."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Is it something that is familiar to you? All right, so that's the first technique."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "That means next time that thought arises, it will be stronger."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "They don't frequent you, in other words."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Why am I the person who's actually trying to push away things? Then it's because of ignorance."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "If you were wondering how do you control the thoughts, I would substitute how do you work skillfully with thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Because we are so much used to control what we don't like."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So if we can actually put that way, that's very helpful."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Yes, it was part of my plan, but we know there was not time."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "I was going to go into the area, like sometimes as thought arises, they trigger certain emotion when you have pain and then the emotion arises."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "If this fails, go to this one."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And you start enjoying your movie, mental movie."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "But in a short time, that's what I can offer."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "That's why I kept on talking."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "So I had more experience here and there, and I would give examples teaching in the prison and all that."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "Actually, as the Buddha said, he's teaching like this theory, practice, and realization."}
{"prompt": "Enjoying Your Thoughts", "completion": "And then when I was in Thailand meditating in the cemetery, in the cemetery, and then these lines were coming and all this kind of thing."}

{"prompt": "The Breath: A Vehicle for Liberation (part 1)", "completion": "In other words, if you take the teachings and you put them into practice, then it becomes something more than what you've just heard."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "My energy is aroused and unsluggish."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And so what he's pointing to, there's different ways you can interpret it, but how I read it, he's pointing to the fact that Anuruddha, even though these are extremely wholesome states that he's experiencing, things that are very, very positive and significant, he's pointing out how these are all conditioned qualities."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And so it's like there's a famous Zen story that comes to mind where there's a monk in a Zen monastery who's being extremely, like Anuruddha, extremely impressive and committed in his meditation, he's always sitting up late into the night and in his meditation he's always sitting straight as a poker, absolutely resolute, incredibly helpful, hard worker, doing all the right things."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And then one day he's out working in the garden and he sees the Abbot, the Zen master, sitting down at the end of the pathway on a bench and he's not quite sure what he's doing and as he sort of mindfully sweeps the rest of the path and gets up closer and closer, he sees that the master is sitting there polishing something and then he gets up closer and closer and he sees he's polishing a brick and then he's supposed to be working, sweeping the path mindfully, but after a while he sees the Abbot sitting there working away on this brick and he thinks, what is he doing? And finally he can't resist asking the question and finally brings his hands together and says, Venerable Sir, Ajahn, Roshi, what is it that you're doing? I've been sweeping the garden for ages and you've been sitting there on this bench."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And then gets up and walks off, leaving the aspiring student with the shiny brick."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Those of you who studied with him, he'd say, only joking, only joking, or not joking."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And so that it's a job to really cultivate that quality of non-bias in relationship to the conditioned world."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Then there's that letting go."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "The Buddha had temptations by Mara, and it's just before his enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But can you mention how we're supposed to, should we just think, well, just touch on Mara and then leave it alone, or what should we do? I'm not sure exactly what you're asking."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So that's pretty easy to remember the title of."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But it's a strange mixture, you know? And again, quoting Ajahn Chah, he was very good at these nifty one-liners."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So it's mysterious, because Ajahn Chah was an extremely kind of proper monk."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Like the question about loving our dear ones or weeping when they die."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "There's no monks in this hall."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "We've got to do this and we shouldn't do that and this is right and that's wrong and we've got to create all the good karma possible."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "People tend to weep when certain things are done."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But it's, that can be experienced without any kind of clinging whatsoever."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Here because, some Samana or Brahmin, with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters, essential pleasure, and with the surmounting of the rapture of seclusion, unworldly pleasure and neutral feeling, they regard themselves thus, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "That a target of bhikkhus understands this thus, this good Samana or Brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and future and so on, they regard themselves thus, I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "I understood there is this, seeing the escape from that, the Tathagata has gone beyond that."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "It's completely, as a total mindfulness, but it's also a mindfulness which is not caught up with any kind of delusion or it's not carried away."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So the Buddha used this kind of phraseology of unsupported consciousness so that consciousness that does not land on anything or does not settle or is not established any place or also in a similar way is like the consciousness which nothing can land upon."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So it goes on up to the Tava Tingsa heaven, where is it that the four great elements cease without remainder? Ooh, don't know about that, but you better ask up in the Yama devas and then all the way out to the celestial chain of command, up into the Brahma heaven so it approaches the devas of Brahma's retinue."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Avija is ignorance, Vija is knowing or awareness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": ", confine no footing, is very striking."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Which four? Physical food, gross or refined, contact is the second, consciousness the third, and intention is the fourth."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "When there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food, when there is no delight, no craving, then consciousness does not land there or grow."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "In the same way when there is no passion for physical nutriment, contact, consciousness or intention, consciousness does not land or grow."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So that has a little bit of a different tone to it."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And I did the intro to the original one which is called Intuitive Awareness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And he tends to use consciousness more often than not as a transcendent awareness."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Just to help clarify that."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "And his own, his phrase, intuitive awareness, that's his translation of Sati Sambha Janya, which is usually mindfulness and clear comprehension."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "That whole paragraph was very confusing several months ago when I read that."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So in that very taking a stance, it's like landing on it, taking hold of it, becoming identified with it."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "He would, he passed away now, where he would come and lead retreats there every summer."}

{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "This sphere I call neither a coming, nor a going, nor a staying still, neither a dying, nor a reappearance."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "But again, it's important not to just sort of react to our own habitual perceptions and not thinking this is some sort of really super-duper bleak heaven."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Nam is water, lai is to flow and ning is to be still."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "This somato is your place of non-abiding."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "How is that? How do I feel that? How do I experience that? What do I do with that? So that you're actually not just taking these words as a remote philosophical statement, but finding that place within your own being where there is no evolution, no basis, whether it's that kind of groundless quality of non-abiding."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "Okay, so if there's a question or two on that, then we can have that and then we'll."}
{"prompt": "Nibanna - The Island (part 2)", "completion": "So in this passage on page 156 where we go through this description of it neither being this nor that, neither perception or non-perception, et cetera, et cetera."}

{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And there's a lot of, a wide range of teachings they give."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And we're perplexed by all these things that you're teaching."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "How do you find your way? So that's what the Buddha was asked."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "He answered it in terms of the way he thinks and the way he looks at the world."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "I don't really believe it's the truth and better than your truth or something."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "You didn't go to the library to learn about the teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So don't go by oral tradition, just because it's spoken by the tradition that you're in."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And then by collection of scriptures, just because it's in a book, even a Buddhist book, you know, I spend a lot of time reading these kinds of books, but to take it, just because it's in the book, it's true, you can rely on, you know, the Buddha says, you know, be careful, don't do that."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And also our ability to know for ourselves sometimes is a little bit suspect because we interpret things a lot."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "And so this idea of, it's possible to naively think you're relying on yourself when it's not a reliable source of information or understanding in this regard."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So the Buddha is much more interested in behavior than he is in belief."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "So if it's unskillful, if it causes harm and suffering, that's relatively easy for many of us to believe and to understand."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "It causes harm and suffering for me to have it."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "But actually a very important part of this meditation practice is that we start having insight or understanding into what is skillful and what is harmful."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "What is unskillful, what is harmful, what is skillful, and what is beneficial."}
{"prompt": "The Pebble in Your Shoe", "completion": "I see now what I'm doing, and now I can do something about it that I see it."}

{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "We can act in ways that are stressful, and we can act in ways that are peaceful, that are non-stressful, calm."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "It was a little bit stressful to do it because the tension and the hurry and one more thing, one more thing."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And so as we kind of notice the impact of how we do things is on ourselves, we might learn that there is a peaceful way of doing it so that at the end of doing it, we actually feel more settled, more calm, more present than we were before."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So the very doing we do is nourishing, supportive, creates a kind of a beautiful environment internally for ourselves, physically, mentally, emotionally."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So maybe by accident you find yourself calm in meditation one day and you're very familiar with your agitation that comes out of thinking about certain things."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "It's clearly, it's better that way."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "As we settle in and become more present with mindfulness and mindfulness, at some point mindfulness is just staying in the present moment with present moment experience and we start seeing that the mind leaves to start thinking about something else."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "Maybe something really important, maybe the war in Ukraine, from your meditation spot in California."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "If someone asked me, you know, when should I be mindful? I would respond when it's the best alternative available."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "To be distracted, caught up in thoughts, preoccupied is not really a healthy state to be in."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "We have a choice about whether to stay with the action of being mindful or going along with the actions of being stressful, being agitated, being worried, being anxious, being angry, being greedy and wanting."}

{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "So I'm supposed to go off there."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "And so in one way or the other, some of us will have very strong ideas, beliefs that were supposed to be, or it's good to be, angry, anxious, greedy, conceited with what we do."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "There's all these reasons why people feel like they're supposed to be angry."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "To prevent, maybe there are things you should avoid doing entirely."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "But it turns out that whenever you're doing alcohol the next day, you're not quite up to your usual self, to your full self, in a good way, and you tend to say things you later regret, because you get more casual or you're kind of tired or something."}
{"prompt": "Actions Bring Peace", "completion": "The second is to prevent yourself from getting involved with things which are unhealthy for you, in body, speech, and mind."}

{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So over the last many weeks, we've been looking at the fornable truths in the Eightfold Path and continuing that conversation."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And the Buddha had recognized that that path, the practice of denying and mortifying the body was not going to answer the question he had."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And he said, the ending of that craving is the ending of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And that's kind of in the first two aspects of the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "That's where we have some degree of a capacity to change our minds, change the way our minds relate."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "But it's not hardwired in us as humans, unlike for some animals."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "We have enough capacity in our minds to choose when we understand this direction of choice, the motivation behind this, perhaps motivated by greed, aversion, delusion."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "When we see those with mindfulness, we feel into that actually hurts here and now."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So then that the middle path is this one of opening to the experience."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "But they are, maybe they're more motivated by delusion or they, they're heading in the direction of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so these things include things like trading in human beings, um, trade, participating in killing beings."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So in the, the speech, I'm trying to find my way back to this."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And, and maybe allow some of those to help us wake up a little bit in this area of speech."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So that this kind of little bit of stilted quality of, did you really finish speaking? Okay, and then there's a pause."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "So this kind of speech can be motivated from greed, aversion or delusion greed."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "Um, and is there another way to say what you're going to, to say what you're going to say."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "I don't have to say, I can't do it then."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "But also it begins to cultivate a kind of a commitment to truth, a kind of an integrity."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "What is the motivation for saying something? So it's not just about the motivation when we're, when we're getting ready to engage in one of these kinds of false speech or, or harsh speech or divisive speech or idle chatter."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "This, you know, this, this separation speech that's intended to divide rather than unify."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "We begin to cultivate that care and courtesy."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "And so the speech of, oh, isn't it beautiful weather today or whatever the, the words may seem idle, but the intention behind it is a kind of a resonance in coming together."}
{"prompt": "Wise Speech: Part 1", "completion": "I mean, we couldn't, we can crave for something to happen."}

{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And the question is sort of like, all right, well, how much do the teachings change in tone, in emphasis, based on the sociopolitical moment? How much do they change? And to some extent, this gets us into the terrain of traditionalist adaptationists, what we could call adaptationists, those who are maybe lean more in the kind of, I don't know, fundamentalist direction or those who are actively trying to adapt teachings to integrate other bodies of knowledge to address new concerns."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "There is something like, I have been actively trying to tailor teachings to this moment, and that does mostly feel right, like some of the teachings, some of the ways of pointing out things from our tradition, it can almost feel like a kind of empathic failure to be on Zoom during a pandemic and say, see, the Buddha told us so."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And there's some recognition that it's possible, that my heart is being blown around by the moment in ways in which I've been unaware, and that doesn't make me regret how I've been teaching or anything like that, and it doesn't make me walk it back at all."}

{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "The dharma is not about putting out every fire, but cultivating a heart such that fire is less likely to ignite, and over the years it's not so much that I feel like I'm making choices that help extinguish the fires of dukkha, but actually tending to my heart, cultivating a heart that is less susceptible."}
{"prompt": "Preparing Citta not to Burn - IRC Mini-retreat", "completion": "And in doing this, we generate a kind of surplus of well-being, it's well-being that needs to be spent, and we spend it on others."}

{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "So we commented on how the last couple of years have been a wonderful opportunity for practice, and particularly Gil's 7 o'clock meditation and Dharma talk every morning, and the hope that at least some hybrid of that will continue after this is over."}

{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "There was wisdom in generosity, giving it all away, wisdom in ethics, not harming, we're all equal, there's wisdom in all, wisdom in joyful effort to be here."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "And if just right to the website IMC senior sangha, we will get back to you with the logistics of how to get into a small group."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "Maybe we could be back by 1215."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "I'm sort of focusing on this topic right now."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "In our practice, we begin slowly and gradually to sort of look at that."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "So you're just minding your own business, having a cup of tea, sitting in the garden and suddenly a thought crosses your radar screen and you feel this contraction in your solar plexus or you have a body, mind response, which is where did this come from? So it's like we fall out of lucidity or the ability to be aware that we are present with ourselves and what presence feels like and then we wake up in a dream or we find ourselves in a dream that we, when we're dreaming it and we don't realize that we're lost there, it seems like it's real."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "So if we're thinking in a negative way, those memories are going to be difficult and if we're thinking in some lovely ecstatic happy way, those memories might have that kind of a spin but that's basically what's happening and there's this quality of the dream feeling real."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "Now what does this have to do with this moment of transition? Well it really has everything to do with the moment of transition, because the proximate karma is the one where we have the most control, so if we learn how to control our minds, if we learn the ways that our minds are programmed, so to speak, or we start to pay attention to those moments of transition and we don't lose mindfulness and just over and over and over again slip into fantasies of this, that, or the other thing, we can actually transition from sleep, from waking state into sleep with a kind of presence or lucidity."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "So all of this seems pretty heady in a way, but when we're practicing whether we're sitting in meditation or we're making an inquiry into the nature of our experience and we notice that we have lost ourselves, it's just to remember yourself and start again."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "And then the next person might say thank you and then they would say I experience not knowing as in this way and then the third person will say that and the fourth person will say that and then you'll just keep circling through your group for about three or four or five minutes and asking that question and then I'll prompt you to move to question number two and then if we have time I'll prompt you to move to question number three."}
{"prompt": "Senior Sangha Meeting for February 2022", "completion": "You're not putting me on the spot I'm having a little trouble with your audio but I think what you asked for was are there books on this subject and there's libraries of them but was your question about the four comma I put it in chat so that it gives you a kind of a brief definition of them so if you open it open your chat icon at the very bottom of the screen and then scroll down to the last entry and that's it's from me to everyone and there's there's Robert it's not there he's asking for a book recommendation Robert do you know any books well there's many books why don't you stay on for a few minutes yeah happy to happy to Robert I just want to be giving you feedback Robert that there is whatever you put in the chat is not right now it's not showing up correct well it shows up in my chat I guess when we go to breakout rooms once you if you've done it at that time then it won't be on here all right just a second so so once we came back that chat's gone he wrote down the four comma let's try this again did it show up yes yes yes okay thank you oh thank you welcome all right um anybody else I mean time is short what was it like you actually do this exercise about not knowing and to do it in that particular way what did you notice I did this last night in a group in Nikki's class and it was really fascinating no it didn't it didn't fascinate any of you it's hard to answer about the it's hard to answer about the topic versus the technique Robert okay so I'm a I'm a I just want to offer you I'm a professional educator I teach teachers how to teach better so if you ever want to contact me about that but I like that I appreciate your offer yeah thank you I appreciate your offer gail thank you the main feeling I kept coming to was openness it just it was a very opening feeling was losing ideas of what was going on and in that way they were open to possibilities and awareness just especially losing losing the ideas was was an opening and good experience a little scary but seems beneficial great thank you thank you so just being present with that quality of being in a place where you don't actually know what's happening yeah not resisting okay so maybe maybe just as a thought what's being known there is this quality of non-resistance you see where you're not pushing against something you're just allowing whatever is happening to happen because awareness knows what's happening but we think that something should be happening and when it's when we think it's not our thought that it's not is an expression of resistance and that is where mindfulness gets lost or recognized thank you gail Gloria so I really like this exercise and I found that we could each go deeper and deeper into the exploration and a lot of different feelings were involved maybe way down underneath was fear but on top of that could have been anger anxiety shame and so forth but really came back to beginner's mind and just being okay about not knowing being a beginner and start anew right and that's the whole that was the whole point of the teaching that I gave when this happens you just meet it with beginner's mind instead of the mind of the expert and you start anew as I shared with you on previous occasions Bicubodi says the secret to enlightenment is to start and continue over again start and continue I love it okay so we are after the hour right now and I want to honor our closing at one I wish that we had more time I will stay on for just a few minutes afterwards if people want to hang but for people who need to leave please feel free to do that and please join us next month again and if you're part of the book groups and groups that meet with David enjoy the next meeting which I guess will be in two weeks David were there any announcements that you wanted to send anybody off with or you're on mute brother I just just like to make a dedication of whatever merit has accrued here whatever wisdom or warmth or compassion or kindness or freedom whatever merit that has been felt here that has been accumulated here may we dedicate this merit to the happiness of all beings may all be everywhere be happy may all beings everywhere be liberated from their clinging from their suffering may all beings everywhere abide in a happiness that knows you may all beings everywhere abide in equanimity free from clinging and free from hatred okay thank you all it's a great to have you here together with us and hope to be able to see you see you next month thank you so much thank you thank you thank you everyone have a great thank you be well and happy make good care of yourself and stay safe you too and thank you Robert David thank you Gail good to see you sir thanks Gail."}

{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "One of the reasons also, you know, you've probably, a lot of times, you know, as we practice and, you know, you know, you might talk with a teacher, you know, and, you know, they often point out that's the narrative, you know, what's going on inside you now, not the story, not the narrative."}

{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "But afterwards, when he told the story, basically the concert was ruined."}
{"prompt": "Delusion", "completion": "It was ruined, because we tend to, we tend to take endings, and you know, and create our narratives, giving the ending of a narrative more weight."}

{"prompt": "Different Ways of Seeing", "completion": "I feel quite inspired because when the boundaries dissolve, if we really care deeply about our own well-being, how can we not care about the nature around us, the people around us? After all, we can't find the boundaries so solidly."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "So the second step of the Eightfold Path is having a certain disposition, certain intention, certain approach, certain way of thinking."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path: Finding an Ancient Path", "completion": "In the end, when there's a distinction being made between the Eightfold Path and what's called the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Noble Eightfold Path is when you have become the path."}

{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's like something we're putting on top of what we already are."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Our views, our being right, our possessions, our feelings."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I don't actually want to live as a separate person who's getting their point across."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And to feel that and invite it to soften, invite it to soften and open."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And hear their point of view."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And to break down, like, let go of that attachment to me and my view."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And, you know, it's a little bit risky, maybe."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And you might wonder why would anybody want to break down that solid sense of self? It feels good."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So when we contemplate that, it just starts to question, well, why am I doing this again and again? And we do the same thing, the same response, the same pattern."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I mean, I do all of those in a day, you know, numerous times."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And I'll maybe see if I can give it up next time that desire arises."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's a feeling, a craving."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So we can start to steer our tendencies in a more wholesome direction."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It happens not because you're trying to create a good person, make yourself into a good person, but because you're seeing the suffering of following unwholesome mind states, unwholesome speech, unwholesome actions."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then one half they said, go out and buy something for yourself with that money."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And how happy did that make you on a scale of 1 to 10? It was like maybe happy for a little moment but not for very long."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And even though we were just kind of starting here, we had virtually nothing ourselves just at the very beginnings and Buddhist global relief was starting and we felt like this is a really, really good thing."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "It's got really good ethics, it's got a very broad understanding of the causes of poverty and food insecurity."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So you can get a lot of joy from doing something because it's a good thing to do and you feel good about it and you can tell people, hey, I did that and I feel really good and that is good too."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And you just keep investigating, keep allowing those little moments to open and don't judge the rest of the times when it's not happening, just know it."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So then you're going to be with a lot of anxiety which is unpleasant and you don't want to be there."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "There's thoughts, there's movements towards and away from things."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And then a toddler and then a child and then a teenager and then an adult and then going through these different things and your face has changed, your hair has changed, your body has changed."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So things like that just like questioning the truth of identifying with what's actually going on."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Because what's actually going on doesn't necessarily change."}

{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And you can go through them and see which ones pass and which ones fail and so forth."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "So any advice? I'm not sure if I can give you the right advice but when it's true giving, it is joyful."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Because people bring flour, yeast, fruit, various things."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I'm really tired because I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning on Saturday."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I don't know, just really inspired to get involved in this very."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "I kind of feel at that point, for me there's a sense of self just kind of dissolves actually in any sense of me giving to somebody in need sort of disappears."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "And there's really just a sense of."}
{"prompt": "Renunciation Of Self", "completion": "Because I think that's a very good thing and also if you're going to give to a charity to know that they're working well."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "And as you might have heard, dependent arising, dependent origination, different ways is translated."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "Samupada is the Pali word."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "And from that feeling tone, then, if we don't see, notice it, then craving arises."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "Upadana, there's a sense of, oh, it's really, we solidify, we really hook up, we cling to it, we close our wrist."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "You start noticing how the mind is labeling so many experiences with Vedana, with feeling, tone."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "However, let's acknowledge and be aware that the way we have evolved, evolution, the best, evolution wants us to live long enough to pass down our genes."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "It's not interested in our happiness or unhappiness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "And not to be a marionette, this doll that has strings attached to its body and is being pulled this way and that way by all these feeling tones."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "And when you see what's beyond them, you see how the sausage is made."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "So my invitation for today is if you would notice when Vedana arises, perhaps before it leads to the other steps, to the tanha, to the thirst, to thirst, and to attachment, to clinging."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Vedana in the Cycle of Dependent Arising", "completion": "And now the mind wants to avoid it, push it away."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "You know, the conflict in a human species, in our human civilization is old."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And what the Buddha was addressing, his teachings address, is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "Not by repressing it, not by pretending it's not there, not by kind of leaning in and kind of buying into some of those states of mind, but by being curious about them, that perspective I offered in the guided meditation of allowing being present with this is a way that there can be a transformation connected with conflict."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "This is really in many ways, you know, the first noble truth the Buddha spoke of, the noble truth of suffering."}

{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "And so how do we, how do we understand this? How do we, how do we explore it? There's a, a definition of dialogue that feels appropriate to me to bring in, because it does feel like we need to understand each other."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "Rather than trying to convince or proselytize or resolve a conflict, the primary goal of dialogue is to understand more deeply other perspectives."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "The initial task is to grasp the other's position in the strongest possible light."}
{"prompt": "Conflict and Non-conflict", "completion": "To understand the perspective of that conflict."}

{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "May you be happy and have joy in your heart, dear one, you can add their name if you wish to make it more personal, dear so and so."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "May you be healthy and strong."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "May you be free from your challenge."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It's changing as we speak."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "A few people are making a note of that."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, so like we said, Nikki and I were kind of experimenting, so we'll work with this."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, I think I inadvertently sent a chat to everybody."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "She and I were chatting about how we were going to adjust the schedule and she said, why don't you go to this room? And then so we're, you know, we're all in this together."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I didn't get the chat to run out."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And so thank you very much for, for this."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "We really are all of us in this together, all of us."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I think Joana had her hand up first, right? Yeah, sorry."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I just wanted to express my appreciation for the two of you leading this retreat."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And it just really, really filled my heart, you know, really gave me that, oh, wow, I'm home, you know."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And there's a talk, I was attending a few years ago at the Mind and Life Institute, and she was saying that, okay, doing this, the compassion, research and compassion, she had this renowned mark, a renowned monk, Matthew Ricard, in the fMRI machine and told him, okay, don't do compassion meditation, just contemplate suffering of the world."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Let me do the full compassion meditation, not just contemplate the pain of others."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So then Nikki maybe you'd like to add to that and I liked what you said."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So hearing that, um, what I would say is meta can be a lot of different things actually."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It can, the feeling can arise a feeling of love and care, but not necessarily actually for everyone."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "What's your feeling? Oh, you're muted, my dear."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So I just wanted to say a little bit more about this idea of meta and compassion."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Okay, I'll continue here and then maybe I'll explore."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "But it can be really important to highlight that self-compassion can be an antidote to this idea of a critic, the self-critic, the inner critic that sometimes arises, this feeling of I can't do it or I don't deserve to feel okay when so many other people are having difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "But instead, can we orient ourselves towards our difficulties, towards our challenges? Acknowledge that's the truth of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Of course, of course, there's difficulties."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And can we turn towards them, align with them in some kind of way, with a warm heart, with a sense of care, with a sense of goodwill towards ourselves? Even if what we're experiencing is some anxiety, some fear, can we take care, can we hold this anxiety, this fear, whatever our experience might be? Can we hold it with a sense of it's okay? It's okay."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So with that as an introduction, we'd like to bring yourself, I'll start a guided meditation, bring yourself to an alert upright posture that also expresses care, that also expresses self-care."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I'll highlight a few places where we often hold tension around the eyes, around the mouth, and the shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "You might check in with the body and see if there's a sense of ease or some type of inner smile."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "This practice is powerful, even if during the actual meditation practice, you don't have a strong or clear experience of loving kindness."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Now we'll build on this foundation of loving kindness for a level being and expand it to include ourselves, of course we're going to include ourselves, for a level being too, of course we are."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Maybe we had a little bit of a conflict with someone, maybe we've been feeling anxiety."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "To support this, we can use different phrases for compassion."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "May I experience well-being."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "We might see it when it arises when we see somebody who needs some help or when we touch into when we're on the phone talking to family members or friends."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It may just naturally arise."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It shouldn't feel like this is what a good person would do."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "How are you what's coming up, please raise your hand or either yes Nancy you have your hand up and unmute you."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I like that expression quite a shake up."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, I had has been up for a while."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So that seems to be maybe similar to this empathic distress that you have used."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So it's it's kind of turns the practice on its head and and releases all it."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "There's a, and maybe kind of getting a bit smaller with our attention, as opposed to a warm heartedness, which is a little bit leaning forward and an openness, like, may there be, it's just like this wish for things to be better."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "And really self-care, self-compassion, self-lops, especially going through the different stages of grief, just giving yourself space and time."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I could really appreciate a very warm feeling."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I trust that because self-compassion practice is fairly new to me, I trust it will come in time."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I just wanted to share that, and thank you."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Peggy, your hand has been up, please."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "But it was easy to have compassion for myself in that."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, it's not always easy to maintain when I need to deal with this person sometimes if there's a clash and find a skillful, compassionate way for both of us to interact."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Christine, please, I'll unmute you."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "I don't like you, but I can love you."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It helps me feel socially connected, and I love it."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, I think that it's, as Nikki mentioned, the words that we use can make a difference."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "He, she is alive right now."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So just be right here right now and meet this moment with presence."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Also, I'm very grateful for this kind of mini retreat."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So just tune into when these experiences naturally arise, feel them in the body, tune into how they feel in the mind and that just makes it more likely that they will arise again."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It might be that they've been arising for some time already and we've been a little bit dismissive of them, especially we tend to do this, especially in the midst of a global pandemic."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Yeah, as Diana said, turning the mind, turning the heart and actually cultivating, really making time for cultivating joy in the midst of all this."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "So you're going to be bombarded by ads, but I will put the link here anyway here."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "Sorrow everywhere, slaughter everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "With flies in their nostrils."}
{"prompt": "Loving Heart, Resilient Heart: AM, Kindness and Compassion for Loved Ones and Ourselves", "completion": "It's a particular perspective."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "And so allowing the body to relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "And then sometimes it's also possible to kind of attune internally and kind of see if there's a way to soften."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "In fact, being aware is a very normal part of our humanity."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "Awareness just receives what is here."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "And at times it may seem very simple, and yet the power of mindfulness comes with this capacity to be aware moment after moment, beginning to reveal how one moment shapes the next moment."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "And sometimes that shaping seems simple, not so important."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Awareness of our Human Experience", "completion": "And yet it's not our job to find what we think of as important conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "But the Buddha says, no, look more carefully."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "It's that sense that it's just one thing or that experience is just one thing that actually keeps us stuck in ways."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "So without this knowing quality, without mindfulness, just by nature of our bodies and conditioning, evolutionary history, without mindfulness maybe we could say that every pain is unbearable and every pleasure irresistible."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "When you look at it empirically, when you look at how well we know ourselves, it's a little humbling."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "This is the psychologist, Erica Carlson, who writes, Despite the privileged access we have to our feelings, thoughts and behaviors, informational and motivational barriers often prevent us from seeing ourselves as we really are."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "Who knows? This not knowing is not a quality of bewilderment."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "It's actually like a breath of fresh air, an openness of mind."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "It wouldn't hurt if we're wrong."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "The Dharma is always an adventure in this way."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "But on this path, nobody actually says you need to know."}
{"prompt": "Knowing and Not Knowing", "completion": "So knowing and not knowing."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "And knowing it peacefully a little bit sets us free from it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "And so the peace can just spread and grow more and more."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "Whereas peace comes from release."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "And I've swum in water, which was you couldn't see for more than a foot in front of you."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "And I'd love to go dive underwater, maybe about five or six feet, and hold my breath, turn around on my back, and look up at the waves and the turmoil above."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Conditioned Consciousness (2 of 5) Tension and Peace", "completion": "So fear is a danger to ourselves, and fearlessness is how we become safe from ourselves, where we're not going to cause harm to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "And if those ruminations are tinged or filled with fear, then it's no wonder that people are chronically anxious because of these kinds of thoughts that are kind of disturbing us or conditioning us or affecting us."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "And so one of the important aspects of mindfulness practice is to get wise about thinking."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Use it to say, what would be helpful for you so that you're more able to be disentangled from your experience? How do you be present so you're not so caught and lost in your thoughts and really here in present? How do you use thinking to quiet your thinking? How do you use thinking so thinking doesn't obscure the present moment for you? So that's a little bit the task of this talk is to try to talk about that."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "I had one teacher who I had a question about something or other and I started my question with the phrase, what do you think? You know, it was innocent enough."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "The teacher shot back and said, I tried not to think."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "So to have this one policy about thoughts is not very helpful."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "What it most often has to do with the past, with the future, or something which is not present here or now."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "A lot of people who spend a lot of time planning are often planning around something that's connected to the world of fear and anxiety and worried about what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "I'm kind of like, you know, a major character in it."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "But to be caught up in discursive thought is not very helpful for the quieting, the calming, the stealing of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Some people have woken up from their, the spell of their fantasy."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "So it was relatively settled and calm."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "There wasn't a lot of agitation in it."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "That's really what we're trying to address in meditation, how to find a deep sense of peace that sustains us even in the moments of dying."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Imagine yourself in the, remember what color cushion or chair you're sitting on."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Just kind of start kind of using your imagination to imagine what's actually happening with your eyes closed."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "With something that's, for me, more interesting, but is interesting."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "And hopefully more interesting than the fantasy that was spinning me out."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Then at some point, I know what I'm doing."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Lean over the desk and say, I'm looking for my breath."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Tight feels chest and it's kind of held in as I breathe."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "But so when the mind is quiet enough and a new thought arises, sometimes you see the thought that says that just a thought can pop the bubble and keep us from getting caught up in it."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "And sometimes having a very light nudge like that, using a little word like in-breath, out-breath, can help you stay, stay."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "So just noting what's happening in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "So as the mind gets more and more subtle, sometimes we can use that kind of one word thought to stay here, stay here."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Or if I'm just with a breathing, I might have the thought that this is good."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "For some people, those kinds of thoughts might be so subtle that they don't really feel like thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "And thoughts go away and just get really quiet or seemingly very quiet."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Where does that burden live? It probably lives very much in the thoughts we carry, the thoughts of what gives weight to these big problems we have, how we relate to the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "So the great pleasure, just having thoughts drift by and just realize you're not relating to it, you're not identifying with it."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "We try to process our lives through our thinking, sometimes unsuccessfully."}
{"prompt": "Thinking That Quiets Thinking", "completion": "Maybe your body is not the library that you become, let the mind become quiet for so it can listen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "And it seems to me, in the flow of what we've been doing this summer and the year so far, it would be really great to have these practices and deems brought into our community, our 7 am community, YouTube community."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "See, oh, that's what it is."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "And what a gift to give to others, the gift of not comparing, not making ourselves worse, or better than others, or even the complications of making ourselves equal."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "And we can be present for them in a full way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "We can shake their hands or the equivalent, and really be there and present, and give them some kind of gift of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma, Pt 2 (5 of 5) Being Available", "completion": "So, thank you very much, and I look forward to being back."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "I've always been drawn to body practice in various ways."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "Years and years, it just goes deeper and deeper."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So this is not a small thing that he's saying."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It's just to be present for the breath, to be aware that we're breathing in and out, and just begin to know something about the breath that's coming in and out."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "However, let me start with an even more basic body practice than that, which is that our informal moment-to-moment practice, our daily life practice that's so critical to sustaining the continuity in our lives, that can focus on mindfulness of the body, posture, muscle tension, whether we're tight, and our breathing also."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So this is just the beginning part of it."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "You don't have to think, oh, I'm not doing anything complicated."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So for example, you can feel your hand as you reach for the light switch or notice your spinal alignment as you're sitting in a chair."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And you'll notice the link between letting go of those thoughts and letting go of that tension in the body."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It doesn't mean that every tension in your body is because of something in your mind or vice versa."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "One is to follow the same practice that I described above of noticing where the tension is and relaxing it."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So it's a similar kind of thing, but it's done kind of at a more broad level."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And the same for the mind and other forms."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It starts with the five external body parts."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So if you're not intrigued, don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It's some number of weeks."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "But I learned a lot about the connection between them."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So this is the classical elemental view."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "We might say, yeah, well, we now have the periodic table and we know there's 121 elements or whatever we're up to now."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "But this way of seeing the body is very intuitive."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "The feeling that you have of energy moving in the body."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It's the liquidity of the body."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And then as you get all the way into the ocean, then you're back into liquid and there's nothing being held."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "So it's interesting to see the body this way rather than automatically thinking of it in terms of abstract parts like my knee hurts or I'm cold."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And the mind will kind of go that way and focus in on it."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "Can you do it? It doesn't have to be perfect."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And so I want to talk about that a little bit."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "And it's something that we let in in the way that we can and to the degree that we can as we go along in practice."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "It's a totally safe setting."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "They tend to do regional anatomy."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "Our guide seated it with a seashell."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "I found myself wondering if I could really undertake the tasks of the whole week."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "Many flowers appeared on the offering table."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "The deep fascia and muscle layers brought surprising buoyancy, spontaneous peels of laughter erupted across the room at one point, and our forms took on a sporty, well-toned look."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "In sitting that evening, my mind was a little too quiet as if concealing part of itself."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "Finally, with a simple and profound gratitude, we let the forms go."}
{"prompt": "The Body as a Vehicle of Practice", "completion": "We weren't there when it formed."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Being With the Unfolding Human Experience", "completion": "Body sensations, you touch into them, you might notice there's some fluctuation there."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Being With the Unfolding Human Experience", "completion": "We don't have to try to hold on to any particular thing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "And at times when it seems like the political landscape or the world landscape of the geopolitical landscape is so dire, our minds turn to what is pained for, what is difficult, all the suffering in the world and the people."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "And this past week, we practiced with equanimity, we practiced with equanimity and compassion, we practiced with stability and compassion, just different ways to bring stability to our practice of compassion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "Do not shy away from tasting how delicious it might be to just sit and be breathed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "That there be this inner nourishment with the breath, enjoying what's comfortable, what's beautiful inside."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "So, um, we have a couple of minutes for any reflection."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "Thanks for that request, Michael."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Gratitude for the Ten Thousand Joys Enables Meeting the Ten Thousand Worldly Sorrows", "completion": "It makes me happy every time."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Conflict", "completion": "So here in the United States we're coming up to an election next week, next Tuesday, a week from today."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Conflict", "completion": "And this story points to a couple of things, I think, one is that we do tend to form our views not only based on what we're told on this piece, there's two important pieces here, they are shown a particular part of the elephant, but then they're also told this is an elephant."}
{"prompt": "Navigating Conflict", "completion": "They're kind of set up in a way, this is an elephant, this foot, this tail, this is an elephant."}

{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "And the way my own teacher described the experience of this true nature of mind was very often with three words."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "And this openness has the quality of dissolving the barriers of duality, the barriers of separation, the barrier that makes us feel cut off from everything else so that we are just this one little being here, as opposed to the whole big wide world."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "And in a dream when we know we're dreaming, whatever the quality of what is appearing to us can still be vivid, clear, distinct, but our feeling of being separate from it, of having it be either something that we have to hold on to or push away, that feeling is gone."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "That we're not going to be overwhelmed or destroyed."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "And all these different emotional reactions to things are like the paint of Jackson Pollock, spraying in different parts of the canvas."}

{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "It's about really where is the place for me personally that's tough."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "What's causing the difficulty."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "Now that projection is also something we don't want to ignore because it can be there for quite a valid reason."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "We are able to have more space to be concerned for others."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "And it tends to make my dreams much more interesting because I can relax and sort of follow the storyline without the fear or the urgency that I would feel if I didn't know it was a dream."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "So certainly it's important to take care and to plan and to put attention into those things."}
{"prompt": "The True Nature of Mind", "completion": "This contemplation of death is helpful in the sense that it helps us think of how we want to live our life."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: The Dharma (4 of 5) Onward Leading", "completion": "It's more closer to feeling things or sensing or experiencing the ouch and the ah."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "The relationship between our emotional life and our thinking life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "And sometimes I've noticed, maybe it myself and in people I've talked to, a very strong division between emotions and thinking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "And so we take and regurgitate these stories, ideas, fantasies, all kinds of things and then we chew on it and chew on it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "So there's ways in which I'm a careless person."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "People are telling you that this is bad to be a careless person."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "I'm a careless person and it really speaks badly for 40, 50 years of Buddhist training."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "It might not be so conscious that it's thinking because it might be more of an almost like an attitude, like an emotion."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "Have fantasies and repetition about all the wrongs that have been done."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (1 of 5) Rumination", "completion": "Maybe there's more access to a choice of how to be than if you just let your thinking keep going."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "And also, in Abhidharma, in higher teachings, it's one of the seven universal mind factors that are present in every moment of experience, always concomitant, always together, shows up together with consciousness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "Ah, recognition arises, Sanya."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "Now, it turns out, excuse me, it's interestingly enough, as also you noticed, Vedana is not just impermanent, not just keeps shifting and changing, from one moment to moment, oh, one moment a day."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "Ah, my breath is small, unpleasant, unpleasant, unpleasant, unpleasant, unpleasant, neutral, neutral."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "It's wet, it's unpleasant, I'm cool."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "So, I find this particularly interesting that the asian contemplators made this observation, and it turns out that, actually, when I gave this teaching some time ago, a neuroscientist heard it on a recording and sent me a note saying, yes, actually, this is another example where Buddhist writings, contemplators, really intuited something that we have later found independently in neuroscience and psychology, that the body sensations touch is made up of several receptors, mechanoreceptors, which feel pressure, thermal receptors that feel temperature, proprioceptors for body position, and, finally, nociceptors, which only respond to high intensity, potentially damaging stimuli, and nociceptors are normally inactive until some intense influence acts on it, which will interpret as painful."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "So, fascinatingly, none of the sensors, so whatever arises if the sound arises, even if the sensation arises, unless it's really high intensity, there is no inherent Vedana, it's all impermanent, it's all impermanent, it's all arises and passes away, and it's all dependent on our perception."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "That's not the goal of practice at all."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Feeling Tone (vedana) Is A Changing Perception", "completion": "So thank you all for practicing both for your own sake and the sake of all those whose lives you touch."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Anatomical Parts and Death Contemplation", "completion": "So, you know, the the the bodies aware that this is a body that's composed of parts, that's moving through space, that's conditioned, all of these reflections are kind of encouraged in the in the in the foundation of the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Anatomical Parts and Death Contemplation", "completion": "I was doing this just a little bit in the in the guided meditation, and for me, you know, just, I mean, afterwards, when I was silent, I was just playing with this because I've been reading about it, and so the the words came to my mind, and I think this is this is a kind of a reflective practice that my understanding, so I want to stop for a moment and talk about what reflective practice is, we've talked about that before, but just as a kind of a clarification, let's say."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Anatomical Parts and Death Contemplation", "completion": "Direct awareness practices are opening to just what's here, you know, what's the sensation level of experience, what's the actual experience in the moment."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Anatomical Parts and Death Contemplation", "completion": "So this is, to me, this is bringing in reflection to help us to recognize that this is this is the components of the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Anatomical Parts and Death Contemplation", "completion": "I never choose to do that."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "Maybe ready for liberation."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "In Zen, they talk about big mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "The same word is there in the teachings of the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "Another place where you see this word mind, citta, a tremendous emphasis in the Buddhist teachings in terms of development, is that when the Buddha taught mindfulness practice, part of the instructions for the four foundations of mindfulness, there's a whole foundation called mindfulness of the mind, of citta."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "But their hands are liberated."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "I don't think it works that way."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "He said, when someone becomes totally liberated, there's these certain beings like gods and Mara and devilish characters who can apparently read people's minds."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "But to look for the mind, you won't see it."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "The idea of a location for the mind is a kind of grasping, a clinging."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And so as people practice and get still enough to no longer be preoccupied with their thoughts, preoccupied with their feelings, their body sensations, their emotions, no longer cut up in the objects of what we can be aware of, then we start becoming aware of the quality or the state of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "My mind was a little bit, you know, it could get, it could get, if I got preoccupied by something, it was like zoned in."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "You know, you're so involved, then you're not going to notice the quality of the state of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It takes a certain kind of sense of safety, openness, relaxation, ease, letting go to start noticing the mind."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And there's a whole long list of things that are joyful in Buddhist practice."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And some people don't appreciate because when they look into what's left, there's nothing there."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "But I didn't make the connection."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It was really kind of a dark moment, but it's just complete this shutdown."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "But the luminous mind and liberation is not shut down."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "And Bodhidharma said to him, nothing's holy, nothing's holy."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So that's, you know, if you're pretty, it must have been pretty important for him."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "So the chitta, this mind, one of the things that I think about it, I see it, I think of it as a potential."}
{"prompt": "Liberating the Mind", "completion": "It's just the mind liberated."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "When something is unpleasant we don't like it, we want to push it away, we want to not be associated with it."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "In the Pali it's also called nibbana, or freedom, or sometimes nibbana is translated as enlightenment."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "As soon as greed, as desire or wanting for something springs up, as soon as we want something, there's a feeling of lack."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so he did acknowledge that getting what I want is a kind of happiness, that getting rid of things I don't like, that it is a kind of happiness, that it makes us feel good for a little while, but it's not a very reliable kind of happiness."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "It feels really painful in that way, it feels constricted and tight, and yet there's a way that our heart cannot resist the loss, and then it may just feel like there's this pouring through of the recognition of the loss and the sadness associated with that, but it's open-hearted, it's not tight, it doesn't have the same kind of pain."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There's the first two, which are kind of the beginning, the wisdom, the orientation towards what a different way of understanding our experience and understanding how things happen in our lives, this whole orientation."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And then the next section of the path is about ethical conduct."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so this is that part of the path that begins to address how the greed, the aversion, and delusion might be affecting other people."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There is a recognition when we turn towards it that that is painful."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That's the most obvious level of how greed, aversion, and delusion play out in our relationships in the world."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Reactive emotions such as anger and hatred and impatience and frustration and irritation and greed and confusion and boredom and all kinds of emotions that we feel some stress or suffering about."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And yet in my own relationship to these, this section of the path, it's been very important not to take these as kind of commandments."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There wasn't this encouragement to be curious about any kind of an energy, a greed or an aversion that might be present."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So the exploration here is not about repressing what's happening, not repressing the greed or the aversion, but being curious about it, being mindful of it, bringing that other aspect of the Eightfold Path, the Wise Effort, Wise Mindfulness, and Wise Concentration to bear on our experience if we find ourselves kind of slipping towards harm in our relationships."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "The proposal is there's greed, aversion, delusion at work in our own hearts, and it is worth exploring."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so somewhere in the middle, and actually the Buddha talked about the Eightfold Path as a middle way, in the middle is a place where we explore opening to those energies, neither repressing or expressing."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And it feels at first like it's a narrow middle way, how do we do that? Open to that, those energies, like this is the experience, this is the human experience."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "I might have used this analogy last week too, but it's like when we're following a pattern, it's like we've got our foot on the gas pedal, the gears are engaged, and the pattern is spinning."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Foot on the gas pedal, gears are engaged."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And so when we disengage the gears in the analogy of the car, when we disengage the gears, the car doesn't stop immediately."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And seeing that, we begin to understand much more directly and experientially how this practice is transformative."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And over time it's a slow process, it's a gradual process."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "We start to see them get much weaker."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And the third most subtle and hard to really understand is that we tend to take what is not I, me, or mine to be I, me, or mine."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "But every day, every single day, somebody wakes up in the morning and it is their last day on the planet."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "They go off to work and their normal life, you know, some people actually have the fortune in some ways to become aware of when they are approaching their death."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Some of us will walk out the door and think we're going to have a normal day and project our life into tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "They are, it's just like we are in a river of changing experience."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "That we impute something to be I or me or mine."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "You know, even the river bed is continually being washed downstream."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "There's nothing stable or solid there."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "We are not a thing, an entity."}
{"prompt": "The End of Greed Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Thank you for your attention."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And this is true with respect to any view that we have."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "If we, you know, if we manage to control our environment for a while, we feel like, oh, there's happiness there, you know, it kind of confirms itself, that that's the way to go."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "If we make choices that are skillful, then we tend to move towards happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And when we get that sense for ourselves, then there's an even deeper connection with this wisdom and a deeper motivation to act in the ways that will lead us towards happiness, towards a truer kind of happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So I'd like to talk about these a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "But those on the other side saw that the thoughts of sense desire, ill will and cruelty led to affliction both of himself and others."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So the first, and the first one is kind of a hard one for us to get our minds around sometimes the intention towards renunciation."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Renunciation I think has kind of a bad rap, that word."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And again, this is not something that makes a lot of sense to us."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "That we think that sense pleasure, having our senses gratified, is a path to happiness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "This is not really the approach."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "If we try to through an act of will say I'm not going to want sense pleasure, it's going to lead to repression which is cultivating a kind of aversion and kind of tends to increase that desire because that desire is motivated out of a very strong belief that this is the direction for our happiness and if that belief is not being acknowledged and it's being repressed it's going to kind of come out even stronger."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Now this is not something that happens like, you know, oh, you hear somebody talk about desire and immediately it stops."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So we, you know, as I said earlier, if we get what we want, we have that happiness, but we, you know, we don't really see that it's just reinforcing this wanting, actually."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "The feeling of wanting itself has a kind of unpleasantness, dissatisfactoriness to it."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "It's based in the negative here in the Buddhist teaching."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Anger, hatred, rage, aversion, contempt."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So what's the pathway between these two of either kind of saying yes to the thing or bad thing? Or to recommend mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "This was a two-week retreat, I think."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And then it's just a process of, okay, this is what anger feels like."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "We really kind of have this view or this idea that our anger, in directing anger outward, we have this view that it's going to make the other person miserable."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And there's a practice, a meditative practice that can support this cultivation of kindness."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "My own experience of this, you know, one person I was extremely angry with for several years."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "If I were in Afghanistan, if I'd grown up in Afghanistan, you know, it's hard to say."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "You know, for me, that moment of seeing that opened to, you know, it was kind of humbling."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So that seeing, you know, it showed me the possibility in my own mind of that direction, but also opened me to the compassion."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "And we can also cultivate compassion in a formal way, kind of like the way we cultivate metta."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "So that's the kind of thought that we use to incline our minds towards compassion, bringing someone to mind and recollecting some suffering they may be experiencing and wishing, may you be free from that suffering."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "I'm really stuck with a friend who I'm really angry with."}
{"prompt": "Wise Intention", "completion": "Sometimes anger indicates we do need to take some action, but to be sure that we're being wise about it, that we're not acting out of the anger, but acting out of understanding, acting out of compassion rather than frustration."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Energy", "completion": "Allow your attention to wonder around the body, feeling it, sensing it."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Energy", "completion": "Incline the mind in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Energy", "completion": "It doesn't matter how much energy you're able to bring forth."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "So, today, day five of exploring the refrain of the Satipattana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "And this statement, actually, this last sentence that I was offering just to drop it in, not try to think about it, not try to analyze it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "So instead of leading into frustration of oh, it just doesn't make sense with just dropping the question in living the question with patients, trusting that the practice builds up and it will make sense."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "The refrain is so important that it repeats 13 times in the Satipattana Sutta."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "The next phrase we worked with, mindfulness that there is a body, mindfulness that there is a body is established in one, to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette:  Satipatthana Refrain (5/5) Culminating to Freedom", "completion": "Thank you so much for your kind attention."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And that's a, a source of great, great, great clarity, really, because the mind becomes very, there's a joy that's there."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And, and, but the Buddha doesn't really approach it from that way."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that, that's into that respect for, for training."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "Which is, I thought was, they may not have, I mean, it was done as a play on words."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "When we, when we all live in a place and it's, we perceive it as, as ours."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So that, yeah, in a place like this, in a retreat center and just keeping, and people keeping their eyes open and making sure that SEP fields aren't, aren't, aren't sort of coming into being in different places."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And, but it's, it's, it's really, I think, important to be, be recognizing the, that our practice has to be grounded in a certain ethos."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So it's incredible relief when we recognize, well I was really able to put that down."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And because you reflect on it, there's, there's, there's so many ways that, you know, dhamma can be, you know, we can practice dhamma with confusion, we can practice dhamma with greed, we can practice dhamma out of compulsion, we can practice dhamma out of feeling of duty and, you know, all these different ways we can, we can do it."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "It's not, it's not far away."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "So I think I'll leave it there for today."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And actually even now, I wonder if things Reverend Heng Shui told me is that in China, Buddhism is still registered as a foreign religion."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "But if there's a long dry season, you run out or it gets, it gets broken somehow and you run out of water."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "Do you want to open it up for questions or? Yeah, yeah, I'm happy to come all this way."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "Bante, would you give an example of practicing Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma sort of everyday example that we could know what you mean by that? Well, you know, a lot of things that I even said in terms of, yeah, not letting SEP fields gather around things."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "This is how to act with care for others."}
{"prompt": "First Dharma Talk at IRC", "completion": "And then it becomes this wonderful gift, because the degree of trust and dynamics of human interactions change."}

{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "There's several components to it."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "This is the fuel that drives injustice in this country and hatred in this country everywhere."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And to practice because we want to understand."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "It's more like playing an instrument, right? We're playing our heart strings, our mind strings, and we need to have a sense of attunement and warmth and connection to the effort that we're putting in."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So, you know, covetousness obviously is showing a great desire to have something that belongs to somebody else, right? And grief for the world, you know, is the acute pain that accompanies loss or deep sorrow."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So what he's saying here is just this is quite something to construct, right? It's quite something to get our minds in this space that is holding all of these qualities and is guided by all of this."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "So this practice of raft, it's an acronym, R-A-F-T."}

{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "And so this is the T, the teasing apart, right? And this is Dhamma Vakaya's investigation with composure and intimacy."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "Yeah, and so the questions we might ask ourselves in this space to help elicit some clarity are how am I maintaining a sense of myself in this, constructing a sense of self in this? What are the limitations or what is the suffering in the situation? Is it conditioned, right? And how might it change? And, you know, essentially, I think for me it's very helpful to just kind of remind myself it's not me."}
{"prompt": "RAFT a mindfulness practice", "completion": "I liked your idea about adjusting things with the raft."}

{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And in line, in a lot of ways, with the Dharma teachings."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And so, I don't so much see it as an evolution from doubt to faith, and then no return, but actually a kind of dialectic between doubt and faith."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "They said, you know, two weeks ago, this teacher came through and she said that her doctrines were all true, and everybody else's were garbage, but then one week ago, this other teacher came through and he said that everything she said was wrong and celebrated his own doctrines and disparaged the views of all others, and, you know, one came two weeks ago, one came last week, and we're confused."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Do not believe something just because it's been passed along and retold for many generations or because it's become a traditional practice or because it's known everywhere."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Doubt, this kind of doubt is tolerable in Buddhism, encouraged even, in part because belief is not the refuge."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Maybe now we're seeing that it's a neurobiological transformation, I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "You know, the path, we could say, maybe begins with a kind of doubt."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And maybe we say it's faith that there's another way of living."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "That gets us in the door, that increasingly gets us to stay."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "We may not have even experienced the fruits of practice necessarily, but there's something in us that feels pulled towards practice."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "When that realization does come, and sometimes it happens in a moment, and sometimes it happens just over time."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "But when that comes to some fruition, people, there's a lot of relief."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Because up until that point, we sort of held ourselves to be like the one exception to the Buddha's suggestions."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "But we need to see that for ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "It's got a slightly manicky kind of quality."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "So how do you, in your own mind, put that all together? And I know it's a tough question, but well, it's a question I still grapple with continually."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And for me, what the question it raises is what makes a teaching authentic? Even if the Buddha had a super high quality sound system like IMC 2600 years ago, it was actually recorded as clearly as Andrea's voice on audio Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "So for me, that historical, that gap is not so important."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "The, by far, the most difficult thing I've ever looked at, you know, in my short period here."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And the Dharma is, it's humbling."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Because we are kind of, you know, that which is not seen is not healed."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "So the topic of doubt is really timely."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "You just wish the person success without ever kind of skeptically looking under a rock."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "Because what the mind is trying to do is maybe in this case trying to find a way out of that practice of mudita of sympathetic joy."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And your mind will come up with it will."}
{"prompt": "Wholesome Doubt and Faith", "completion": "And whatever feels wrong or extra, unhelpful, just leave that behind."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "What happens when we practice in this way? So some supports that might help us to practice with this way is to cultivate a sense of well-being, some happiness, and some of that is comfort or ease."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "All of these bring kind of a warmth, a spaciousness, an ease."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "Just simple kindness also brings that sense of goodness inside, and these can be a tremendous support for equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "It's just written, I think, maybe a week ago by Rosemary Traumer."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "I throw in tickets I didn't buy to places I didn't visit."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And so there's so many different ways in which we can calm the reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity and the New Year", "completion": "And of course if we have access to this, we can show up in the world in a different way."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Thinking (1 of 5) Recognizing Thinking", "completion": "And sometimes by kind of like as if someone is asking you, what were you thinking just now? Then sometimes that kind of, I want to say gross, maybe that's not the best word, that kind of very general course, maybe a form of thinking that just simply names what's there to yourself, independent of trying to meditate, develops a skill of learning to, oh, that's what I'm thinking about."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Thinking (1 of 5) Recognizing Thinking", "completion": "And some people's attitude is that we shouldn't be thinking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Thinking (1 of 5) Recognizing Thinking", "completion": "That we don't have to be adversarial with thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Thinking (1 of 5) Recognizing Thinking", "completion": "But anyways, the point being, you can sometimes, as we start getting a handle and seeing what our thinking is about, we also start noticing our attitudes and beliefs about our thinking as well."}

{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "I didn't have any paper at home."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "I think some people really dislike this idea of putting value like that because then sometimes there's a feeling, well, some poor people don't deserve our gifts."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And people would just walk right by them and give to the temple."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And then there's for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And then we go to the third thing today, generosity."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But the tendency is for dana to have a spiritual or religious quality to it."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And maybe that's what generosity means, but it's freely offered."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And that somehow it feeds the good qualities."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And he was going to go to sleep one time in a grove of trees."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But if you give freely and openly, you learn that way, then something inside benefits."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And so there's this wonderful way that attending to the beauty of your own inner life supports greater and greater freedom."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "So finally I'd like to say that this idea of giving is also a practice in Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "So for example, there's all kinds of ways we can practice generosity."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "But you do it as a practice means you do it so you can study yourself and learn what's going on and stretch something and discover how you're challenged by it and see is it really necessary what you're holding on to and you're holding on to more than just, you know, who knows what you're holding on to discover."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "Society is changing so much, maybe, but work better before to carry with you is a significant amount of cash when people weren't so much more of a cash economy, I guess."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "And then you have the practice of looking and studying as you go through your days of someone you can give it to that you don't know."}
{"prompt": "Giviing, Gift, and Geerosity", "completion": "Someone you can give it to that just seems like, okay, this person, I think I'll give it to."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to the Impermanent, Unreliable Nature of Experience", "completion": "Just receiving, allowing, being with."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "It's not just that we experience things in the body, body sensations, and our mind responds to that."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "But even in the commentaries that happened not that long following the Buddhist time, they kind of broke that down into sensation level."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And yet, how is that experienced? We experienced it as kind of pressure perhaps in our throat, maybe vibration or tingling as the air kind of moves into our body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And then the kind of broader sense of the body as we touch into the fuller sense of the body, not just the movement connected with the breath, but just kind of tune into the field of the body."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "We might feel the whole body as a field of vibration, pulsing, tingling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "But you might be able to get a sense of that temperature differential or, you know, maybe touch another part of your body and see."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "But the palm is quite warm."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "That stickiness is water element."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "We could feel the water element."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And she pointed to, he pointed to exploring in the mouth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And so I'm going to guide you through a little exploration of the elements in the mouth."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "How the body speaks to our minds."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "There's a lot of people around, unlikely now in this day and age with social distancing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And just that, that touch there might be experienced as pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "But now imagine you're standing on that same street corner."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And you feel somebody touch you."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "The Buddha talks about these as different processes of body and mind."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And so again, kind of the curiosity about what's the actual physical experience begins to help us to tease apart these different processes going on, and helps us to see where the reactivity actually lies, where the suffering lies."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "But we can, in exploring experiences, like be kind of curious, okay, though there are the physical parts and the mental parts, what is the physical part? We could have that question in our mind, what is the physical part and what is the mental part? And then maybe start to see the sparking, the vibration, the pulsing as separate from the aversion, the imputing of this is going to last a long time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Body: Exploring the Elemental Experience of the Body", "completion": "And when there was this kind of like more curiosity about, well, what's actually here? That curiosity itself can be a tool that helps the mind have a little bit less reactivity, a little bit less judgment to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "Then it's natural to have expectations, wishes, hopes, fears."}

{"prompt": "Collaborating With the Mind", "completion": "So whether something is a thought or a feeling or emotion, whether it's pleasant or painful or neutral, then to have that, to cultivate, to consciously develop the attitude of loving kindness is to recognize, yes, here it is."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So as I read, in this way, in regard to the body, one abides contemplating the body, it doesn't say, you know, one abides."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So observing our own breath, their breath, our posture, their posture, our bodily activities, their body parts, elements, the cemetery contemplation, internally, externally, Vedana, mind states, as well as the aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "The first time I practiced this internal, external, I didn't even know this was part of the teachings years ago when I practiced with my teacher Pahak Sayada, who teaches very, very detailed Vipassana from the Abhidharma and the Visuddhimaga."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "Wow, the impersonality, the impersonality of this body, these body parts."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So when we start Satipatana, as I read, this line starts with contemplating the body internally."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana Refrain (2/5) Internal, External, and Both", "completion": "So the external practice is so important."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "One time the Buddha was doing a Q&A session with some of his monks and one of the monks asked him a question."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "He said, what is the world's great fear? That could be a question that we might ask too."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We have this tremendous fear of doka, yet it is the first of the four noble truths."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And fortunately for us, he also said that these four noble truths were all that we needed to know in order to come to know the end of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And it's unsatisfactory because everything in our world, everything in our existence is conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "What could possibly be satisfying about a constantly moving target? You can't pin anything down."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So let's take a look at the three possible kinds of doka that we might experience in any given moment, because there are three basic kinds."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "For example, let's say the body gets sick."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Maybe we don't have enough, our employee lets us go because we can't work."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So let's look at a couple of very ordinary, worldly examples that might help to explain this kind of doka for us."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So what happens of course as we know, jeez I thought I just cut them, but ten days or whatever later we've got to do it again."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "He might got the message, he thought he'd break it down for us even more and so there are eight or more little points which will really give us a deeper understanding of what docker actually is."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Actually, on the contrary, it's to help us to take the identification out of it all and to help us see it with perspective, just to see it with more clarity of mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "We've spent so much time getting away from it."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So for this kind of mind what we encourage is inclining towards the beautiful, the happy, the lovely, the light, the pretty."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so what also happens is that perhaps for the very first time we begin to feel a resonance with humanity, with all living beings."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "There is this experience of doka and we all want desperately to be happy, but we don't know how to do it."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so really the heart can connect with all living beings just by, through our own practice, opening gently to doka."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So craving is the translation, the English translation that we use for the Pali word tanha."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And directly translated, it actually is thirst that we use the word craving."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "With investigation, as we look more deeply within our own experience by means of the support of mindfulness, we'll come to see that it is the grasping at the wanting that arises in the mind that is causing the suffering for us."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Or there's desire in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And when there is doka, when there is suffering, there will have to be craving there."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So let's take a look at all of the three kinds of cravings that may be there at any given time when there's doka present in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I don't know if you remember several years ago there was, I think it was either on the news or in the newspaper, you know they have these sales at these department stores."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Maybe you've had a little taste of calm for example or just a little bit of ease in the mind and as I said earlier, what do we do? We attach to it and then we suffer when it goes."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It sounds a little more difficult to understand than it actually is."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And the breath hasn't even arisen yet but we're projecting into the future."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I'm going to be the perfect so we're born into being the best or a better whatever it might be."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Craving for future becoming."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That's craving for non-existence."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Or this wrong view of self."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So it's not about judging ourselves and I'm such a greedy person, I'm such an attached person, I'm so ambitious or I'm so anything."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "I'm such an angry person, I've got so much anger."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "What was happening? I was attaching to it, grasping at the arising."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That was where the freedom arose and together with that freedom was the heart of love, this open connected feeling."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "There's no point in holding on to something."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "The Buddha's well-known phrase, all that arises ceases, is so important for us to begin to see in all experiences as they arise."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Cars, it seems I must be a very slow learner."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It definitely has been an improvement, definitely has been a shift."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "Firstly, there is the highest level of the third noble truth."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "And so now there's suffering, the suffering in the mind that we're talking about."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "It can be just a quick moment but we want to notice it because if we miss it we're already grasping at something else."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That is to say now we know how to live in order not to suffer."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "So let's briefly go through what these eight steps are."}
{"prompt": "Four Noble Truths", "completion": "That is the view that more and more knows don't grasp at things because they're changing all the time."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "So, Buddhism, we begin with this basic observation that it's intense to be human, you know? And even when it's going well, it's intense, you know? Just the kind of architecture of our nervous system is such that being human is intense."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "Worrying is a device that I believe can function to do this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "So worrying, restlessness, that the opposite of tranquility, yeah, it's said to be with us very deep into the spiritual path, that sense of looking out for waiting for something to happen."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And sometimes it almost feels like it's the nervous system longing for the Dharma, you know, just like may I be at ease."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And the Buddha says that we were being too simplistic in our causal model."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And I'm not into the three steps to letting go, or, you know, that's just not really how I've."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Worrying and Tranquility", "completion": "And so you are looking at the proud owner of a flip phone, which is so terribly designed."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And the Buddha phrased this by something like, does somebody out there know a way or two out of this suffering? And so we have this question about our lives."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And this doesn't necessarily mean that the entire world is in peace, but that it means our relationship to the world is one of non-contentiousness, is one of maybe kind of being in alignment with what is actually happening as opposed to resistance to what is happening."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And through that openness to what's going on, a path of non-suffering in the Buddhist understanding is kind of a path of skillful engagement rather than aversive resistance or holding on to things that we think will make us happy."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And so it's a broader picture, so some people right now are very happy with the political situations and people are very unhappy with the political situation and so the possibility exists of having a heart that's not in constriction around what's happening out there and in that non-constrictedness can find a way to navigate through the world with an open heart rather than a closed heart and so this is the possibility of freedom and the Buddha said this is possible and yet to step on this path, the very first part of stepping on this path really is this orientation of an understanding and in the Buddhist teachings this is the first factor of the Eightfold Path, the path that describes how we might become free from this constricted heart and the first step is what's called wise view or wise understanding and in this understanding that is at the head of this that helps us to step onto this path is an understanding about what suffering is."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And from that, partly because of the orientation of stepping on the path, because we've gotten instructions that help us to follow the path, then we begin, and it's little by little in my experience, it's a little taste."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "When we do certain things and are motivated by certain kinds of mind states, it will tend to lead us towards suffering."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "What is helpful in terms of if we want to move in the direction of a peaceful heart, of a heart that is not constricted, not in contention, then these are things that will help and these are things that will get in the way."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "What might it be rather than to repress your pain or act out on your pain to hold it and know that it's happening? So being mindful of that, that's one of the aspects of the Eightfold Path."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Because when we are kind of motivated by greed, acting on greed, we are kind of projecting into the future thinking about the thing we're going to get."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Delusion is a little harder to see."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "The capacity of our intentional actions to produce an ethically appropriate result."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And so that's all, everything that we do, except for certain, like, you know, like if somebody hits your knee with the, in just the right spot, you know, that's not an intentional reflex, that's a reflex action, it's not something that your mind is doing because it wants to act, it's just a reflex."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And that reason or that motivation is the key to this law of karma."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "We're more likely to engage in the world with a kindness and a wisdom and a compassion."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "It is said that he had the thought, wow, this is profound and this is subtle."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "He did stop a mass murderer."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "And so this path that he's teaching is not a passive path."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Like right now, I can decide whether or not to pick up this glass."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "I'd engaged in a lot of practicing anger before I met this path."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "One day I got a book, I heard this teaching."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So that was a condition, you know, that was something that came in, like, I didn't make it happen."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "You've stepped into that action, what happens? So we can begin to contemplate the drawbacks of that, begin to recognize the suffering that happens."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "My question is, how do, how can I use mindfulness with the anger, the aversion? I don't know how long, I don't know if anger can have a term in terms of how long has it been, but for me, it's been over a long time."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "I'll say a couple things, but what I'll do too is to point you to, if you're familiar with audio dharma, so we have a, I think you've seen our website, you mentioned that you'd seen our website."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "It's possible right now, I'll just say kind of the place I started, the very first place I started was just to recognize, okay, this is going to be probably a long haul, but that book that I got sent, the very first thing that I did was just in daily life for the first maybe two or three months of my practice."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "Just commit yourself to, and for me it started in a very simple way."}
{"prompt": "Right View: What is Helpful and What is Not?", "completion": "So that's where I'd encourage you to start."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "He was pointing to that while there are things that happen in the world, that we don't like, that may even be unethical or dangerous, that other people do."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And I'm going to phrase this or frame this as things that our minds add to experience that prevent us from seeing things as they are."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "We've learned from our societies and cultures what to believe."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "The Buddha phrased this natural functioning, something along the lines of, whatever one frequently ponders becomes the inclination of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So this is just a kind of very human part of our experience."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "But when we start to play with mindfulness, we start to see these strategies are coming up from inside."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so the mind begins to understand and learn that may not be so helpful."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "The first one that I'll point to is something that's added."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And then further can lead into full-on greed or anger or fear or hatred."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And when I started to see that, the mind was like, wow, look at this."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "That's just going to happen, that's life."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "I need to get rid of things that are unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "The movement of liking and not liking around pleasant and unpleasant often very quickly shifts to something more than that."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "If it's simply liking and not liking, it can be interesting to notice that too."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "That's more of the reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "That's more where there's a little bit of extra turning in the mind that is adding to our experience."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So of course they are coming up."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so sometimes we can find ourselves in a situation where we notice that this wanting has sprung up about something that we don't really need."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And seeing that kind of experience where you actually see the wanting disappear, that gives your mind a learning, kind of gives the mind a learning, a deep learning that the thing isn't what creates the happiness."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And the experience of the wanting going away, there's a kind of a release in that that at times it can feel like, you know, being, if you're really clear, really seeing it very clear as I have seen on some retreats, this kind of the mind just hooked into this wanting and then watching the wanting go away, it feels like being released from prison or being released from a vice grip."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So this process of seeing, being curious about the wanting, being curious about what's added, this goes for whatever is added, it includes all our reactive emotions."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "And so when we're caught in a greed, for example, we can't fathom that wholesome quality of generosity and kindness could also motivate action when we're caught by aversion of reacting to something unethical or something harmful that somebody else is doing."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So the next piece that I want to explore, and then maybe this will be the last piece, there's others I have, but to speak a little bit more about views and beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "So there's what we could call our own personal views and beliefs that are based on our own personal conditioning, the own way that we've been shaped by our experience because of our own body and the way our minds work."}
{"prompt": "Seeing Things as They Are vs Seeing Things As We Are", "completion": "But because there's so many people that we've shared this belief system with, it's a little bit harder to kind of hold it lightly."}

{"prompt": "Othering: Me and Them", "completion": "But often it's, it's just because they have a particular body type or a particular skin color, or they're dressed a particular way or something that we then have a whole set of associations that go along with that."}

{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "It literally has too much to think."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "Well, one of the ways I personally would extend it, actually, is, and this is not traditional at all, but is, I think, really quite important, is beginning to extend that sense of gratitude for your own joys, your own good fortune as well."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "It's the play of joy and sorrow."}

{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "Now, in the way that we use this as much more of an insight practice, it's not about the repetitions."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "May I be safe and protected? May I be at peace? May I live in this world with kindness and with ease? Now, you could say that over again and again and again, and that would then be concentration."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "You've got to listen in some senses for the rebound, the echo."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "That is where your insight is."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "It really misses out on the power to actually touch that heart-mind."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "Which is even why we have to incorporate the gentleness, the kindness into the practice itself."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "A good practice actually incorporates, whatever you're doing, incorporates all."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "But you also have to have the metta in order to be able to treat the mind respectfully."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "What would your prescription be for, should we just try metta for extended period of time, weeks at a time, and see what happens? Yeah, I would."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "It's not said that you're skipping from one to the other in the same kind of time span, but that you actually do that for that period."}

{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "It is a good way of helping with doubt as well because, you know, this word doubt which I think I wrote up on the board the other day."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "Doubt itself is going to undermine everything you do."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "I was given method practice by a teacher because I was in a long retreat and a lot of aversion, hatred and ill will came up."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "Yeah, so it becomes a little bit I don't know, more method in the worst possible sense because you're just using the phrases again and again and again and again and again to kind of hone it down in a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Metta as a Path to Awakening (part 2)", "completion": "We're not pushing it away Yes you befriend whatever is arising so when my mind in the initial stage let's face it most of us find meta quite difficult particularly for ourselves in the initial stages and as I said you might use the phrases and actually when I use the phrases may I be safe and protected may I be at peace may I live with friendliness and ease in this world you might not feel that at all because of our backgrounds often our conditioning there are often great obstacles and blockages to that and say actually I'm not worthy of that in fact this is self-indulgence I've heard so many people say that to extend these phrases towards myself in that way is just mere self-indulgence that's Protestant culture actually most of it and I say that because I think that's what's going on in Britain it's Protestant culture we get this stuff that we should be concentrating on others not on ourselves or focusing on others so we might not get that so we get this feeling of unworthiness perhaps that arises in relationship unworthiness itself becomes then the source of being able to befriend that unworthiness so you're generating a meta within the insights that you're actually allowing to arise about how you actually feel at this moment now obviously because it's the mind this is a changing relationship it will change over periods of time if you allow yourself the opportunity and you allow yourself the opportunity to keep on befriending what comes up the chances of the genuine meta arising is actually open for you within this and so it becomes a softening process so what is hard is met with softness it's very it's almost like the Taoist image isn't it of that which thinks itself hard is worn down by the soft water erodes stone and it's the same with meta erodes you know or the befriending process will erode whatever hard you know hard judgments that we make on ourselves does that kind of answer your any one more than perhaps well just one more and then I'll go on towards the conclusion hold on you need a you mentioned that cultivate the soil of friendliness and could you elaborate more and it's a metaphor you know it's a feel, multivator feel but what do you mean exactly you know actually in practical terms I think I've just been explaining that in actual practical terms what you're cultivating is the field of your being how you are at this moment in time everything that arises in relationship to doing the practice becomes if you like the soil for cultivation you're reworking it over you're taking out the stones you're taking out the boulders I know I'm using more metaphors here but that's what we're doing every time something hard arises to the surface somebody plowing the field sometimes hard rises to the surface you remove it we don't remove it forcibly here we allow it to remove itself interestingly enough by having been seen by having been acknowledged so in practice let me really come down to the actual practice again just to remind everybody before I kind of draw everything to a conclusion is that what we're doing is listening to what is arising we're using the phrases as instances of or opportunities to listen rather than talk the mind is chattering all the time isn't it we're talking all the time so we're allowing ourselves by using these phrases as a way of listening to something listening to the resonances that arise from that practice now that is cultivation that is the cultivation of the soil whatever is arising itself whether that be hard or whether it be soft whether it be a kind of pleasant thought or an unpleasant thought a feeling of unworthiness or a feeling of joyfulness that itself becomes befriended with the mind which is receptive and open and gentle towards it when we continue to do that it's like really continuing to plow our field again and again and again and again and as was indicated earlier on by one of the other questions after a while then things like compassion on that are not things you do they're what arise naturally it's almost as if the field now has enough nutriment in it to enable the flower of compassion to arise naturally out of it so the practicality is to keep doing it again and again and again but not obsessively compulsively doing it again and again and again but to do it in this slowing down way in slowness I'm getting off into a rant here aren't I but I was going to say we live our lives incredible speed these days and it's getting faster a lot of it and actually what these practices metapractice and all the practices particularly metapractice is about beginning to slow to slow down to slow down is to treat respectfully to slow down is to pay attention to slow down is to actually see to hear to look to listen and this is what we're doing we're beginning to slow down and allowing ourselves the opportunity for those qualities which are covered over by business to naturally arise I see it's kind of when I do vipassana meditation or staying with breath and I can see we can practice implicitly the metta in the sense that any sort of rising we treat it accept it nicely gently yes exactly but without really actually verbalizing the metta phrases that's the implicit use of metta that's why I say that no practice which is being done in the sense properly excludes metta it has to include metta because it's the gentle way in which we treat the mind now this is not self indulgence it's not a cop out it's also just that ability to hold whatever arises gently but also to return the mind gently back to the object or focus which is generally the breath in these cases in the implicit sense I can understand metta gotta be part of any practice but you are saying that it's beneficial to set aside certain time of the day or year so to explicitly focus explicitly do it and then you'll find that the implicit is easier to do as well so you've got to bear in mind that none of these practices are mutually exclusive none of them are mutually exclusive they actually all benefit each other so if you're doing metta practice that's certainly going to benefit the personal practice that's going to help you in your ability to attend to what's going on in your metta practice and they're both going to help an aid concentration practice and concentration practice isn't going to aid both of those so please don't see these as being all kind of well I do one thing and I'm of a personal practice which I hear so much of perhaps I ought to move on to the finish again it's a who done it it was me honestly okay let me just kind of make some final remarks here about this I want to say something a little bit more about karuna here about compassion within it the way that the Buddha sees it the way it's portrayed in much of the text and particularly within the brahma vahara practice karuna is the impulse towards tenderness and concern I really emphasise those words tenderness and concern actually compassion cares that's another way of putting it compassion cares actually mindfulness cares too mindfulness cares about what it's doing that's why these practices are other dimensions of mindfulness they're not excluded from it they're not sort of something else that we're doing here that's not no it's not samasati these are all samasati these are all right mindfulness so it has concern it's basically it's concerned to alleviate the pain of others now shantideva describes this and I think he describes it beautifully in the bodhichara avatar which is a mahayana text it's not in the early text but I think he really picks up on something it's very very important it's concerned to alleviate pain just as instinctively as the hand reaches out to pluck out a thorn that is embedded in the foot in your own foot it reaches out in just the same way instinctively to do that to engage with the other as well so it's you see the other's pain and you reach out now that might be reaching out with the mind because obviously we can't be present with everybody's suffering in the way that there is this endless sea of dukkha out there but it's that tendency of the mind to wish to to wish to move out towards others and actually more often or not we can find ways of helping in many ways now in order for that to happen and I haven't used this phrase but I think it's been implicit that metta is the melting of the heart it's the melting of the heart that allows that to happen and so karuna rather than actually I've spoken about them almost as being two separate things so far I've spoken about metta obviously it's been the main concentration of what I've been speaking about over this morning and I've spoken a little bit about karuna and it almost sounds like they're two separate things doesn't it? actually they're not let's overcome this mythology that metta and karuna are two separate things metta is the melting of the heart karuna is metta in action that's all it is it's just metta in action so first the development of this boundless friendliness this expansive friendliness which melts the heart towards ourselves and towards others and then it becomes karuna as action hence the root here to act to turn to see others to move away now the disciple who's perfected in this is actually described in the Pali Canon it's very interesting this phrase which is called sabaloka anukampi a person who pulsates with compassion for the well-being of the world sabaloka anukampi a person who pulsates with compassion for the world and that's what we can become this is our possibility this is our possibility of being now I think this is for me one of the main things about the brahma vaharas seen in this way is they're not kind of adjunct practices but they're possibilities of our human flourishing in this world and if anything that I think that the early texts are about and getting away from any mystical aspect at all I personally would want to write it out and I know that offends a lot of people any mystical dimension to this at all the Buddha's concern is about human flourishing how you can best be in this world with others nibbana is not a mystical experience nibbana is the absence of greed, aversion and delusion and the greatest human flourishing comes about through the absence of greed, aversion and delusion and the movement into upeka which is the finality actually of the brahma vaharas the outcome of all the work with metta so it's the natural flourishing we start to do this work and we naturally begin to find ways of being that hitherto haven't been accessible to us are inaccessible for all sorts of reasons hindrances, fetters, blockages all of these things which are stopping us from flourishing in this world so the Buddha's path is a path of human flourishing it's not a path of something superhuman I think this is for me why the figure of the Buddha is so powerful it's the figure of the Buddha both within the text and that is a powerful figure because he represents the epitome of human flourishing what is to be in this world there's an image which is used in a very late text actually which is the avatamsaka the avatamsaka sutta which is a pure land sutta and I don't actually like it very much the avatamsaka sutta because it's kind of all it's a very baggy monster of a text and it's all over the place but it has a wonderful image it says the Buddha walks through the world with bliss bestowing hands I think it's a lovely image now without getting kind of sentimental about it in a way if you think if you think your way into what that actually means it means you go through the world not leaving a wake of destruction behind you a wake of detritus and misery but you move through the world actually fulfilling human potential which is actually here to develop dimensions of real understanding and real engagement with ourselves and others and the world itself and I think that's what's so important about this just a few words about the other two brothers of ours it's kind of almost a whole day on themselves but just a few words about them the first muddita let's get away from the idea of sympathetic or empathetic joy the actual word muddita actually has its roots in to be gentle it's gentle joy it's probably the most accurate translation of this although you don't get that it's a gentle joy I don't think it's any real equivalent to it in any English language it has connotations emotional resonances of within the Pali of soft-heartedness gentleness, tenderness being suffused with joy and gladness of the heart it doesn't sound like too bad a state to be in does it so these are what are all implied so muddita rooted in compassion is both concern and joy that's an interesting mixture isn't it to be concerned about others and about yourself and yet to be joyful as well now I think joy doesn't get much of a look in in most Buddhist practice it's often that bit that's written out I'd like to kind of put in a plea for joy I'd like to kind of put in a plea for joy in terms of the practice it can all become a bit too pious and one of the great benefits of my early training was I spent years and years and years with Tibetans and if there's anything I learnt from Tibetans it was actually this practice was great fun you know it wasn't just misery it was great fun and you know it was a wonderful joyful thing to be engaged in as well as difficult and as well as hard and all the other things they emphasize as well but it was this joyfulness it was the heart of the practice and I think we forget that at our own peril really that's when your doubts start to creep in that's when you lose a sense of confidence if there's nothing joyful happening you need to look at your practice again you need to refresh it now I'm saying this in the context of the Ramavaharas which is slightly different but we also need I think as I mentioned earlier on also to appreciate what joyful aspects there are in our lives to regularly celebrate them as well as celebrating the joys that the others have perhaps which are not in your life so it's celebratory this joy there is so much good that is going on out there as well as the bad and we again forget that at our peril there's an awful lot of good stuff going on there's an awful lot of goodness as Walt Whitman once said he said I didn't know I had so much goodness in me it's in his very very famous poem so we need to celebrate that from time to time to come back to the goodness which is there the goodness in the world and the goodness which is within ourselves not burying our heads in the sand and not realizing all of the the dukkhas out there all the pain, all the suffering as well so it's both concern and bliss concern and joyfulness and there's again phrases which are associated with these which help us to rejoice in the joy of others but I would add that little plea as well rejoice in your own dimensions of goodness too as well as the difficulties that you have now finally of course there is upeka and those who've been with me for the last couple of days also know that I feel that upeka is also the pinnacle of the practice upeka is also the goal of this practice to come into a feeling of equanimity the greatest happiness as the Buddha says a number of times in the Pali Canon is nothing other than contentment this is the greatest happiness so it's the lack of the drivenness it's the lack of the drivenness of craving of tanha when tanha is absent the craving to avoid and the craving to have then there is upeka when that craving is diminished on its process of being diminished or when it's finally gone that is what we discover we discover poise, balance and engagement and I gave everybody, I'll say this to the people who weren't here the other day there's a synonym in the Abhidharma for upeka which is tatramajatata in Pali this means in the middleness now I think this can be interpreted in a number of ways it's literally in the middle like not being thrown off balance of something not being swayed by either the good things that happen to you not being buffeted by the worldly winds which will constantly buffet us praise and blame and all this sort of stuff that are constantly buffeting us so we go out looking for one and we get the other we don't like what we get but we wanted the other one and so on and so forth we're not swayed in other directions so we literally are poised and balanced in that way but I also think it means a lot of life so equanimity is not something we do on a mountain top or in a hermit's cave or in a monastery equanimity is there to be seen and engaged in an ordinary average everyday existence our ordinary average everyday activities this is where we need to develop it if we don't have it and I think often what we see in our societies is our societies don't have this what we get is unbalanced and dislocated societies with unbalanced dislocated people within our societies this is what it's about now it's about focus as well and having equanimity also implies aspects of discipline something which is very unpalatable I think often in the western world these days is actually beginning to build a discipline as one teacher of mine said to me once he said if you want freedom the only freedom you're going to get is within discipline freedom isn't the freedom to do anything the freedom that you have is the freedom within a particular discipline and there you would develop equanimity but this is not rigid discipline this is not a brutalization again of yourself this is a discipline such as a rule of training that almost takes me almost right back to the beginning when I started the other day rules of training this is what precepts are they're rules of training ethicality being grounded in ethical inquiry through our rules of training this is the discipline here I think I've finished thank you well that's not to sort of stop any questions if there's any final questions I'd be very happy to answer for a few minutes or so but I just want to thank everybody for listening for such a long period of time to me thank you."}

{"prompt": "Feeling Tone is Conditioned", "completion": "And this instruction, this kind of curiosity about experience from this perspective of the pleasant, unpleasant neutral aspect is something that Buddha talked about a lot."}
{"prompt": "Feeling Tone is Conditioned", "completion": "That's the first part of the instructions on this foundation this establishment of mindfulness of feeling So it encourages us to just recognize."}
{"prompt": "Feeling Tone is Conditioned", "completion": "I mean often we might think just to start just to start the the teachings point to how feeling tone is conditioned based on Kind of contact with our senses If we're not having if there's not a contact with the senses, so if our eyes are closed We may be seeing like like the colors and shapes behind the eye, but we're not seeing the objects in the room And so we're not having sight impinge on the eye So there's there's not the pleasant unpleasant neutral happening with respect to the seeing So so the pleasant unpleasant neutral is conditioned based on that contact based on the contact of of You know with our body with our eyes, you know the there's the eye there's sight and then there's these the contact there And there's a teaching that says the meeting of the three is contact and with contact one feels With contact is a conditioned feeling happens And so the the feeling arises Independence on contact."}
{"prompt": "Feeling Tone is Conditioned", "completion": "We all have met these teachings of the buddha where he points to there's actually a deeper kind of happiness More sense of well-being that comes When we are not trying to Get what we want get rid of what we don't want in fact He says that that movement towards getting and getting rid of if we look at that if we look at that right there Look at that experience of leaning towards or pushing away from We don't usually look at that because we are so focused on the getting or the getting rid of And so focused on the future possibility that I'll be with that thing or without that thing that we are not touching into the experience of the wanting or the resistance itself The wanting and the resistance Are both unpleasant They both have an unpleasant quality when we actually start to look at them And so this this is also a way in which this cycle is reinforced because When we get something that we well, let's let's talk about getting rid of something we don't like."}

{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "Last week, I kind of explored mindfulness as part of the eight-fold path, as a piece of our whole journey and as kind of a tool, a key tool for helping us to find our way towards ease and peace in our lives to a release from dukkha, a release from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And what we are constructing, what we are experiencing is not only what's out there."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "So that teaching really, that description of this is how to attend to your experience."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "So attending to the body as a body, we explore, well, there's the physical sensations."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "We start to see ideas and views connected with that."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "All of those things too, those experiences fall into some of the other areas."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And a not liking of that unpleasantness."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "Well, we attended the body as a body and that highlights, oh, there's feelings here."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "Can there be the recognition of unpleasant as unpleasant? Oh, that's unpleasantness happening."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "We're asked to kind of see all of those as natural arising, not as me, not as who I am, not as mine, but as this is a human experience arising based on conditions."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "Even that is a construction in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And what we tend to do with that process is to give it, like attribute something to it that it is not."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "We attribute a permanence to it."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "There's body, there's the sensation of tension in the body, there's the unpleasant feeling."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "This, this, this exploration, the, the first noble truth talks about dukkha suffering should be understood."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And that, that again, that is, that is what's arising here and that is what we're asked to know."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And there is with the ability to kind of hold it with this perspective, oh, there's irritation."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "So it may sound like, you know, knowing irritation as irritation feels just like clinical."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "And that this is a human condition."}
{"prompt": "Perspective of Right Mindfulness", "completion": "The place I can act is to see if I can transform this internally to change my relationship to this internally."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Before I start picking up on dependent origination, which is where we finished off yesterday, and I'll do a little bit of recapping, certainly for anybody who's new to today."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So I'm going to start off with a couple of quotations."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Dependent origination, the Buddha's most profound teaching, I think."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "In many ways, even things like the Tibetan obsession with emptiness is nothing other than an extrapolation of some aspects which are already there within the notion of dependent origination as we find it in these early Pali Nikayas."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "There is no, if you like, first cause which isn't caused by something else."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "This ceases to happen, this ceases to happen."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Something else which I didn't say yesterday, and I also want to say today, the model that I'm working with here on dependent origination is very much of 12 links all occurring in one moment."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And I mean that on a very fundamental existential level."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "There is nothing that is remaining the same."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So what the Buddha is really in very much in particular in the early text is suggesting that this has to come from within."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "In other words we learn not to get into this reactive patterning of simply pushing away what we don't like and trying to grasp hold of what we like and stabilize it and make it certain."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "When I lived in Tibetan society there was used to be saying this in Tibetan society."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "It could actually change your life."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Craving and grasping and holding on in a particular way."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Confusion, trying to make sense of the world."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So in many ways a lot of our practice is about beginning to discern, and this is not always easy, what our intentions are."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So we're uncovering our intentions behind our actions."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "I'll put the Sanskrit first, because this is the word that we normally use."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Well, I say it's the most misinterpreted word."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And that's passed into our language too, hasn't it? It's very much passed into it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Some of them, for example, do not catch up with us until many, many, many years later."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "But the intentions are generated in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "It's not the totality of it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Strive on diligently is the actual more light way of putting it, but it's really how do you live with that understanding? Now, normally in our ordinary average everyday lives, we don't live with that understanding, because we're trying to avoid those facets of things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "We actually don't want to know."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "It's kind of a subsidiary practice."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "It means to grow fat with friendliness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Sorry, long answers, short question again."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Because that's not what it's about."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "In Eastern traditions, for example, when I was doing metapractice in Sri Lanka, metapractice for yourself was actually fairly small, because most Sri Lankans don't actually have a problem with themselves."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "I mean the amount of Tibetans are always telling me how good they were at things."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And you tend to attach yourself to this understanding that you are this particular type of person."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Don't you feel hurt? Yeah? If somebody challenges you something, somebody says to you, you've got this rather irritating habit, you know, of doing this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "You spent the whole of your lifetime building up habits."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "These are patterns that we identify with and we identify them because they're telling stories that we've inhabited for long times."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "It's not as if you can say, well, this is occurring, then this is occurring, then this is occurring."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Yeah, as far as I remember, there's only one citation of that in the whole of the canon."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Something that's been inserted in the canon."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Yet, and I will say this, many traditions, particularly later than the early texts, will go down exactly that route."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "I had a conversation with another Pali scholar a long time ago about the origins of that word, Winyana."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Are you saying the we is the consciousness part or the."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "That's really what it's saying."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Well, as we know, I had thought about trying to get a photo copy for you, but there is, I mean I divided a little thing and showing you how the Buddhist schools Well, it may help you if I tell you why I'm asking you because it used to be believed until about 50 years ago that early Christianity had fairly uniform ideas when it was a small movement."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "You get a schism occurring."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So basically it was very pragmatic about can I live with you if you've got a different set of rules to me? For example one group might say well we're not going to eat after lunch and the other group will say hey I want an evening meal."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And the Astiravada which is the precursor of what becomes the Terravada in Sri Lanka."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Now the Astiravada are a bit po-faced and wanted to really really hold to minute points of doctrine."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "He's talking about something I think far more fundamental and not associated simply with Jhana states."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "This gets much more detailed in terms of Abhidharma."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So it's actually quite a complex picture that's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "I think from our point of view, I don't usually like Buddha ghosts, but I actually like this particular phrase of him."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "You know, and eventually it gets the point that it can't run away and it settles down."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "But in the early stages what you're finding is it's not really under your control."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "Sanya being, you remember when I did the aggregates with you yesterday, Sanya being the discriminative perceptive aggregate that's there."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So, if you think of Nama-Rupa as being the way in your present that you're actually determining if you like your future."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And I'd say that actually with a slight tongue in cheek because, again, he hasn't got the philosophical background of India there because within early Indian thought the sense of the real person was the Nama, was the name of somebody."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So much so that by the time you get to the formation of something like the Theravada schools we know it, they've actually lost, not the plot here, but they've actually lost the context in which the Buddha was talking about this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "So there's a no sense consciousness, an eye sense consciousness, an ear sense consciousness, a body sense consciousness, and a mind sense consciousness too."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 5", "completion": "And then after this it all starts to get a lot more interesting."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Happiness From Senior Sangha July Meeting", "completion": "What I'd like to try to do is to connect this desire to be happy with love."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation on Happiness From Senior Sangha July Meeting", "completion": "You can open your eyes now."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So tonight, I'd like to talk a little bit about equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "I don't know how many syllables it has, but it's one of those words that just doesn't feel like a word that's, you know, in our usual vocabulary and it feels like very kind of technical."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "In the sense of we can ask ourselves, as a human being and as a practitioner, do I know both ends of this spectrum, that is the richness, the fullness of being alive and having an emotional life, as well as the richness and fullness of equanimity, when we're not filled with emotion in such a way that it's affecting us in a way that we're maybe a little bit off-balance."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And sometimes we're a little bit off-balance as practitioners, the key word here maybe is practice."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But this path of practice is not only about having a pleasant life, it's not only about making our life more comfortable, though it certainly does that."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Instead, there's other practices that can be a support for just the natural arising of equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "We need both of these, wisdom and well-being, to help create the conditions in which equanimity might arise."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "In the same way that if you maybe don't know how to swim and you get thrown into the water, if you don't know how to swim, you're going to thrash about more than you need to."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But if you get thrown in the water and you have a life jacket on, you just pop up to the top, and then maybe you just need to not thrash around as much, you can swim and find some safety."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So maybe in the same way, having a sense of well-being is really a support for equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "If we're having some difficulties, it might be nice to have some neutral experiences."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And to have this experience over and over again during meditation, of having survived yet one more meditation period, even though we might be feeling terribly irritated or restless or falling asleep or whatever it might be, whatever hindrance might be active for you."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So some other practices are a number of reflection practices including how things change, as well as some cultivating some well-being such as generosity, just noticing that the sense of well-being that arises when we cultivate that."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So equanimity, this word that has too many syllables but is actually a beautiful, warm, connected experience that can be a tremendous support for our lives and for our practice so that we can be a support for others."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So, I'm just trying to land in this space and do what I came here to do."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "I came here to talk tonight about desire and all the things that I heard about it, and thought about it and read about it."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "Even we come from desire, right? Our parents' desire to merge."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It can be helpful or not so helpful."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So, I want to talk about how do we distinguish these desires? You know, it can be the catalyst for a meaningful life or the tornado that rips through it."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "In other words, there's always this gap, an obstacle, the space between me and what I want."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "And I suggest that if we want to relate to desire in a different way, we got to learn to sit in that gap."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "That desire opens up between me and what I want."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "And I think to disregard it or, you know, without discernment, it's to throw the baby out with the bathwater."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "You're not supposed to swear here."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's about really this discernment I keep pointing toward between what's helpful and what's not."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "I knew I was wrong when I did this thing that got me in the fight with my wife tonight."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's really bizarre to see it so black and white."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "But there's a different quality to the idea that we're all just longing for connection."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "When we can be with that as the root of our desire, it takes a lot of smoke and mirrors away from me."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's asking you investigators, sit in it, Jack."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "And instead of reacting to it or denying it."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's like, no, man, hunger arises."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So why don't we feel like that, though, right? How do we delve into the experience of desire? See, every desire tells us that things in the present are limited and lacking."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "And you either accept the desire or accept the lack."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "It's foreign to the mind, but our hearts know better."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "These are some of my thoughts and a lot of my teacher's words and some stuff I read."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "And the best thing I can offer is company."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "I think I have trouble telling the difference, but they both stand between you and it."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So I was sitting with some resentment in my marriage and realizing that the resentment was around the way things haven't been."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "So what I'm asking is when you find yourself in a state where you want something to be different, right? How much of your meditation is in that space? You just sat for 45 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "Because there might be a sensation connected to it that's actually trying to keep you present."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "Wealth, driving an SUV, having a 10 bedroom house, being a Hollywood star."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "May all beings know peace."}
{"prompt": "Desire", "completion": "May we all work towards liberation."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And the desire is often shaping the experience we have when we stop and just be because there's so much momentum in our desires, in the desiring mind that you stop and you feel the tension of that sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And we're hardly aware of it."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "There is a little bigger desires like, you know, needs go to the bathroom or desire to eat if you're hungry or a variety of things."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And the other goes in the direction of aspiration."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And it's very important to make this distinction."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "I was clinging to something."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And some people are so concerned about security or all kinds of things, that it's unimaginable not to cling to these things because it's just too frightening or too disorienting not to have these things."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "It's not so distant and lost in discursive thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "I'm wonderful and I have good taste in cars."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And I notice after a while that I leave the bookstores exhausted."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Another consequence of craving is a kind of alienation on oneself and others."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "You can see them through the filter of how they support or help our craving."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And then for another cost that's kind of connected to all this, is it keeps us, craving keeps us on the surface of life."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "We're constantly involved in craving and wanting."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "We're not really connected to something deep inside."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And since I'm giving a talk right now, I'll use an example from my."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And I notice that I can be kind of, up until that point, I can be kind of more or less centered in myself, down my belly, and kind of relaxed."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And then when the clinging or desire, that kind of desire comes up, I feel myself tensing a little bit, up into my belly, up into my stomach, and the energy of my kind of system goes up, and up and kind of forward, and my center of gravity goes forward a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "My God, what was that about? It can be like, oh no, what have I done? You know, I just put my kids' college fund all into the California lottery."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And so they measure people's happiness, and so they went and measured, I guess, the happiness of people who won a lottery, a year after they won a lottery, and they discovered their happiness quotient, as they average, the amount of happiness they had, was the same as someone a year after they become quadriplegic."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And so some people get off into fantasy and it can be very pleasant fantasy and they really enjoy it for a while."}

{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Boy, I didn't know idea they were going on all the time."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "If it's so costly, maybe it's helpful just let it go."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "Sometimes when it's hard to let go, a useful strategy is to ignore it."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So what does it feel like? What does it feel like in the mind? What does it feel like in the heart? What does it feel like in the body? What's the felt sense? And then to feel it."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "There's a lot of benefits to feel spaciously, openly what's going on here."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And so if you just kind of let go of the craving too easily, you might not ever actually have a chance to see the loneliness."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So to really feel, and it takes time, it takes generosity of spirit to just kind of, okay, there's my craving, and this is my chance to get to know it and really feel it and give it, you know, it's not pleasant, I wish it wasn't there, but it's here, so I'm going to just give it all the time it needs so I can really feel it."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "And then the lawyers come in to play afterwards to justify, not, you know, give reasons afterwards."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "So, so writing out a desire, so you might feel, and sometimes with addiction, it gets really strong, it gets tremendously compelling, and you just get committed to sit still, don't act on it, sit in your chair, don't get up."}
{"prompt": "Desire and Craving", "completion": "When sometimes in the heat of the addiction, it seems like you're going to die if you don't get it."}

{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "Jan, did you have something? Yeah, this may be another silly question."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So when like the, the, the full freedom is the uprooting of the latent tendency towards or the underlying tendency towards greater version of delusion."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "And if the, those practices are done from the perspective or with the wisdom or the aim towards, like even the jhana practice, if it's done with the, in the service of understanding greater version of delusion, understanding how craving leads to suffering, there's a development in the direction of that."}
{"prompt": "The Eightfold Path and the Ending of Greed, Aversion and Delusion", "completion": "So, I, I, It kind of comes back to intention."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And I'll get into that in a little bit more in just a bit."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's not true for everybody."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It is a transition point where we begin to, to touch into something that is actually happening in the mind, this, this, this experience of pleasant unpleasant neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "What tends to happen with the experience, particularly of pleasant and unpleasant neutral often we don't particularly notice, you know, neutral we can kind of space out around."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "We can know something is unpleasant and have no sense of not liking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So the the response when there is awareness of pleasant unpleasant neutral experience can come from wisdom rather than the habitual reaction."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And then the guided meditation I suggested, you know, that you might notice if there's a pleasant or unpleasant experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It doesn't necessarily stop the not liking but again the mindfulness, the mindfulness helps the mind to begin to recognize actually what the mind begins to recognize there is when there's the unpleasant experience and the not liking."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's just a little bit unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And, and maybe we can start to see that, that the just being with that unpleasantness is a very different experience than having that unpleasantness course with the corresponding reactivity to it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Both those people and people who are untrained will experience pleasant and unpleasant and neutral."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And yet somebody who doesn't have the training in mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "He says they worry and grieve they lament beat their breast weeping and distraught."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So that's that that you know the unpleasantness of the sensation and then the unpleasantness of the reaction."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And it's just like the conditions of the world."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Mindfulness and wisdom begin to kind of recognize oh that doesn't have to be the way it is and it begins to slowly recondition towards just knowing oh that's a painful feeling."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It's probably the easiest place to begin to see the feeling tone."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "We might we might begin to notice that that you know the similar kind of sensation might be kind of interpreted as pleasant in one situation or unpleasant in another situation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "There were two scenarios that participants were exposed to one where there were they either had a moderately painful sensation or no no painful sensation that you know that either no sensation so they were they were told okay you're going to get this moderately painful sensation or the you know it's not going to happen and you know how did they rate that moderately painful sensation and what happened in their brains yes it interpreted as pain."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "The researchers were a little surprised by this result actually."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "Okay this is not going to be so unpleasant this time."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "And so I had thought that that scratching sound was was from a dear friend who'd come, you know, come back after a long, you know, scratching I'm home, you know, maybe I would have had a different interpretation but no my mind thought it was a rat so you know it created that that experience of unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "This happens all the time, actually, that what we are experiencing is pleasant unpleasant neutral is shaped by views by beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "You know, we often will will notice the reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "In the case of the, you know, the scratching sound."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "So there there's the, there's pleasant unpleasant neutral experience."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "There was a kind of a pleasantness within that just just just really felt that it's kind of like a kindness kindness to myself just just to kind of say oh yes that does feel just a little bit uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "We learned that the, the feeling tones associated with the path of practice are, you know, they're kind of like a sign or a guide post to us."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "This is this direction is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "It also seems like some of the other thing I was thinking about with thoughts is that a thought can happen and it's pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "I love to look at with thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness of Feeling Tone", "completion": "You know, it's just vibration of the eardrum, and it's the interpretation of what the sound is."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And of those four, the foremost is the light of wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "To get a sense of what this might mean, a few analogies might be useful."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "But as soon as someone turned on the light, there was this relaxation that happened."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "I said, oh, wow, now it's like effortless to bike on a flat piece of ground."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "So this is the greatest light to have, the light of the mind, the light of awareness that can be turned on."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "They had no idea how the self-talk and the attachments and the clinging and the aversion and even the hostility that self-criticism can live in here, how strong it can be."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "To learn to relax the mind and to trust just being present without preoccupation, without trying to fix anything, get away from anything, destroy anything, but just to really see and to see and to use the ability to be mindful, ability of attention, to really see clearly enough, really clearly in the clarity we find the freedom."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Not the freedom that requires something to go away, but the freedom from not being fixated on it."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "It's a kind of a tightening or a resistance or a narrowing or a darkening."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And so then as we do that, there's this light that is discovered."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "And this is where I think the path of freedom, the mindfulness that, when the mindfulness is discovered some degree of freedom, this is when the practice gets really rich and more challenging."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "I kind of like to think of it as, meet so they fit like a glove and a hand."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Try to look at the challenges in all directions."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Just like the Buddha said, the foremost light in the world is a light of wisdom, or knowledge of freedom."}
{"prompt": "Light of Freedom", "completion": "Nothing is as exquisitely beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "So this description is kind of how we are before we come to meet the teachings of the Buddha in some way."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "That's a it's a more obvious experience and so we notice it pretty quickly."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "That understanding that connection, understanding or kind of making that connection through exploring well here's the feeling this reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Exploring Feeling Tone and Reactivity", "completion": "So that begins to give you the sense or the flavor or the taste of what it's like to experience the feeling tone before craving or attachment or a version arises because in that moment I mean going forward you know going forward you're you are experiencing feeling tone before craving because craving is not arising in this moment."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "My name is Maria Stratman, and I think you will be back next week, so."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "If we let go of things, then, you know, everything's going to be better, right? And I ran across an idea when I was reading a book on mindfulness by Joseph Goldstein recently, he has a new book out, and he talked about non-addiction, and I kind of like that idea, because non-addiction is just, it's not the antithesis of addiction, it's just not picking something up, right? Something about the way we talk about letting go of suffering sounds like we want things to be different than they are, and there's a stink of pushing things away to that."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "At the same time, she was married to Alfred Stiglitz, who was a photographer, and he took all of these really sensual, sexual pictures of her that he sold and displayed."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "If I do this, then I am going to be a better person, and we have this idea about what good looks like, what I am going to look like when I am my perfect self."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "But we have to train ourselves to notice in the present moment, oh, this is what happened."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "Oh, this is what happened."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "We have these compulsions."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "And I noticed the arising of that reaction."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "And I didn't pick up the reaction."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "It isn't pushing it away or fighting it."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "He's 75, right? But the man sang."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "And then we have a gig in Mogadishu."}
{"prompt": "Non Addiction", "completion": "So I invite you to not be addicted to being perfect, to find the joy in nonaddiction and above all, to find the joy in just being aware of this moment."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And that went on for many months, many months."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And then it was off to the internet or something."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "There was a little sense of concern, but not much."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And it's the picture is this, you know, this young guy who's in bed and he's like throwing off the sheets and he's got a pad and a paper and he's writing in, you know, like at the edge of his bed."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Upon waking up and rereading his notes from the previous night, Dowling confirmed to reporters that the new worry was even greater than he first thought."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "So that's the onion, but it's very closely paralleled."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Why is that funny? Because it's very closely parallels what was written by a researcher at Penn State who's sort of like the guru of worrying research."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And there's some real value in being able to simulate various futures."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "So there's a whole body of research around like affective forecasting, predicting our own states in the future, our own emotional kind of states."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "We underestimate our resilience."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And so we spend a lot of time kind of obsessionally trying to figure out which is right, which is wrong."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "We sort of overestimate how different those, you know, frost said right there to like the came to two paths right and I took the one less road less travel."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And that made all the difference, but that's often not true."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Now we can we can try to to plan and of course should."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "It feels like they're at that fork and it feels like we were looking the mind is really seeking that duke a free path."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "So we're loosening the grip on on controlling things were loose."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Now that leaves us maybe feeling kind of vulnerable, but part of our practice is cultivating a kind of courage and sense that the heart can weather the various tides of conditions."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "This intolerance of uncertainty runs runs."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "I can see myself as kind of compulsively seeking ground, seeking a kind of place to stand some sort of haven, something outside of change."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Thus clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "Matthew's mind is definitely a still a circus at day 56 right it's like we're just like just starting to scratch the surface."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And the basic approach is to begin to separate the stimulus from the fear response."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And so this is this is called systematic desensitization and mindfulness in a lot of ways is like unsystematic desensitization."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "It's just that's the logic of the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "So all of the panicky thoughts or emotions or memories or it all gets integrated in this way."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "One of the important principles is for the level of distress not to be too high and not to be too low."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And this is something that Shinzen Young, who's teaching Saturday, probably talk a fair amount about."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "This is can become overwhelming."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety", "completion": "And part of our practice is actually creating an integrated life where we feel like there's nothing to hide."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "There are great many practices in the Buddha Dharma for helping us to see a more skillful way to live our life when we run into difficulties."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "But the Sanskrit word for the result of action is vipakka."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And as we begin to be more attentive to our life and more attentive to our actions of body, speech, and mind, we begin to notice that some actions have results that we appreciate more than other actions."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "So it's very much in the realm of mindful awareness of what we're doing."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And actually, in my experience, that's how I know I've broken a precept."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "If I do something and I think, oh, that was nice, I will stub my toe or bump into a table or step on something."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "This, you know, this self-concern comes up and crowds out attention to what I'm doing."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And once we realize the relationship between cause and effect and the true interrelatedness of all things, we act out of insight or wisdom."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And when we really understand or really realize the unwholesome effects of our unwholesome actions, we'll stop."}

{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "How do we manifest it, how do we use it, how do we live? So we decide, well, let's live like a Buddha."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "This whole hearted, just cut a gear of roses, just dive into the ocean of Buddha."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "We don't go around also castigating somebody else that we see making a mistake."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "The instructions we're given in Zazen don't address the precepts directly, because when we're sitting Zazen, for the most part, we're already maintaining the precepts."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And maintaining the precepts allows us to experience the clarity of our being when it's not being directed by our conditioning and habit energy."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "The essence of the precepts is non-harming, and to be able to sit still in the first place entails some level of non-harming."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "So this is another thing, being aware of actions which create suffering, then we make our best effort not to engage in actions which create suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "So they're also training body and mind to act in a way that's consonant with our aspiration to be awake."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "This is living in vow, herein is one's peaceful life found."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "I wanted to end early so that we could have some discussion, so if there's something you'd like to bring up, please do, yes."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "And actually Master Muman has a verse at the end of each case, and the Muman Khan in one of them, case 17, he says, you'd better pay attention to what I'm saying or else when it comes time for the five elements to separate, you'll be like a crab in a pot, scrambling with all eight arms and legs to get out."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "I don't, you know, I'm not actually very skillful at guided meditation, but aren't there in vipassana training, aren't there meditations on impermanence that really, that really help you to focus on seeing that everything without exception arises and passes away so that you can begin to, you know, in the, in the Tibetan tradition, they have this slogan, death is certain, time of death is uncertain."}
{"prompt": "The Most Important Thing", "completion": "How can she, how can she deceive herself that way? I know she had a miserable childhood because I know that, well, you know, she, she was at that time, 90 years old, why should she go back and fret over her childhood difficulties, you know, she was on to a lot more than I was, you know, she just said, she just kind of dropped it said, my childhood was perfect."}
{"prompt": "Who is Responsible for my Suffering? (irc Wed Mini-retreat)", "completion": "So what does it mean to do this? When the world is a mess, you know, I come back to one of my Zen teachers primary instructions, which is to make your bed."}
{"prompt": "Who is Responsible for my Suffering? (irc Wed Mini-retreat)", "completion": "We have some agency over this, and there's an important part of practice which comes about when we begin to see that there are no small, meaningless details in our life."}
{"prompt": "Who is Responsible for my Suffering? (irc Wed Mini-retreat)", "completion": "In the Japanese Zen tradition, I'm forgetting the Japanese phrase, it's translated as attention to the small details of life is the family way."}
{"prompt": "Who is Responsible for my Suffering? (irc Wed Mini-retreat)", "completion": "And then the more we open, the more we settle, the more awareness is allowed to meet everything that's all the nooks and crannies of our heart, our mind, more and more is included into this fear of concern, this field of concern, field of love, field of responsibility, one of the, oh I think I'm supposed to take questions now, if you have a question, you're invited to type it into the chat and I'll be able to see it, but one of the, one of the ways that, the kind of classical examples of how we can take more agency and more responsibility through our practice is through the letting go that comes from forgiveness, you know, it's often been remarked that to forgive is a kind of letting go and it's not about the other person or people or what has happened and it's not about saying that's fine, it's alright, it has, it's this inner, this inner release and this inner healing that can come when our heart is freed from the other, is freed from that, some old story, so it's just one example of taking agency for our own suffering, I'm going to take a look now, see what's, so I'm not seeing so many questions, nice to see, nice to see participants from Oregon, from Israel, from Washington, Michigan, San Francisco, wonderful, one of the great blessings of this format is that it's bringing us together, bringing us together, all these different places, so maybe I'm aware of the time and maybe I'll just conclude by sharing this poem again, this is William Stafford, you reading this, be ready, starting here, what do you want to remember, how sunlight creeps along a shining floor, what scent of old wood hovers, what softened sound from outside fills the air, will you ever bring a better gift for the world than the breathing respect that you carry wherever you go right now? Are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts? When you turn around, starting here, lift this new glimpse that you found, carry into evening all that you want from this day, this interval you spent reading or hearing this, keep it for life, what can anyone give you greater than now, starting here, right in this room when you turn around, to be ready to turn around, to be here, I love this line, are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts? Are we waiting for some better moment? How often have we been so willing to sacrifice this moment for some imagined better moment? There's a great story in the middle of an intensive meditation retreat, Suzuki Roshi talking into the silent meditation hall, everyone is sitting very still and most likely in some kind of physical and mental anguish in the middle of an intensive retreat and Suzuki Roshi says, it doesn't get better later, so if it doesn't get better later, maybe I can let go of those fantasies and return and be here fully and reclaim the power, the agency, the beauty that comes with responding in this moment, being awake in this moment."}

{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 2)", "completion": "Now isn't that a bummer? Our life experiences create the memories that become the concepts that top down influence the way we think."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness, Conflict Resolution, and Neuroscience (part 2)", "completion": "So when the third aggregate of clinging is at work, that perception, that concept is working, it sends an expectation bias out into our awareness that alters incoming perception."}

{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And I haven't been back for a while, so it's really nice to see the group like this again."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And then the other side of practice is the side of cultivation, of cultivating the qualities of heart and mind that develop tranquility and peace and joy."}

{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "If you swing a hammer at first, it's a little awkward."}

{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So whatever we think about, whatever we do."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And it can be, you know, for those of us who practice regularly, it can be a really wonderful mental rest, a period of relaxation and tranquility."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "You know, the word that's used in neuroscience is plasticity, neuroplasticity."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "Even as we get older and we think, you know, really stuck in our habits, it's amazing how quickly we can develop actually something new."}

{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "It's a very simple, you know, simple thing but not necessarily easy to do."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And I am who I think that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So these are all pretty familiar to most of us, right? You know, all the little clingings of our days."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "We're wanting them to be different."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "But those activities don't address the root of the issue, the root of stress."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So even though we intellectually may understand it, the actual process is a deeper level of understanding."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "I didn't like people to be one-up on me, you know, that feeling of not wanting to be shown up, wanting to be the one that's right, you know."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And it was only through actually turning my attention to that process that I finally saw, like, you know, this one particular person I was really struggling with, that, wow, he's really insecure."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "The second thing to, that really helps to let go of clinging is to accept that we're clinging."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So it was very hard to look at it because mostly it was saying, I shouldn't be feeling this way."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So shifting the attention from the story, he shouldn't be that way to how I'm feeling, how I'm doing right at this moment."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "And by shifting the attention, you've already let go."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "You've already let go of the story."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "What are we clinging to? Have any of you connect with some procrastination you have in your life? So what are you clinging to when you procrastinate? The way things are right now."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "It's kind of uncomfortable."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "I cling to the idea that I'm a procrastinator."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "You know, it might be just the feeling of the body moving, you know, the body moving from sitting to standing."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "Because the body is always in the present."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "So we need to give it something else to do."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go and Cultivation", "completion": "It's like a systematic way of developing a lovingness of the heart."}

{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "At this stage, it would not yet be the time for criticism of these traditions, or of what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And one of the powerful aspects of this technique is that they get a very clear grasp on intention, and that precedes anything that happens, any action that we do."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And then finally, I think it's clear in the practice, again, from my own understanding, is that seeing the three properties of impermanence, suffering, and not self, are a very important part of that practice."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And there's the idea that it can be achieved within a question of weeks or months, initial understanding of those three aspects of ourselves, of our existence."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Again, any of you with any experience of the Goenka tradition, had something on top of that? Goenka, yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Yes, as you said, the three first days you go into the inspiration to calm the mind, and then you go through the body sensations, and the last goal is to just dissolve your body practically, so to feel all these little tiny lapas, as you said."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's very intense and it's great, it's really good."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Directly behind you, the Indian lady."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Again, anybody with practical experience can add anything on top of that."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So if we speak in terms of Satipatana meditation, these three traditions are fairly quickly picking different objects."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "You know, it always fascinated me that I have friends practicing in all three of these traditions, and when we meet as monks and we discuss our practice, it seems that it all comes together to pretty much similar experiences."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And that makes us also understand why many Vipassana teachers approach the practice through the glasses of Abhidharma."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "For me, that was kind of a key understanding."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "These are the preconditions for this series of experiences to take place."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Out of that, the Udaya Bhayanjana, rise and fall, that's a key experience."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And this is the main working ground for vipassana meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It is a little bit like you're standing by a road or somewhere and you see cars coming, going, coming, going, coming, going."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "But there's a shift of perspective."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And out of that seeing of danger there comes this beautiful nimbida."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Could you expand a little more on the dissolution of awareness? The dissolution of awareness, number three."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Is it sufficient to have experiences of rise and fall and dissolution only during meditation with eyes closed? Or is that something one needs to experience even walking around, eating, doing daily practices? Breakthrough through higher eight, nine and ten and further."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And he didn't retreat, not in the Goenka tradition, but there's another branch student of Uwakin, the lady, I forget the name right now."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Patisambhidamagam, we don't really know when it was composed."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So we see how the key things are still there."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's just giving us one description, this is another description, this is another description."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "That is the confirmation of not-self."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "If this question is all right, and I leave this to you, I would be very interested in perhaps others would as well in hearing what your own practice has come to be."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Okay, and how do you go about doing that in daily life? In daily life, I don't do vipassana meditation."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I have loving kindness, actually I don't like loving kindness, benevolence is much better."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And then there is the total letting go."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I was just trying to understand what is the interpretation because actually when you go to the Satipatanastadiya Goenka, we are using your book."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I was not talking about you."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "These are the three doors to liberation, and that reflects on your character to some extent."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "To remember where you read this? Because I've never come across this before."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I'd be happy to look for it."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I know exactly where it is in their library, so I can send it."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "It's a sensation, and it is in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "I had put him under posture because this categorization was based on the basic exercise used."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So there's a very precise location."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "That's Nyanna Purnika saying, because they do a lot of walking meditation, and this is what somebody here said before, that continuity of mindfulness, being aware of everything you do, and that fits very much with the basic idea of contemplation of postures."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So that is why Nyanna Purnika put it there."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Sukkham vidang, they give quotation marks in Pali."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "And so I lived there very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "But I think there must have been a reason why the Buddha gave so many discourses."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "The yeast is the knowledge of the sutras that makes it go all into a real bread of understanding."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So is that because I have read so much of conceptual, I didn't feel that."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "You know, it was just like there was no escape."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "Unworldly joy, not the worldly type."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "One conceptual as earth, I am earth, this is my earth."}
{"prompt": "Dynamics of Insight of Meditation", "completion": "So, thanks to all of you for the attention."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "So this part of the discourse on the foundations for awareness is the simplest of them all."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "So more and more of our body starts being, we feel really connected to it, it's our feeling embodied."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "For some things, that ability to just feel at the sensation level gives breathing room for it to resolve itself, to unwind, to dissolve, and for other things which are pleasant and enjoyable, there's breathing room for it to grow and expand."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "The more we're awakened to the body, the more the body is a field of sensations that we can feel, so much of the happiness and joy and well-being can be felt in an embodied way."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "So this simple exercise, maybe the exercise is not simple to do but always, but the simple instructions opens up to a vast world of possibility."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "When I have difficult emotions, I just find it so valuable to sit and meditate and just feel those emotions in my body, just trust the body, like the body is composting them, and I just kind of put them back into my body, into my body and feel it in the body."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (29) Resting in the Wisdom of the Body.", "completion": "May your body be one of your valentines."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I asked last night my wife, I said, what's the difference between anger and mad? And she said, there is no difference."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "We just are angry and we don't kind of, that's just it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "It wants to push something away."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And even if they're healthy, is anger the best way to accomplish what we're trying to do when we're angry? So to begin asking ourselves, what is this trying to accomplish for me? Is the beginning of separating ourselves from it to take an honest look at it? And if we can see what it's trying to accomplish, then some people will say, well, I don't know if I want to do that."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Is that really what they want to do? Is that reasonable? Is that what should be done? Or should that energy of anger go someplace else? Or be held some other way or approach some other way? And so to consider carefully, what is it that we're trying to accomplish? What's the purpose of the anger? Maybe the subconscious purpose that we haven't even thought about it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "That mindfulness has to do with bringing careful attention to our experience and what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so now I better be careful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Or maybe this is a time to go to the bathroom."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And sometimes there's so much charge around the anger, the whole system is kind of like ready to burst or pop or there's so much churning, it's like a volcano in there sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And so we have to go talk so we went to the conference room and it was hard conversation and I could feel the charge building up and at some point I said, can we just sit quietly for a few minutes rather than continuing with the conversation? So if I could recognize what was happening to me, I knew this is not, I'm not going to be any use for anybody in this conversation."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So then we can come back and be in a much more reasonable space and time is often a good healer of the charge of anger and just wait a few days, wait a week and things will settle down and settle down and then there will be more space and then you can be ready."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So if you want to not be possessed by the madness and be able to pull out, then learning how to discharge is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "What is really going on when you're angry? What are the underlying psychological factors that come into play with anger? What are the roots of the anger in you? And I like to think of anger, I don't know if it's always true, but I often take this perspective in looking at anger, that anger is a symptom of something deeper."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And the task is to discover that deeper thing."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So then to work with, then to work with the fear and the sadness."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "If you don't like articles, read the Wikipedia entry on anger."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And empathy is closely related for some people to compassion, to really feel what's going on, recognize what's happening at an emotional level with people."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But if we understand people what they're struggling with, life is difficult for people."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And then the first S is story."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "They said that because I hadn't responded to an email."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Is it true? And sometimes you can go go check."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And this is my story of what you did and why you did it and all that."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And hopefully, having done all the other processes first, the speaking can be wise and useful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But if you go to them and say, you know, when you said X, I felt really hurt or really, I became afraid."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I mean, it doesn't have to be big and dramatic."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Study the story, understand the stories connected to the anger."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And if someone holds very strong political views, feels very threatened or feels very angry about what's happening, how to have that anger without being possessed by it."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So those are my first thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Can you take the mic, please? So I'm so fond of Audrey today, specifically."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So nice that you're here and that you're speaking."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But I think related to the strong desire that leads to anger."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "See if you can really study it, look at it, try to understand it, and delve into it, and see if some of these steps of the madness are useful to, or all of them are useful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Learning about your anger, studying it respectfully, tenderly with reverence because of how deeply rooted it is in us is really a worthwhile enterprise."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "If we just treat anger as a surface phenomenon, we miss the opportunity to go deep inside."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And wisdom dispels the delusion that underlies the ways that our minds participate in our suffering and our struggle with life."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And believing that experience is more within our control and more governable than it actually is."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "They see change in what is changing, suffering where there's suffering and non-self in what is without self."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows, like a never departing shadow."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "But really, this is a natural human process."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "The Buddha was completely free from aversion, from craving, from stress, and was not at all passive."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "It also doesn't deny those, but it recognizes that it's a futile attempt to achieve security in the realm of conditions that is inherently insecure and unstable."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "The defilements, it's not a great translation for greedy version and delusion, but that's what that refers to."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Whatever is happening in the mind, just let it be."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "What you can do in the present moment is to act."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "We need to observe objectively."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Not that we have to feel bad about that, but that when we open to that, when we begin to really understand that on a direct, intuitive level, that pattern naturally releases."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Just this whatever level of experience is obvious, that's just simply what we can be with and know."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "But it's possible to have very, very profound insight in the midst of chaotic, busy day-to-day experience just through this interest in attention to moment-to-moment experience."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And yet you may have noticed, without the unpleasant or the pleasant thing changing, sometimes the resistance just falls away."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "So those are the reflections that I wanted to start us off with this week and we can continue next week."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "So, but I wondered about the relationship between those two, this objective, mindful awareness of experience as it's happening, and turning attention to the infinite."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "And, and, and at least for me, one of the things that that goes beyond awareness is wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana and the cultivation of wisdom", "completion": "Thank you all very much for your practice and attention and presence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Any of you here first time? Well, great."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's possible that a person sits at the end of the day and they're not very calm but it really helps to kind of empty themselves of all the stuff at work and to understand and see what's going on in some deeper level than they would otherwise about what's going on for them."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "An awareness which is capable of including everything within it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And also how to go deeper into it through kind of a stronger concentration, yoking mindfulness with concentration."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It can happen in conversations with people."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or it can happen in all kinds of walks of life where you're not really present."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So the teachers, those two teachers snuck into the TV room at the retreat center and were watching the football game."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or you might be present and attending to your breath, but you're making commentary about your breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Oh, that's a shallow, fast breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You're supposed to have a deep, relaxed breath."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I wonder if I should do something else and take up dancing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Why do they have these noisy doors here? They should lock the doors once we're here and people shouldn't be allowed to come in late."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So the, you know, having a shallow, fast breath is not a problem for mindfulness meditation whatsoever."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or if you did, we would see it as commentary and then come back and just be content."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Because many people have a lot of commentary about their body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And it's one of the reasons why it can start to be very relaxing to meditate because we free ourselves from all this stuff that's extra, that's not needed to rest at ease in our direct experience."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "If you're too relaxed, you might fall asleep, especially this time of day."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It can be helpful if from within your body you take a few long, slow, deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's a way of establishing a connection to your body, noticing it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Breathing in deeply, and then settle into your body as you exhale."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You might scan through your body and see if there's any easy muscles groups that you can relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Maybe as you exhale, you can relax your shoulders."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And if it stays soft, great."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Disappointment is just more commentary."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Seeing for a few moments if you can do so without judgment, commentary, without any reaction, as if those sensations are allowed to be there, and your job is just to feel what's happening in that part of the body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And gently let yourself experience the sensations of breathing, the body breathing, and every time you exhale, remember to let go of your thoughts so you can be more directly aware of the body breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And the body and mind working together, there's so much more intelligence, creativity, so much more information that we can live with that people tend to live much more wise lives when these two are working together."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But you can use the mics so everyone can hear, they'll be helpful with the green light on their button."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I found myself slowly going through different parts of my body and noticing where I was tens."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And I got to a point where I was relaxing them so much that I just kept falling asleep."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But then I would kind of go check in with my body again and release the tension where I found it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's not unusual for people to get sleepy when they meditate, when they begin to relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "kept pumped up by their desires, their wants, their fears, their anxiety, their tension."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Sometimes you're not supposed to sleep when you meditate, but it's hopefully refreshing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Do you want to go ahead? I think you're doing emotion next week, but I was wondering if you had any."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So in that meditation, we started with the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "If some body sensations, some part of your body, has stronger sensations than your breathing, some other parts of your body is more compelling, because calling on you, whether it's really pleasant sensation or unpleasant sensation, then the practice is to let go of focusing on the breathing and bring your attention into that place where the more compelling sensations are, just like you did for the hand."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And that tension is unnecessary."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And then if I get tense, my muscles tighten around the knee."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So if I really feel it, sense it, I feel hardness, pulling, tightening, sensations like that that are kind of intense."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "The word pain is actually an abstraction that covers intense sensations of many different types."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "We get in, that's commentary, right? We're lost in this whole world."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "You stay there as long as it feels like it needs to be acknowledged."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "An idle mind will get swept up in thoughts, and pretty soon I'm having gangrene and going to the doctor."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Or if I feel really hot, hot."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "But over time, if you keep doing this, you'll probably find that a lot of things that were or seemed in the past to be as too difficult, I can't do this, become easier and easier to be with."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "Spiritual, mental freedom in the midst of our life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And the official rest posture, if you're sitting this way, is just put your legs up like this and go like this, whatever you need to do, but this is one the next way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "There is one technique called the body sweep or the body scan that some people do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It's very concentrating for some people."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "We start with the breath and then we only go to some other place in the body when it calls on us."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And over time, like over months or something, you probably bring attention to many different areas of your body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And then if something happens elsewhere in the web, we go take care of it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And then if it's compelling, it means it's kind of like it wants attention."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So commentaries are thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I can sit and meditate all day."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And sometimes it's useful and sometimes it gets us in trouble."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "It looks like it's cut like diamond here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So some people find it helpful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "As a way of encouragement, just stay there, very simple, and don't get involved in more complicated thinking."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "And so don't worry about getting it right."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "So you can learn to identify the difference between hand versus hand, and just where you're still feeling it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "There's one compelling thing that is interesting to pay attention to, which we talk about together with the body, a sensory world, and that is sounds, listening, sound meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "The breathing is a great place for most people to develop stability, concentration, develop the mindfulness to be in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "We have a few people here who have taught this intro class and are senior practitioners here at IMC."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 2: Mindfulness of the Body", "completion": "I hope that you enjoy your body this week."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And so you're really intent and resolved and kind of centered in yourself as you walk."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But maybe with 20 mile an hour wind, you can kind of do it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "It pushes you a little bit, but your body kind of gets pushed a little bit and you kind of stand instead of straight and you push against the wind, lean against it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If you're too casual as you're walking, maybe 15 miles an hour is enough to push you off."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So you're going to try this high wire."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Get the idea? So the hindrances are like that."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If you have a wide boulevard, wide, wide, wide path and an easy destination to go to, then you could have a raging rage."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And see this is good, I'm centered, I'm here, I'm not anywhere else."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But if you're on your cell phone and someone says something phenomenally offensive to you that is so deeply kind of consequential for you and your life and your family and everyone, and you've just got filled with fury, then you might have an accident."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "It's either a movement you want to strike out at something, push something, strike out, or push something away, or push yourself away from something, kind of aversion from it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "You know, have a good time and sit with your ill-will."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "But rather it's so that you can get to know it really well."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So in that sense it's kind of unfortunate."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And then I would be a little bit irritated."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Just to show you the other side of it, once I was serving, it was the end of a seven-day retreat."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And the server might take your bowl and they ladle the food into the bowl."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And then no one else in the room knew what, except those two and me, knew what had happened."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And the monk said to the king, by water we should understand the mind."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "At least if you look at them or see how they act, that's where they put their faith, that's where they believe in, that's where they almost kind of get their identity from, that's where they get their juice, their energy from."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And underneath my protectiveness was I was afraid."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And it's not necessarily only to the world outside, it can be within oneself too."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "There's going to be tremendous aversion and ill will towards oneself."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "If you're only comfortable when you're comfortable, then your life is pretty limited."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And one of the things when you learn to be present for discomfort is we can understand it and see it and resolve it and deal with it in a much more realistic way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "We tend not to notice what's nice and helpful in the situation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Another thing you might do, it has to do with more spiritual practice, is to cultivate good qualities within us."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Try to avoid making decisions because you'll probably regret it later."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So we can be present for anger and anger doesn't have that per hand."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "And that can remind you of the values of what you have confidence in, the values you want to live by."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "So it's not just up to you to struggle with this, but you're actually supported by something much larger and bigger as well."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Ill Will", "completion": "Isn't that good? Finally, you're waiting all your life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And we sometimes will reconstruct things inaccurately."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And so the mind is reconstructing things."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And rather than debating with me or explaining it was different, my teacher just said, keep practicing, keep looking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And so I kept practicing with a lot of confidence and faith in this practice until the point came that I saw that consciousness also is in constant, can disappear, can vanish."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "So as the Buddha teaches mindfulness practice, he's teaching all these different forms of attention that we can do."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And in early Buddhism, we're not reifying, celebrating this as being ultimate in the final answer to everything."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And the word the Buddha used for this clear awareness, I like to translate it as lucid awareness, is pati sati, p-a-t-e-s-s-a-t-i."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Consciousness (5 of 5) Conscious of Consciousness", "completion": "And so I thought that maybe we can continue this kind of series and maybe next week we can look at attitudes with a look at how attitudes might play a role in how we know the world, how we know ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And it could also feed into a wish or an aspiration that we might have for this year."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "The Pali word is Kalyanamita."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So in this talk, I'd like to explore some of the qualities of good friends and good friendship as they are described in the suttas."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Similarly, if we associate with unwise people, say people who are focused very much on sense pleasure, sometimes the Buddha simply calls these folks fools, then we'll slide down into their ways and do harm to ourselves and to others."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "But a person who wraps powdered incense in the leaf of a tree makes the leaf fragrant."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So the first thing to notice here is that friendship is not left up to chance."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "This is called good friendship."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And the Buddha encourages us to use our discernment to look around at the people that we know and notice who has these wholesome qualities and then associate frequently with them and consciously emulate these good qualities."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And so I felt this sort of sense of interconnection and through her I could tap into that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And I realized, I discerned that that was a good quality to be more aware of in myself."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And so because of being with her in that way and having that discernment, I began to see within myself more of an untapped potential for interconnection."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "In the Dhammapada it actually says that virtue carries a scent that is more beautiful than the scent of flowers and can travel upwind and in all directions."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So I had been a little bit apologetic when I called her."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "If anything, there's anything like that in there."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "So it could be said that friendship is more of a verb than a noun."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Like someone pointing to treasure is the wise person who sees your faults and points them out."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Associate with such a sage, good will come of it, not bad if you associate with one such as this."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "You know, the fact that you want this enlightenment is your desire."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Don't say that, Ananda, don't say that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "We tend to stop there, but the sutra actually goes on, and it says, this is the Buddha speaking, it is independence on me as an admirable friend that being subject to birth have gained release from birth, that being subject to aging have gained release from aging, that being subject to death have gained release from death, that being subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair have gained release from these."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "It's not something you need to rush out and change unless there's something abusive happening."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "You know, if you talk about a challenge that you're having with someone that you trust, or if you talk about something that you're trying to develop in yourself, or something that you're interested in, you may deepen your own understanding just through sharing that."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And the most available person was this really obnoxious guy who complained all the time and criticized the teacher and had no particular faith in him and was really sloppy and messy, but was kind of available."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Why? Because it would strengthen him to be in the presence of this person during an isolated long trek through the Himalayas."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And I'm not saying that we should deliberately look for situations like that, but maybe the point is clear there somehow in that these associations that we have are what they are in a way."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Okay, now you can hear me."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "Hey, there's a passage somewhere in the scriptures where the Buddha addresses that specifically."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual Friends", "completion": "And so, first of all, we choose in some—maybe in a little bit passive way— that we choose to be with, say, a teacher or spiritual community because we want to have that good influence on us."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And instead, we're finding all kinds of things that aren't warmth and aren't tenderness."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Nikki talked about how there's these committees purification cycles."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Can we still be with loving kindness? Maybe we'll continue to say the phrases."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Is there a make that everything go away? Is there a way in which we can relax and soften all the ways that we divide things up and just be inclusive? So, that this practice becomes not only about befriending others, befriending ourselves, but also befriending one moment after another."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Before, did you see this heart? It chose to land again, bringing all its beauty to the desolate place."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So maybe in this way transforming the place where it's, so it's no longer desolate."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So in this way, as best we can to keep coming back to the practice and in this way, increasing our capacity for Medta."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "It doesn't have this grand expression or experience."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "May I be happy, but you're such a loser."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "You feel like you need some privacy or maybe there's emotions coming up or maybe there's a sense that you just want to be with your own experience."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So the invitation is maybe as best you can or in a way that feels healing and supportive to bring metta to the difficulties or allow the difficulties to just be in the metta practice."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And then maybe there's some creative way in which can be a support for you and for the unfolding."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "It's just a natural part of being a human."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Does it mean anything about you as a person? It doesn't mean anything about this practice."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Again, it's not a personal failing, but keeping in mind that Buddha spoke about these thousands of years ago."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And the dog just kind of calmed down, and I thought, oh, that's so great."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Wow, how much anger came up this out of me that I just was so surprised by like, where did that come from? And I didn't I couldn't even tell you exactly where it was directed, but man was I mad."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And for me, it's quite meaningful to say this is what has been pointed to in the Buddha by all these teachings by so many practitioners."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "But again, this idea of connecting can be a support."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And it's we can get stuck in there."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And just like I wish my suffering would lessen, may their suffering lessen."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Sometimes it might feel like this inner critic is really loud and persuasive and persistent."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "It's a causes and conditions that have come together."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "So can we respect ourselves for this coming to this retreat? It's a beautiful thing to do."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "And just recognizing that we don't have to make them be a problem."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "What is asking for acceptance? What is asking for some warmth? What is asking for some kindness? What is asking for some meta? Because often repeated patterns show up because there's some level of resistance, there's an aversion or there's some fear or judgment that are locked up inside or somehow."}
{"prompt": "Hindrances and Difficulties with Metta Practice", "completion": "Maybe it's helpful to go to the lovable being, the easy being and allow ourselves to be nourished there and then to come back to a lovable being or be with the lovable being and allowing the difficulty to be there while we're also with the lovable being, the easy being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "It can radically alter the course of a river."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And that, I would say, is true of a being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So the Buddha talked about a number of processes that kind of make up our being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "We know that the body changes."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "The process of perception, which recognizes a process that recognizes experience, that recognizes objects, that recognizes space and time, that recognizes distance, location, location, things like that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "All of our reactive emotions fall into this category."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And so these five processes are kind of interwoven in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "There's kind of two key understandings about the sense of self that happened."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So we might at particular times feel like I am the one who feels, or this feeling that I'm having, this is my feeling or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "There's apparently, I heard Greg Scharf talk about this in a Dharma talk, there's in where he lives or near where he lives, there, I think there's two, two rivers that kind of come together, two branches of river, I think that join in to make the Colorado River."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And so there can be, we could think of ourselves as these rivers or streams that are coherent."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "There is an understanding that the mental kind of formations, the mental activities, continue in a coherence beyond death, coherence in that, you know, there's this kind of arising and passing of phenomena."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "I don't think it's necessary to believe that in particular to have an understanding of a sense of not self, to have an understanding of how one can become free of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "We could call that something."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "The teaching of impermanence in my understanding is actually kind of deeper than that, that there isn't anything here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So I have more that I could say but I see that it's kind of late."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So if you're comfortable being recorded speaking into the room, great."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "That's what we think of is things arise and pass away."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "So there's never a stability in there where it actually takes its thingness and lasts for any stretch of time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And actually, if we think about the things, this can be a fun exploration actually."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "The fabric is getting worn and torn."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "The sense of self when it arises is actually a concept."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "What's the connection between what you're saying and awakening? So this is a great question."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "And this is actually another piece that is useful to reflect on that what the Buddha, the Buddha's whole journey was about trying to find his way to freedom from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Is There an Impermanent, Changing Self?", "completion": "But it is the exploration around the sense of self wherever it comes up is an exploration of what's in the way of awakening."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "When we use the word suffering, it often seems to evoke in us, in the English language at least, it evokes something big."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And then the Buddha pointing out in the second noble truth that there's a kind of suffering, let's say, that is related to something going on in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So there's this craving to have things be a certain way."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So when we have A and it causes B, A is not B, it's just kind of bumping up against it and making something happen."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So to me, that's a subtle, but also it's a distinction that I've seen in my own practice as having a truth to it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That when I actually can touch into the actual experience of craving, there's a kind of a leaning towards or a neediness or a kind of a wrapped around something."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "The arising of craving is the arising of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "This is the experience of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And so many experiences and many of our reactive emotions, for example, are experienced as suffering."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And earlier we fall down and we hurt our knee, we break our leg, there's unpleasant sensation."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And just as often, actually when we check it out through our day, we also have pleasant experience."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "You know, I know that walking out the door, I'm not going to be able to keep that orange sunset."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And yet it, there's something in the mind that somehow feels like what it should be able to do is to like, like, like pearls on a string be able to line up."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And we seem to have this kind of underlying belief that if I if I'm not able to navigate my life such that I kind of can have this pleasant stuff and not have the unpleasant stuff that somehow I'm doing it wrong."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "As opposed to just simply recognizing, well, this is the nature of things, you know, pleasant comes unpleasant comes."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Dissociation with the unpleasant, there's a happiness that comes with that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But our minds don't understand so much that it's like, in looking at this whole process, so in the moment when we get something that we want, we get a double hit of pleasant."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "What does that feel like? Get familiar with that feeling itself and notice the unpleasantness of it."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And that created the idea of a latte in my mind and that sounded good and, you know, the craving for the latte sprung up."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "We see that the craving has essentially been convincing us, you know, when we're caught in the throes of craving, it convinces us that the only way for this feeling to go away, for this unpleasant, tilted kind of dissatisfied feeling to go away is to get the thing that we want or get rid of the thing that we don't want."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "This helps us to see, kind of to undermine the craving's perspective, that yes, that thing, having that thing will make me happy for a long time."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But that all goes away pretty quickly."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And this is actually, you know, we can see this in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Why can't they have a little more color? You know, I'm oriented to what I don't like."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "As soon as something is fixed and it's okay, it's like, okay, well, it's okay, but there's probably something else I better look for."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That's where we are with sense pleasure a lot of the time."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Notice that it's gratifying."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "But then notice how long it lasts."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "There was a very strong sense of craving for the competent identity and a craving for the non-existence of the unworthy identity."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Well all I need to do is to figure out what the craving about this unworthiness is because that needs to go away."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That's kind of the craving for non-existence."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "You know, the feeling of kind of, I have got to make sure this stays."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Liking a state of mind, wanting it to continue."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Not liking another state of mind."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So liking it when we're excited, but not liking it when we're sad."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So the looking at this begins to kind of unmask some of the beliefs and the delusions that are embedded in the craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So I should stop doing that."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "That's where another form of practice is really useful."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Given that we might think, oh, I shouldn't be feeling this craving."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "So this was on a long retreat."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And yet I really wanted to look at people."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "I could feel the kind of pull."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Like, no, I'm not going to look at people."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Wow, it's really strong when somebody is right there."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "And in that moment, just as they would go into the building, the whole thing would end."}
{"prompt": "Letting Go of Craving", "completion": "Sorry, there's no time for questions or comments."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And if you didn't notice, no problem."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But no matter how it was, however it was your day unfolded today, this is a beautiful practice and worthwhile doing."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Part of caring for ourselves is learning to be, to be with the difficulty in a caring way."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And to be able to respond to difficulties in a way that is skillful, helpful, and healing."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Part of loving kindness practice is learning how to do that, or maybe actually learning, loving kindness practice is doing that."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Because sometimes on an emotional level, we might feel challenged or lost or overwhelmed."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And last night I talked about a number of ways in which we can work with difficulties."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "The different perspectives, different frame of reference than the way we usually look at them."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But there's this wide range of states associated with metta, this whole range of colors and flavors."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Jill Shepherd says that compassion is the love child of metta and dukkha."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "But it's turned specifically towards distress or difficulty."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And highlighting, we know how to care for others."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And something that I appreciate so much about self compassion is that it supports us to make some changes in our lives, not because we are inadequate, but because it cares."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "And then it gets resolved in some kind of way."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "You don't always have to get bored with it and come up with other ways."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "We can see it or experience it from a different angle."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "We're introducing new intentions, new thoughts and disrupting patterns and habits and lessening the inner critic."}
{"prompt": "The Malleability of our Hearts and Minds", "completion": "Thank you for your practice."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And that's not to say that what happens in the world doesn't impact us, or doesn't matter, or doesn't require our action, but that we work to be fully accountable for the anger that we experience, while finding some way of being accountable without blame, without self-blame, which is a delicate balance."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "This is a famous line from a Sufi teacher, it says, overcome any bitterness that may have come because you are not up to the magnitude of the pain entrusted to you."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And the more clarity with which we can see this, the more we begin to see it within others, the more we can see it's like dukkha leaking, suffering leaking out when the container of mindfulness and love is not adequate when the understanding is such."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "I think it was Stephen Levine said, forgiving people means you let them back into your heart even though you may never let them back into your home."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "We need to acknowledge that we're not, some of forgiveness practice is grieving harm, grieving loss."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "It's not a suppression of what's, what's arising."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Even then, though, forgiveness is still an option."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So this process of forgiveness, some of it may happen on its own just as we go about our business doing this practice."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So to make this concrete, I was thinking about an experience with an evangelical person who was outside of a 7-Eleven doing a kind of conversion pitch to me."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So these strong ideas of who I am, what makes me good, what makes me bad, what my views are."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So what does this mean? Anger arises towards others in an interpersonal context."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And it's speaking to this, that when we hold that fixed view of who the person is at the deepest level, what's good, what's bad, when we hold that, it provides that place to hang our anger in a way."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "That's being pointed to when we say, you know, to see the ways in which anger spills out from them, to see a more complex picture of how suffering arises in them and then spills out and perhaps harms us."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "As we affirm more and more the experiences of our life, whatever they may be, the five senses and thinking, however we cut up the pie of experience."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And he said, if you sort of try lots of different things, try to work with anger in all different ways, there's still some holding on to something, give that person a gift."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And I did not feel like giving."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "With the forgiveness I feel there is some sort of punitive measure that can still be punished and forgiven."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And so we don't have to get real intense about, like, okay, I'm doing this for myself, for others."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Yet revenge brings really instant satisfaction."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "And those complications, I mean, the poisoned root part of that phrase, it's not just in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "But it takes me longer to forgive myself if I did something wrong or I perceived that I hurt somebody."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "Remorse sounds worse, maybe, but actually in this context it's the good one."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "So it's something to bear in mind, but yeah, I really did not get to anger towards self which is a huge theme."}
{"prompt": "Working With Anger: Part 3", "completion": "May it ripple out and be a cause for less suffering and more joy and ease."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "Some of it has to do with the complexity about ourselves, that we have to strain, we have to hold back, we have to be a better doer, we have to be, or we're an adequate doer, or what should I be doing, and how should I be doing, and the mind gets complicated trying to figure it all out."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And it's not uncommon for people who practice meditation to have an agenda to become concentrated, to have an agenda to become clear and have a quiet mind, and a peaceful mind, a calm mind."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And so to learn to ride the ups and downs, the calming and the agitation, is simply keep it simple."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "The simple thing to do is just be agitated and then recognize it simply."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Keeping it Simple", "completion": "And the complexity is, this is not good enough."}

The pain, the suffering, this insomnia is the doorway, is the invitation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Insomnia, Pain, and Metta", "completion": "Hello, dear human being who is suffering, this is what suffering is like, ah, welcome to acknowledging, to opening to the human condition for yourself and all other beings, you can be sure there are other beings in that moment in time in the world who are also either having insomnia or having pain, thousands, thousands of us, given that we have, there are what, seven or almost eight billion of us or something like that now, I think the most recent count I heard, there are, there would be hundreds if not thousands of human beings in that moment who are having the same condition as you are having."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So sometimes we go externally but we want something."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And doubt is said to be the most dangerous of the five hindrances, especially for the sake of meditation practice or spiritual practice, because doubt can cause a person to abandon their spiritual practice, to abandon their meditation practice, if you have enough doubt about it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And probably for all people, sooner or later, some people have a lot of doubt to begin with or have a lot of doubt about what they're doing."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Doubt can arise from insecurity."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "They're a little bit similar to the first one, but insecurity that what I'm experiencing now isn't good enough."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "We don't get rooted in ourselves in a deep way."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So, okay, well, over there, there must be."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So they get up and go somewhere else, dig five or six feet, give up."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Let's go up and somewhere else."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "People will doubt their practice, doubt their spirituality when it gets kind of rough, when things are not going so well."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "It can get rocky sometimes because the person you're having to relate to is so unreliable when you meditate."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "The teachings on not-self can cause a lot of doubt in people's minds."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "There can be doubt, you know, the whole idea of letting go."}

{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Or doubt, you know, mindfulness is so simple."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "There's definitely a lot of healthy doubt that can be there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "It seems like it's asking something of me, and it's taking me to a place that seems so lofty."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So what to do about this doubt? One of the most important things is to recognize doubt as doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Because the believing the doubt that is often at much of the problems with limitation."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And they begin to kind of disentangling themselves from the ideas and the concepts of the fear and then being caught in the emotions of the fear and maybe they'll kind of dissipate or settle."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And so we investigate and see what's underlying it."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And in that great, great space there's a room for there to be a little bit of doubt bouncing around."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "But if we ride the doubt really close, so concerned about it and believing it and engaging in it, then it would claustrophobic and it's much more of a bigger deal."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "Don't engage it, don't be for it or against it, but just keep opening the awareness up as big as it can be and just let it kind of float there."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "It doesn't matter what it is, we just kind of turn the attention away from the thing we have doubt about ourself, the teaching, the teacher, the whatever and turn around and let the attention come really in here and feel what it's like to be in a human body that's experiencing doubt."}
{"prompt": "The Five Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So we turn away from the object of attention to the subject of who is experiencing it."}

{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "The anger has many different varieties and forms."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And that's very important to say because maybe not all anger is really terrible."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And this maybe in many different situations in Buddhist practice, the motivation is really the key."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know, how do we relate to anger? What's the gut way we relate to it? Some people's relationship to anger is it's always justified."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Some day people's relationship to anger is anger is a proof that I am inherently weak and incapable and then you feel you're weaker."}

{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And meditation is a great place to be angry."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "That makes, that can change, can change situation dramatically to know you're angry when you're angry."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And if you just kind of calm down, but the original problem is still there, then, and you don't address it, you don't deal with it, but I don't think that's healthy."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But diffuse the situation, diffuse yourself, and then learn."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But I just kind of let my thoughts be what they would do."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And I tried to understand what was the nature of the phenomena."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Many different causes of anger."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So to learn what's going on, is it connected to frustration? Frustration is often frustrated expectation or frustrated desire."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "That's why we brought lunch with us."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But these small desires, you know, they're reasonable."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "But maybe they're not how we think they are."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "That's pretty bad, right? They were lined up, ready to take it and he pulled in."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And that's part of the story too."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "You know, or this person has some kind of issue."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Or this person's a human being."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "What else is going on here? But sometimes substitution is helpful."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And how it's really important they don't come late again."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And then you find out the next day or that evening or sometime the person was on the way to the meeting."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And then you, when the person shows up and says, oh, when you didn't show up, this is one interpretation I had."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "And if you don't react to your enemy, someone gets angry with you and is furious with you, and you just stay calm and cool, then you're just witnessing your enemy hurting himself."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So you come to the last step."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Sometimes the problem is in the world out there."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "So I showed up and I made eye statements."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I was visibly shaking a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "We were able to have a working conversation and figure out something for the future."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "I meant to say it earlier."}
{"prompt": "Anger", "completion": "Are we always looking at ourselves, me, myself, and mind? The word, the psychological study used the expression of me, myself, and mind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "A fascinating man lives in Australia, so to have him here is kind of unusual and kind of special to have him."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And it'll feel like something, not only something that safeguards them from making mistakes, but something that's very nourishing, supportive."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Calm is the great gift of the practice or peace."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "In the village there was a young woman, a teenager, who was still living at home with her folks."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But she didn't want to tell them that it was her friend down the street, you know, another teenager, and get him in trouble."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So his equanimity around that, its acceptance of that, and not protesting, but just going along and maybe supporting the girl in that way, and supporting the village, and not being reactive, and angry, or something."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "There's a very sad social thing that if a person has no bearing on a person's praise and blame, then they're kind of uninteresting and the person will kind of move on to the next person because, you know, somehow that's where the energy is."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And then there's success and failure."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "You have to kind of succeed."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "One of the gifts of mindfulness practice for me has been a much higher capacity to be at ease with physical pain and emotional pain as well."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But if I'm reactive and cut up and anxious and angry and hot around it and feel like it's a personal failure that I should have pain, then I can't don't have the ability to see it clearly and study it, which I think is a respectful thing to do with pain."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And I don't know what you can do to chocolate pudding to make it awful."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Is this something that I should be caught by? Is this something I should be concerned with? Is my reaction that I have right now, is this the reaction that I want to have? When I react this way, where am I coming from? Am I really coming from that centered place, the place of peace inside? Or am I coming from my agitation? Am I coming from my defensiveness? Am I coming from my sense of entitlement that I should be able to get whatever I want? Am I coming from my frustration? Am I coming from my desires that are being frustrated? Most people want something and the world is brilliant at not providing it to us 100% of the time."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So the question is, what are you going to do about that? One possibility is just refine your desires."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "What center of the world inside of you do you want to come from? That you know where you feel complete or satisfied or feel like that's a place where you're nourished."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And so to be able to see a thought and just see it as a thought."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "That someone doesn't do something that I thought they would should do."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "My capacity to be upset doesn't have to be hijacked by what I think that person did."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Is upset related to the words settled? I don't know what the language are, but."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And for us to discover and understand ourselves in a deeper way."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And then hopefully it goes easier."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So mindfulness is kind of, it's a gift of mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And so sometimes what the gift of mindfulness, of seeing clearly, it allows us to step back and have a broad overview of what's happening here, rather than be caught by the details or the particularity of the moment."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "I certainly have the capacity of what's called the delusion of permanence, is to feel something and somehow there's, I don't know what gene there is inside."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "But if you happen to have that much time, you can try."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And that is take a three-breath journey."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Three inhalations, three exhalations."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And let your thoughts, whatever your concerns are, be in the background."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Every time I come here, whatever topic is being addressed, it's already something that's on my mind."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And you've identified it with the word equanimity."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And it might be if you fill it out a little bit more."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And it might be easier to maybe at some point have a talk with your father to explain why this is so important for you."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "Is this so and letting them, you know, move on, pass through you."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "If we're not equanimous or calm or mindful, then we probably don't have all the information we need."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "There's all this, you know, it's called traffic calming."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And so they have these temporary speed bumps."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "So I was walking down here today."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And I saw that solid had fallen down."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And that was the first thought I had."}
{"prompt": "Equanimity", "completion": "And then I could feel and see in my mind in my body resistance to doing anything."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "Maybe it's kind of grown a little bit or learned some things."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "It's like, oh yeah, I'm here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "What is that? What's that experience? We have a lot of different identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "You know, I, I would notice every now and then probably more often than I remember that I was actually happy."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And so, you know, rather than seeing it as both come and go, the mind kind of solidified around one of those identities."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And we can see one thing that that is kind of useful to recognize at times is that some of those strategies, you know, not all of them."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "But some of the strategies that we come up with are kind of strategies to navigate our world, our lives, strategies to navigate what we've met in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "You know, that if I hated myself, maybe I could become the person that that person, I thought that that person wanted me to be or something."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "They come into being as a result of how we've navigated our lives, what has happened to us, our cultures are conditioning."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "So there's a little bit of suffering there sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "But it basically describes how at one way to look at that chain of dependent origination, it describes a set of processes by which a sense of self comes into being."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "It was coming up on retreat when I was listening to people ask questions in the hall."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And I was feeling it and kind of feeling the suffering of it, feeling the constriction of it, feeling the tightness of it, all of that, just watching this."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "We kind of have identities in terms of people that we grew up with."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "And so a lot of identities, a lot of ideas around self connected to that identity and other."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "It's like these suffering conditions came up out of what happened in our lives, you know, came up like my self-hatred, you know, I didn't ask for self-hatred."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "You know, it happened because of the conditions of my life and the relationships in my life that it was conditioned."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "Understand when they make us act unskillfully, understand how they create suffering."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "But this was a long process looking at the self-hatred and I'm kind of collapsing it into a very short story right now."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "It was no longer such a threatening experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Exploring Identities", "completion": "Not like there's a reservoir of self-hatred down there."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And there's a kind of a kind of an opening of the container that the heart can rest in that place where it is not angry or confused or hating or trying to hold on to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "But what we usually think of when we hear the words ease, peace, Okanus is, yeah, I don't have to do anything."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And the qualities that are helpful have their own movement towards action."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "Today, I'm going to read a Naliyah's version."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "Both of those offer a lens."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And then the, the impermanent nature of experience, noticing the arising in the passing of experience that also supports, we can kind of attune to that."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "In particular, we start to see that everything arises and passes and the movement to try to hold on to stop that flow to kind of say, okay, I like the way it is right now, let's leave it here."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "Mindfulness, there is a body where there are feelings, there are mind states."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "When we have that place where there's more sense of the mindfulness being carried through moment after moment."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And that is when the mind that the kind of the capacity of the mindfulness and the power of the mindfulness starts to show up."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So this is anger arising, what is the experience of anger arising."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And that can be experienced in a couple different ways essentially what what what the continuity of mindfulness is is a form of concentration."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "So the continuity of mindfulness is kind of where the power of the power of the mindfulness starts to reveal itself."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "It evokes for me the the famous teaching that the Buddha gave to Bahia."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "The seeing the hearing the the sensing the the mental activities that are connected with those to see them as processes."}
{"prompt": "Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness", "completion": "And then this teaching then encourages me to notice those as those two are just horizons."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So it's about cultivating the heart of well-wishing or of kindness."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "And so basically, we start where it's easiest."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "I can actually drop your attention to your heart area and just feel yourself appreciating."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "Or it could be the way that you are with your kids or grandkids or friends."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So voices of doubt may come up, the voices of criticism for the moment you try to let them go."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "If I have done anything to harm anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I ask for forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "This could be a child, it could be a really good friend, it could be a mentor or a coach, it could be a beloved pet."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So just as we want those things, this other person also wants these things."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "May you be strong and healthy."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So we'll bring this same well-wishing to our own body and life."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "So knowing just as we wish to be happy and safe and healthy, so does everyone here."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "You can expand your sense of well-wishing to include everyone here in the room today."}
{"prompt": "Brahma-vihara Series: Metta - Guided Meditation", "completion": "May all beings be free from suffering."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "It's really kind of one of the doors towards becoming freer and wiser and more present in their lives."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And I'll tell it to you the way that I was told and then I'll change it slightly because it has to do with monkeys."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so this analogy is supposed to be metaphor, analogy for six different aspects of how we live in the world."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But the taste and also we have tactile senses we do."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "You know, remember all the different things that the neighbor did that was wrong over the years."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Not only a red car, but a blue car and a pink car and, you know, having lots of cars would be great."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And one is not better than the other, just how different minds work."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So it could be commentary."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Oh, the ring of a cell phone."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So these are different layers."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And most people live in the layer of discursive thinking."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Discursive thinking, thinking, analyzing, contemplating is an important part of human life."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And then we see more clearly actually what's going on."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "How much do you invest in your thoughts and your discursive thinking and thinking about things? Invest because we often have a sense of, sometimes there's a sense of promise in these thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "How much do we credence do we give to the worry that's part of the thinking? The fear."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so they're often looking and ruminating and thinking about what's wrong, what's wrong with me, that I'm somehow wrong, I'm a loser, I failed or I can't really do something."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so when the rumination, when the thinking, the discursive thinking is circulating and repeating over and over and over again these kinds of thoughts, it's very debilitating."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Oh, that's what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And then beginning to find a way to make that clear recognition."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But what about that place? The adult life takes a step back."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so it's nice, anticipatory delight in thinking is nice."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "At this moment I'm aware of the temperature of my body."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "I'm thinking about, you know, something else."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And sometimes a simple recognition is not enough."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "It's a very valuable way to connect to ourselves is to be with our breathing."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "But if you take drops of water and drop it into a bathtub, eventually the bathtub will be filled, but each drop is inconsequential."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Some people find loving kindness meditation is good."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And you certainly see it in other people sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And so the advantage of feeling this thinking muscle, the sensations of tightness around thinking is that then it's possible to relax it."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "The advantage of doing this is that the tension associated with thinking, if it's still there, it's kind of like if you have a toothpaste, one of those tubes of toothpaste, and you stay squeezing it."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So if we have this physical, emotional tension associated with thinking, the toothpaste comes out."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And you can let go of your thinking momentarily, but if the tension is there, you'll think again."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And also what is the relationship we have with our thinking? And I think many people have never occurred to them that they have a relationship to their thinking."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "It's a rich, rich world, the world of thinking."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And the way to begin having a different relationship to discursive thoughts, the way to bring the parent into the room, or the way to let this thinking grow up, become more mature, in the mindfulness practice is to start doing the very simple act of recognizing, I'm thinking."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And I'm repeating this because the idea is to do it often enough and clear enough that at some point you're a little bit standing away from the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "You all have a mature adult in your mind that I would suggest kind of to be provocative to get your attention."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "So one of the monks wanted to help."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "Or maybe you can put some of the stuff down long enough that you can see it from a different perspective."}
{"prompt": "Freedom From Thinking", "completion": "And one of the results for me from doing this mindfulness practice in relation to my thinking is nowadays I feel my thinking is my friend."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "And so can there be a kind of a relaxing, a setting aside of mental tension."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Allowing", "completion": "There will be a moment when you recognize that mindfulness will return."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "And so if you can soften those muscles of your face, you might notice a little bit of a shift in your mind state."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "And then how they can soften and relax on the out breath."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "Maybe another deeper breath before allowing the breathing to return to normal."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "And then as a way in to exploring a relaxation of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "This whole time we've been exploring being aware while relaxing."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "In my experience as I open to that aware of resting, I also sometimes become aware of some other things like the breathing or sounds happening around."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "Sometimes I find as I rest in this space or connect to this aware of rest of relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "There at times becomes an awareness of tension arising or non rest arising and that's okay."}
{"prompt": "Relaxation Meditation", "completion": "To explore this if this feels useful for you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But one thing I should say is that if you have trouble hearing, there's hearing system devices."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And I've been part of this community, meditation community, for 26 years now."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The group preceded me, started about 1986 or so."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "By that time, I'd spent over 10 years of my life in Buddhist monasteries and meditation centers."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so I was asked to take leadership of the small group that then slowly grew."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And it's been a remarkable journey."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "I think the mindfulness practice itself is quite effective and powerful."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And I'll talk more about that in the last class, the insight part."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So the line between meditation outside is pretty porous, pretty open."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But the focus kind of will be on meditation, and the instructions will be given sequentially."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "That just leaves people confused."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So what happened five seconds ago is not that important."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "We're not grabbing onto things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And it's fairly common for people who get a hang of how to do this to find that it's very calming in their life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we're going to talk about meditation."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So if you're sitting on the floor, I actually recommend you don't actually sit cross-legged, but rather keep one leg in front of the other."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And that way they're not being stretched unduly."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So it makes kind of like a nice circle here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Or if you have your hands too far forward over the edge of your knees, it might also kind of pull you forward."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so you want to have your hands pulled back a little bit so that the elbows are kind of lined up with the edge of your rib cage here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Some people will tip their chin up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Be very careful that kind of numbness doesn't build up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Some people have to use a backrest and that's fine if that's the case."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "If you get really strong support, firm support and lower spine, then the upper spine can be self-supporting."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Now, to help with this, it's really good to settle down, to develop some calm and stability in the mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But remember, even though the focus now is on breathing, if you can't stay with your breathing, the practice is to notice what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So taking a posture that is alert and calm."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And then beginning by taking a few long, slow, deep breaths."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Parts of your body are engaged with breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And then bring your attention to that part of your body where breathing is most compelling."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So let yourself be present for where breathing is easiest to experience or most compelling."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So just hear with a simple experience of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And then to help you stay with your breathing, you can very quietly in your mind have the thought in as you breathe in, out as you breathe out."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we'll continue for one more minute in this last minute."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "A ship which is not anchored is going to drift off the currents and the winds and just kind of wander off or, you know, float onto shore and crash."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we don't want to get lost out at sea or crash against the shore."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So do you have anything you want to say about that meditation that we did? Any questions about it or do you want to report a little bit what happened? In a room this many people and there is a wide range of experiences of how it goes, all of which are permissible."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So that is kind of like the aim of one of the benefits and come from mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So next week I will talk more about it, but for now you are welcome to change your posture or what you can do is ignore it, if you can."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "To whatever degree you give a sense, it is reasonable."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So trying to be more conscious of it, that means I would have to exert effort and think about that rather than breathe naturally."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And generally, in our particular tradition here, we don't, for the most part, emphasize any particular way of breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "It's very variable from person to person."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And after all, we're in California."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so I find it difficult to maintain the awareness."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So you might want to kind of look a little more carefully."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "The idea of ignoring it was only for this week, because if you can, because the first week, it's nice just to get really familiar with the breathing, develop, kind of get comfortable with it, learn to be with it, come back to it, learn about this movement of letting go of your distractions coming back, and just kind of get a real hang of what, feeling for what it's like to be meditating on the breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So we know how to bring our emotional life, our psychological life, our mental life, our social life."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "But so you give the mind something to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so that's part of the territory."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "It knows what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So you're not tempted by things."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And you can put these meditation timers on your app and then they have a very nice bell, you know, that you listen to rather than the smartphone kind of generic thing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So you get to kind of slowly build to more."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "While it's offered freely, no charge for it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "So anything, any last words? Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And so there is this hand out there."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "Also, let me introduce to you a few people here who have been longtime meditators and actually teach this course sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Meditation - Part 1: Overview", "completion": "And Tom is sitting back there, this clipboard."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then a body that's on fire, really, you know, just on fire."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then this week, during the week, experiment a bit."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then mental images, which are often very fleeting, very quick."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "To just let ourselves be, leave ourselves alone, we might say."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And first, bringing some attention to any places in the body where you tend to experience emotion, emotional type sensations."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "If we were really angry in this moment, we would very likely be experiencing a great deal of this emotional type sensation in the body."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "It's actually a spatial location where we hear, have the experience of hearing internal talk."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And then we'll see if we can bring mindfulness to this image."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So I'd like to start with the introduction to that sutta, which I find very inspiring."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So good news about this Dhamma is that it's not something that he made up or kind of concocted or created this like complex philosophical system around."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So the air is all around us, right? In some way, as human beings, we're all swimming around in air, right? And then as you do the practice, so many of you are probably doing the paying attention to your breath practice, right? You tend to your breath as it goes in and out."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So technically speaking, we're about three-quarter made of water as human beings, right? Which is actually about the same proportion as the earth, right? And I understand that about every seven days you replenish your supply of water, right? So, you know, get rid of it and come back and drink more."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So the earth element is the element of solidity, right? So solidness of the ground, the ground that's always supporting us."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "75 is a little cold, right? Maybe 60 to 75 is like okay, and anything outside that's too cold, too hot, right? The body starts to be unpleasant, it complain a little, right? So we need these conditions as well, right, of temperature, right? Then we actually need this earth element too."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And I think it's helpful to reflect on this too, in terms of our connection, our interconnection with the earth and actually with everything, right? So, you know, I said if we don't drink water for a couple days, we'll die, right? But supposing you've got water, but you didn't get food, so also after some period of time, your body would start to suffer a lot, right? So where does the food come from? The food actually comes from the ground, right? So the food grows from the ground, in the earth element, through water, through sun, right? So through the heat element, through the liquid element, right? Then this plant is allowed to grow, right? Even if you're a carnivore, right, usually the animals that you eat would eat the plants, so somewhere along the line it gets back to those plants, right? And then those plants are harvested by someone."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And you can actually do this practice in several different ways."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So I mean basically it's a way to help us to somewhat disidentify with that experience that we're having and disidentify not meaning to separate, right? But it's like to not identify but also completely connect with it."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I mean even ways like say, you know, the part of the liquid thing is that we have the circulatory system, right? So like blood and stuff, so going around in our body all the time, pump, pump, pump, right? And there actually is also this whole circulatory system in the cities too, right? Sometimes people feel like oh in the city it's hard to connect with nature and the elements, but all this stuff is there too."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I mean, is it sort of like meditation when you're trying to do mental noting? I mean, what's the best way? Should I not judge myself and just first notice it for a few weeks before trying to actually correct it? Or, you know, sometimes I find myself judging myself and getting angry."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And what makes you notice that? Like people tell you or you feel bad or, you know."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And, you know, actually I think that, like, all of practice to some extent, like all of this whole path, which is about suffering and the end of suffering, is becoming increasingly tuned into different levels of discomfort that are there that otherwise we're kind of gloss over or ignore."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Maybe don't, you know, the body doesn't get enough breaks, you know, to move around and stuff."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So now I'm bringing attention to this."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And then, yeah, doing what you can, I think, with the physical body."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And then we get to the elements here."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and was seated at the crossroads with a cut-up in pieces, so too a bhikkhu practitioner reviews the same body as consisting of elements thus."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So we're like in harmony with them in some way, right? The birds, the squirrels, the fish, you know, breathing the water, you know, all that."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So some people are into that, some people are not."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So if you live with other people and if they're also brushing their teeth and you're not, right, it becomes noticeable, right? So it also is always helpful if there's other people who do that, like who meditate."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Then the opposite is restlessness, right? So you're like, sit down, but you're just like so wanting to jump out of your skin, right? So sometimes it's in the mind, like you're worried about something a lot."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So with all of these, you bring awareness to them."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "And then aversion, not wanting something."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Also, if you live with other people, of course, you have to like negotiate at that time."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "I'm hungry, right? Okay, desire, you know, like that."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Fourth one, I'll let it go because I'm only human and, you know, I'll sit through three hindrances."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Like this is what it's like."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "Because basically anytime that we want things to be different than they are, that is like fighting the law of gravity, right? So here I am on the road and I want to be in Muir Woods and I'm not."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "It's like some version of like, I want to be somewhere I'm not."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "But, you know, so it's good to see that it's like, oh, okay, this is what the dynamic is here, right? I've been clinging to something."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So this is a sharing blessings."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "You can feel the water in our mouth, connecting to the water element, feeling the temperature, how it is in our body right now."}
{"prompt": "Four Elements", "completion": "So we appreciate ourselves for having come here tonight and we share the blessings from our practice with everyone here and with all the other beings made of the same elements, seen, unseen, near, far, in the air, on the earth, in the water."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Contact with people we love has been limited."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And sometimes what's been touched is what's been unresolved in our life."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "So I can well understand that the sense of frustration that people have these days and one of the opportunities in this practice is to turn around and have insight, really go into this objective experience and what's really going on here for me."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "One is to understand it, resolve something that needs to be resolved, or to get a different perspective on what's happening so we can operate more from wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And so to wait, if possible, until the anger has dissipated and then address the issue, not ignore the issue, but then maybe you're in a better place to reflect and think and do."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "I called it a clean anger or a clean anger, very clear and clean."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "And it was, I said something and someone that I think was maybe disrespectful and the person came back right away and said, Gil, never say that again."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Isn't that great? The proper purpose of anger."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "My idea is that more often than not we can act more effectively when we don't act from the anger."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "Now some of it is I think it comes for good reason."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "The oppressors, the dominant class of people, often white and white males, could feel like it's fine for them to be angry, but it's not okay for other people to be angry."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "That somehow our inner reactivity is, we contribute to the way in which our heart responds, reacts to what's happening around us."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "The anger can be there as its own thing, and we don't have to become the angry person."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "When people do not have, you know, living a subjective life, don't really know themselves well, feel themselves well, understand what's happening, there can be pleasure in being angry."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "But if that person really feels what's going on deeply inside, doesn't only be outward directed, it's really damaging."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "But the important thing to understand that settling our reactivity is not meant to be a repression of ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "We want to hear the message."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "A long period of time, I think we want to figure out, what is it, how is it that we can cooperate with others? How can we create a cooperative world? How can we create a collaborative situation in this world where we learn how to talk with each other, learn how to be together, learn how to respect each other for all the feelings we have, learn how we respect other people's anger."}
{"prompt": "Becoming Wise About Anger and Frustration", "completion": "So sometimes I think that one of the most important things that this country could use is a lot of wisdom about anger."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So last week I talked about particular teachings of the Buddha that are called the Kalama Sutta teachings."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And then at the end of that talk, Ganesh, who is not here today, asked about, brought up a different teaching that is maybe a little bit similar."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "We have a statue of her in the outer hall there."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And somehow the Buddha and his lifestyle, his teachings, practices that he had that they somehow were important enough that she left everything behind in order to go and take up a contemplative life."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "It would be good if the blessed one with the Buddha would teach me the Dharma in brief so that, having heard the Dharma from the Buddha, from the blessed one, I might dwell alone, secluded, ardent and resolute."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And you'd have to register for retreats and end up in the waiting list."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And that's what transformed me."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And for whatever reason, when they heard about the Dharma, the practice, the teachings, that that really spoke to them and spoke to some depth of who they are."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to many desires, not to few desires."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to laziness, not to arousing effort."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "But, Gotami, those things that you know, this leads to the fading of lust, not to lust."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "This leads to arousing effort, not to laziness."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "The Buddha didn't seem to provide that certainty in terms of classic ideas of doctrine and ultimate truth."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And that movement from the agitated, contracted, attached state to a peaceful, expansive, and non-attached state is the, that's the movement, that's the transformation that the Buddha was emphasizing."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And if you read a Dharma book, hopefully it's a mirror for you to kind of look into yourself and maybe begin touching into, to seeing how this works for yourself."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "It's a very different context."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "I've been on solitary retreats in little cabins, little hutts."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "So what I'd like to suggest as we come to an end here is that I would like to name each of these eight qualities."}
{"prompt": "The Dharma in Brief", "completion": "And maybe there's been a time like that that you can remember or that you can feel."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I want to go talk about how to be kind."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "This is something that we passed through, at least."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "How do we work with it? We all have these lists in our minds, if only."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I'm on it, man, I'm all over it."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "So generally speaking, there's a way that in almost any moment, there's always something wrong."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It gave me a way to understand that what Nisir Gadatta said."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "And to see through these thoughts and reactions can be extremely difficult."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "This endless violence of how we should be."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "Imagine thinking that practice will lead you to have more hair."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "This is not something to get good at."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "So if we find ourselves in this deep groove in our patterned mind, it's like this hamster wheel of obsessive thought."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "He said, what can we gain by sailing to the moon if we're not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves? This is the most important of all voyages of discovery, and without it, all the rest are not only useless, but disastrous."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I imagine the Buddha driving a car, I drive a low rider."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "I imagine him driving the low rider and I'm in the back."}

{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "Do you value your reasons for staying small more than the light shining through the open door? Forgive yourself."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "It's a controversial instruction that I'm sure some of my teachers would take issue with."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "So how do we use them for what they're good for? Which is to see the pain of being at war with ourselves or how we talk to ourselves, the tone."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "We keep touching in to these touch points."}
{"prompt": "Working With Judgment", "completion": "And here I am loving poems."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "Exploring this relaxed, receptive quality, this very natural quality in our minds."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relax, Receive, Allow", "completion": "And one of the most supportive things that can happen there is to check in and see, has there been tension that's crept back in while the mind was wandering? And connecting to relaxing again, relaxing, relax, receive, allow."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to What is Already Here", "completion": "Often what happens is that as we scan and notice an area that's tight, often we weren't so conscious of it before, and simply becoming conscious of it, there can be a natural movement in the direction of relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Opening to What is Already Here", "completion": "Awareness will already be aware of something, so what is that? Having ourselves step out of the control of deciding and see what is naturally being known in this moment."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So when we say Vedana is translated as feeling, it's the sensation plus the emotion as well."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "The music has got to be louder."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So it's not just kamma tamha, but it's the grasping after kamma tamha."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I've got eyes, I've got ears, and unless you go in for those really aesthetic practices which try to cut off, and actually some of the yoga traditions do that, you find this very much this idea of pratiyahara in Sanskrit, and they actually have the idea of the tortoise withdrawing all its limbs and its head back into the carapace, into the shell here."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And actually you get that impression from a lot of monastic practices that that's exactly what you're doing, you're denying the world."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "These two are intimately linked because Bhavatana, the craving to be, can also be represented by the things I have."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Again, I think the Buddha is making a kind of jibe at the Brahmins with their idea of the atman and that which is indestructible, immutable."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Actually, we get the sense of being confined in a very narrow space by it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And this is the crux of really what we're starting to observe."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Some Vedanas, for example, some feelings are, I would say, hardwired."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It's actually proliferating more and more thought, more and more stuff we're trying to avoid."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It's a very useful convention."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So that movement from reactiveness of contraction to the responsiveness of openness and spaciousness."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Now there's one thing we haven't talked about, and perhaps I'll mention this start on this day, because it's related to this."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So what I think the Buddha is trying to get us to see is the way that we try to create identity out of any mode of being that we can inhabit."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "And what this not-self or not-fix-self is, is actually a spacious process, where I'm not tied to being any one thing."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "What the hell's going on here? Let's get it right down to basics because if you haven't got that question, what is going on here? However you want to put it, you haven't got the interest or the curiosity to start to examine it and you tease it apart, to start to see the patternings in your experience, to stay with the difficulties as well."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Is that why this is translated as 12 links of co-origination often? Co-origination, yeah, co-conditioned genesis is another translation for it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So this may be interpreted as a Buddhist model of our mental process."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It remains a nice intellectual theory."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I think it's a very good strategy."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "It's very useful to do that and actually that's part of what you're doing."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "They're always saying, I'm true."}

{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "This is what I'm saying about the interest in kerosene, it's a bit like pulling a piece of cotton, or a piece of thread, it starts to begin to unravel."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I think the best translation for this word is disenchantment, starting to become disenchanted with patterns that have seemed so seductive, and the ways of doing things which have seduced us."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "We progressively see that we're no longer seduced by the magical game that's being played by it."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Yeah? Again, we can go off into what I call heavy-handed religious stuff, and I really don't think, and I'm giving you a very personal message here, I really do not think from my reading of the text that's what the Buddha's doing at all."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "Sanskrit was the language of the intellectuals, and that starts by the end of the third century BCE, depending on when you put the Buddha's death, but I put it about 400 BCE, by the end of the third century BCE, texts are starting to be composed in sanskrit, Buddhist texts, which meant that ordinary people had no access to that stuff at all."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "But, often this is associated with images."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "So it's better to get yourself into a position that you, you're not going to experience intense pain, particularly if you're going to sit in those long periods of time, and you experience if you've sat for an hour or whatever, however long it might be and you've had really bad pains in your knees, don't sit cross-legged, sit on a chair."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I think it drops back into asceticism."}
{"prompt": "Buddhism Before the Theravada Part 6", "completion": "I wouldn't say without any discomfort because no matter where you sit, you're probably going to get some discomfort."}

{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Are you aware? What is obvious? Relax and receive, what is most obvious in this moment? And what is most obvious now? Exploring this, following the attention, staying connected can either be the sense of letting things come to you, or just staying connected and following the attention."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Do you want something to happen? Do you want something to stop happening? Is there confusion, disconnection? Or maybe it's okay."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "This is my first visit here, it's quite extraordinary."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "We'll start with a short meditation."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It's very simple but it has really been very helpful both for myself and a lot of people, yogis."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It's very simple, be mindful there is a body to the extent necessary for clear knowing and continuous mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And the fact that that phrase, there is a body, be mindful, there's a body is in quotes, as I'm told in the Pali, this is in Analiya's book, he makes this point."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And just in the process of framing it, the studs are in for the walls, but before the walls enclose the building, the frame is there."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And so what may arise is the feeling of the body breathing, or different sensations coming and going, thoughts or emotions or sounds, whatever."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "I found it helpful to repeat the phrase periodically as a way of coming back to the simplicity."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So this afternoon, the title of the talk is, What is mindfulness and what isn't it? What it's not."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It's especially given the great interest and spread of mindfulness teachings now in the country in all sorts of venues."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "As you know from your practice, very often thoughts come and we're not aware that they've arisen, and we get caught up in the content, and are carried along on this train of association."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And you know the difference."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "You know, thoughts come, go here, go there, do this, do that, get married, get divorced."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "But this observing power is also not enough."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So once I was on retreat, it was the first time I was sitting with Saada Upandita."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Very, as you might know and know of him, a very demanding teacher."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "There was a lot of pressure."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So I just looked up and I looked a little more carefully."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So one time I was sitting and I was just going through a lot of sadness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "If there's desire and aversion, then again, it's not mindfulness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "We're attached to wanting, and you know the sense of relief when we finally get to the last page, we put the catalog down."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "At one point when it was really intense, there was fear about going from sitting to standing."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And that was the first moment of acceptance in all that time that I had been with it."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "I was being with it, wanting it to go away, because it was very unpleasant."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "The acceptance allowed it to flow."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "It's just, yeah, there's a free flow and there's a block."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "He got on my case for calling it a block."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And when I could be just with the tightness and really be accepting of it, then it's possible to see all the nuances of change within the tightness."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Sometimes there's even kind of the wanting of the next breath."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "You know, it's like, just we're leaning forward a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "He said, our practice is not to follow the heart, but to train the heart, you know, and so much of kind of spiritual circles."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "You know, let's just follow your heart."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Well, one of the things I think we see, and this is one of the great challenging virtues of a Pasana practice, we begin to see that not everything in our heart is worth following."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "We see all their annoying habits and all the irritating things they do."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Well, that's just, you know, a particular pattern, and if we can see that, if we can be mindful of it, calling to mind what's skillful, what's unskillful, choosing the metta channel, and then focusing on actually what is good in the person."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So it inspires us to make wiser choices."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "So instead of reading and, oh yeah, that sounds right."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And seeing just the arising and passing of sensations, the sounds, the thoughts, whatever, we're really experiencing just things coming and going, we're experiencing the impermanence."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And so then we just hang out for a little bit in that experience of the mind that is not clinging."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And then we say, oh yeah, this is not agitated."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "And we can get a very intuitive sense that it's out of that non-agitation that opening to freedom, opening to nirvana is possible."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "This, I think, is my favorite."}
{"prompt": "Mindfulness - Part 1", "completion": "Mindfulness is the best thing I have done in my life, second grader."}

{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "One is to suppress them or deny them."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And we try to fill our lives with light or beauty or something other than what's actually here, some ideal situation."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Another way is maybe the opposite is to just let all our reactions out and just be loudly and incessantly complaining or insisting that everything be different and always changing it or blaming others or demanding that things be different or be very energetic or vocal in the way that we are responding to what's happening."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Or is there a way that I can use the teachings in a creative way? So the story of the poisonous tree is that, on first discovering a poison tree, some people see its danger."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Maybe who have access to a little bit more openness or spaciousness at that moment."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "So maybe it's not hatred, but maybe it's this ill will or lack of openness."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And then there's a third type of person who sees the same tree and maybe it's the same person at a different time and says, oh, a poison tree."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And this individual picks the fruit, investigates its properties, mixes it with some other ingredients and uses this poison as a great medicine to heal the sick and transform the ills of the world."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "Like, you know this view makes sense to me, but now I wonder if this is what's causing my suffering or maybe even it's clear once we notice."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "The third noble truth, of course, reminds us that it is possible to let go of these attachments."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "That is that knowing that there is having an appreciation, that there is a practice, doesn't mean it's easy, doesn't mean it's fast and quick, and doesn't mean it's what we were hoping for, but there's something about just knowing that there's a path of practice that can be uplifting."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "A little bit more tranquility in the body because tranquility might pervade the mind, it might create the conditions in which there is a real sense of well-being as contentment."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "There's going to be some disenchantment, some no longer being under the spell."}
{"prompt": "Difficulties", "completion": "And then after liberation there's a freedom, this letting go of attachment."}

{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "We are something, of course, but we don't have to have any stress and contraction, compaction around that self often has to do with our thinking."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "Sometimes it sort of has to do with that some people are emotionally based, and some people are more somatically based."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Thoughts and Emotions (3 of 5) Thinkings Emotions", "completion": "It's the messenger, and we stay with the messenger and we don't read the message."}

{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "And next is to notice and appreciate any beneficial conditions in the mind that are sporting that."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "So often that is noticing the intentions."}
{"prompt": "Cultivating and Extending Wholesome States, with Guided Meditation", "completion": "Other conditions to attend to to cultivate include mindful awareness itself and savoring rather than clenching down on it, savoring over clinging."}

{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And he learned so much and he shares that with humility in the book about how the people who became his teachers had lost so much, had lost so much mobility and, you know, with old age, what happens, and friends, relatives, with some of them not being able to live where they wanted to live, being transferred, losing their friends, etc."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And actually, there is research that suggests that when we get older, even though we lose so much, we lose so much, but the level of happiness actually increases, which is quite surprising."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Releasing, letting go of the thoughts of the past, what has come into now, until now, preoccupations, and thoughts of the future."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Again, we can bring back all the thoughts later."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Tune the radio of your mind to what's wholesome, it's nourishing, it's good."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Tuning the radio of the mind to goodness, perhaps of some actions in the past, maybe kindness or acts of generosity, let yourself sit in the ripples, nothing else to be done right now, this is enough to sitting in ripples of goodness, trusting, tuning the radio of the mind to goodness, you can do this."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "What is here, what is enough? Thank you all, thank you for your practice."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "I want to share a couple of reflections before I invite you to share yours."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "So yes, we can continue to plan, to be in the world, to serve, to make plans, all of that."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Bill says, pleased to see that slowing the breath did slow my mind."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "I don't want to ring the bell, but it times up."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "And when I allow myself to relax to the deepest, I still feel this background rumbling of jangling nerves."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "The two can coexist and the moment you see that, there's a person who wrote whose practice is not regular yet, the moment you see that jangling and jangling can be together coexistent with peace and contentment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "The peace can be spacious enough to hold it, then wow, then your practice would open to the next level."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Happiness Is A Choice You Make", "completion": "Okay, the rooms are closed, everyone is back, welcome back."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the inside of the throat can soften and relax."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "Maybe the heart can relax the stomach and the intestines."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And now there is some measure of physical and mental relaxation."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "What is actually here is usually some effect that the wandering has had on us."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation", "completion": "And we'll have an hour for this."}

{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "One of the questions that almost inevitably presents itself when we think about the Four Noble Truths is why did the Buddha present them in that sequence? Now traditionally, the answer to this question is contained within the titles that are given to each one."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In other words, first of all, you notice that you are suffering."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In other words, his teaching is primarily therapeutic and pragmatic."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Well, what is it that is primary and original in the Buddha's teaching, and what is it that is simply a reiteration of teachings and practices and aims and goals that's already part of his Indian culture? Are you following me, or is this getting too academic? All right, you're with me? So let's go back to the text."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And finally, the cessation of craving, the stopping of craving, is the condition that allows the creation and the cultivation of another way of life, the eightfold path."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And this, I feel, is not only more in keeping with the sequence of ideas in the text itself, how I mentioned before, that the Four Noble Truths, the first sermon, is an illustration of the principle of conditioned arising."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So in other words, we can trace this development from the Bodhi Tree experience to the first sermon in an entirely consistent and logical way."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Craving is the origin of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Now, a lot of people who come on retreats, who will begin to study Buddhism, frequently ask, well look, suffering, what does the Buddha say about that? Birth, aging, sickness, death, how is craving the origin of birth, sickness, aging, death? And the Buddha has said very clearly, this is suffering, birth, sickness, aging, death."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "This is the origin of suffering, craving."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And this is exactly how it's presented in the doctrine of the twelve links of dependent origination."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I'm not going to deal with the first one."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Nam and form, which means basically form means the external world, the physical world, and nama means the mental processes that are involved in being conscious of that physical world."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "It's taken so literally that I've had people come up to me and say, I've been practicing Buddhism for ten years now, and I'm still suffering."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Now, in my work on the reconstruction of the Buddha's life, it's quite clear that the Buddha suffered enormously."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But the point is, the Buddha is embedded in a world that he cares for."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Otherwise, you're a sociopath basically."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "What the Buddha is teaching is how do we live in this world in a way in which our human life flourishes to an optimum degree, and that entails embracing the suffering of the world."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "It is the traceless fading away and cessation of craving, the letting go and abandoning of it, freedom and independence from it."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Is that equivalent to the ending of suffering? Can't be, because you're still going to get sick, you're still going to get old, you're still going to die, things are going to happen to you that you don't want."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And that's very clear here."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But I do think it's a very, very crucial thing."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "There's a very interesting sutta in here, Marjha Manikaya, this is called the Satcha Vibhanga Sutta, the exposition of the truths, the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And he says, varnaris bhikkhus in the deer park at Isipatana, the tatargata set rolling the matchless wheel of the dharma, which cannot be stopped by any recluse, or Brahmin, or God, or Mara."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "He doesn't go any further."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "When you were talking about how can you see the suffering of others and."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I mean, to remember Robert Thurman talking about the fact that we're all enlightened right now and we're all Buddhas right now, even though we don't know it."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Well, let's forget about Robert Thurman."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And I can aspire to that through my practice of the path, which is hard work."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But I can't, in all good faith, acknowledge that every person I meet is a Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So it's meaningless to me."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "And also, as the Buddha says, as I understand what the Buddha said, in any case, it's irrelevant."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "You started out saying if you had a Zen, a Tibetan, and so where are you putting this in terms of the Buddha and the culture that he grew up in? Well, again, you see, this is a good question."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "This is the Marjha Menakaia."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Well, I mean, you know that I'm interested in what the real life of the Buddha was and what text you're getting out of, but also I'm just curious about how this all is contextualized, how we can see this as part of the culture that the Buddha grew up in."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I'm sure he accepted that the world was flat, that it was surrounded by an ocean, and in the ocean is the Mount Sumeru."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Again, we can find this in the Upanishads."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "He rejects many of the key religious ideas, the idea of Atman and Brahman, God and soul."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "He gives a radically new reading of many classical ideas."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In other words, he's coming out of that culture and presumably still accepts certain elements of it."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "He wanted to leave us his legacy, a community and a dharma, a doctrine or a law, really, the word dharma means law, that would enable people to live in this world in a radically different way."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But one of the things that was most striking in trying to reconstruct the Buddha's life is the passages in the canon that describe the events that happened immediately after his death, until the first council about nine months later."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So what happens, and it's remarkable how much evidence there is for this, is that there was a power struggle, a struggle which focused around two figures, Ananda and Mahakasyapa, Mahakasyapa."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Don't think that after I am gone, Ananda, you will have no teacher, the dharma will be your teacher."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "By the time of the first council, Mahakasyapa is in charge."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So I think that illustrates that there was already a tension between different visions or different versions of what the Buddha intended as his legacy."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "On hearing of the death of Sariputta, which died shortly before the Buddha."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "The new men suit me not at all."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "But what is curious is that when you read these suttas, the Buddha gives a discourse, and then it'll say, and after this discourse, 15 members of the audience became arahats, 50 became stream entrants."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Which are the first epigraphic evidence."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In other words, carved writing on rock that then presents, gives us another glimpse."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I mean, even the term like kanda, which was a kind of a in use in the time of his day, meaning just heap or bundle, he used that to mean a part of the mind-body process."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Suffering, old age, sickness, death, etc."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "It seems like we're confusing suffering and pain."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "I still can have a whole lot of pain."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Craving is basically its existential inhibition."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Māra, the devil, the demonic."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "In your book, Living with the Devil, you define a path as the absence of impediments."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "When Ananda returned to Rajgaha, he was summoned to see Kasipa."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Are these not grey hairs growing on my head, said Ananda? You have no right to call me boy."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "Or do you have a question, a quick one? I just have a comment."}
{"prompt": "Deconstructing Buddhism (part 3)", "completion": "So that whether or not you can know about rebirth, whether they're unknowable, so they're essentially irrelevant."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "And then we trace ourselves to that lineage teaching insight meditation."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "So this book, this text is central to it all."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "The text opens up with a very dramatic kind of promise or statement."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "So if you jump into this direct path before we've laid the preparation for it, it can be harder."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "And so there are these four foundations for doing this."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "The basis upon which awareness becomes clarified, becomes revealed, and becomes freed."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "I think back in September or so I went through each of these four."}
{"prompt": "Satipatthana (1) Introduction", "completion": "Repetition in a written text is boring and puts us to sleep sometimes or our attention wanders."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "When we look at them and with this question, is it actually reliable? We often will find the answer is no, it's not."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "It's more of an understanding."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "Those qualities of mind that create so much tension and stress and suffering in our experience."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And the peace that was the transformative peace was this power of waking up, the power of being aware, being aware of the experience in the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And I would take a step and I'd feel the sensation of my foot on the ground and be like, wow, I'm not doing that."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And early on, I think I definitely had the feeling of taking refuge in the doing of the practice, you know, that, that the, what the Buddha taught, the teachings of the Buddha, the practices that he taught, this is the Dharma."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "That the nature of experience is impermanent and unreliable, impermanent, unreliable and not self."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "But that's where the alignment comes in, because that is the nature of experience."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "You know, we may drop into that feeling of that alignment every now and then."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And it's interesting when that happens, because it feels so clear, so obvious."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "This is, this is the, the Sangha refers to the community of monastics, but it more deeply refers to those beings who have followed the teachings to realization, to some depth of realization."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "I see this on retreat a lot, the way this feels as a refuge, that the sense of struggling while I'm practicing, like, you know, like, I can't do this anymore and I'll open my eyes and I'll look around and I'll see people sitting quietly or see somebody moving their arm mindfully."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "This, this, this illness can be cured."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "We have to take the medicine."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "Every day, you got to do this."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "And that's challenge for us."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "But I will say one last thing."}
{"prompt": "Refuge in the New Year", "completion": "We don't have to seclude ourselves in our usual ways that we think about secluding ourselves to find this refuge."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "So I think because I see it, I'll just repeat myself for a way to, it comes back on again."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "But when you take a lot of those short little side paths that go off, the narrow side paths that go off from the big wide road, then you go off into the thickets of the jungles, the woods, and the wilderness where you may not come back so quickly or just put you in circles or as you're wandering around for a long time before you come back to the main road."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And one of the side paths is doubt, confusion, is wondering what to do, and what am I supposed to put, where am I going, and am I able to do this? Is this the right teaching? What about this teaching of not self? And it doesn't make any sense that the Buddhists teach it."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "But in meditation, that's where we can have this radical simplicity of just being with the obvious, being present for this, this."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "And there's doubts in daily life."}
{"prompt": "Dharmette: Satipatthana (47) Hindrances: Doubt", "completion": "I think it's kind of wonderful that we have an issue like this that we don't lose the connection more than a few moments."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "This exercise in the fourth foundation says that we should observe our experience looking at or understanding in the present moment these four areas or aspects of experience."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "One understands as it actually is, this is the origin or the arising of suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So as we explored last week, the language here, it's language of understanding."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "This experience here right now, this is suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I mean, mindfulness is simply this recognition of kind of the reflective of this is what's happening in the present moment as an experience in the present moment, but people often take that teaching to mean, and you don't do anything with it, and you don't respond."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So what I was exploring was anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And then I got a little bit of instruction around, well, notice, can you notice this experience as experience in the present moment? And I was a complete newbie to this whole thing, complete, like I didn't understand quite how it would make any difference."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I began to notice that this was suffering."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "That is kind of a little bit of that understanding or that insight."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And in my own experience, sometimes they're really simple."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And I think around this insight of this is suffering, it can be really simple."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So continuing the, the exploration around the anger in my, in my, in my first couple of months of practice."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And that, that came more clearly in a way because this is the story I tell a lot."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So I saw the, I saw that I was cutting the apple, I saw the memory, I saw the impulse to anger."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And I attribute that to the wisdom of the practice because it wasn't a choice I could have made."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "It's not what something let go."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "I understand, I, it's like, I saw that it's not something I do right in that moment."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "And so then you know, theoretically, that it's possible to get the whole thing clean."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "That orientation of experience is what right mindfulness, a kind of a simple way to describe what right mindfulness is."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "We don't have to, we don't have to give up or feel like, well, just because I, you know, have had all these gaps in my mindfulness, it's hopeless."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "That's this promise that if seven days of mindfulness, seven days of wise mindfulness, of right mindfulness will lead to freedom."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So sometimes an orientation to that, like the orientation to looking at it through the lens of is dukkha there, noticing when dukkha is not there."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "It can be harder to notice and be mindful in those times."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "But if you can kind of begin to attune to that, attune to, oh, it's kind of neutral."}
{"prompt": "Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness:  The Four Noble Truths as Insights", "completion": "So, but it's a great exploration."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "That's the Buddhist word, and the word Concentration, I think for many people who speak English, it can have associations that are maybe not so useful for the cultivation of Samadhi."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then, same thing, that was in Burma, in practice in Japan."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And they'd say, you know, they'd yell sometimes, Concentrate."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so, if you listen to the rhetoric of what people say about what the practice is, you sometimes have to kind of open up more widely to understand there's a larger context for the teachings they're giving."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "They don't think about it so much because the context is so strong."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Having a break didn't really work, as you could have."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So if it was anything less than 16 hours and 24 hours, you were in trouble."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So that's why I like the word samadhi."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Come on baby, light my fire or something from a longer time."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "That when I, when concentration kicks in for me, the samadhi kicks in, I really feel like it's a gift."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I sometimes like the English word composure as connected to samadhi, that to really compose and center and settle on ourselves in a holistic way."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "It can operate much more efficiently than a mind that's distracted and caught up."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And so there are these practical benefits from it like that."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "In Buddhist practice there's a number of, maybe three primary benefits that are talked about."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "You don't have to get anywhere or do anything or prove yourself to anyone or apologize for anything."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "But to realize, you don't have to have any of that stuff."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "We have a whole host of mental faculties in our minds, capacities that we have that can be developed and grow and become strong."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Sometimes because the heart of it is so subtle or so subliminal or so almost subconscious maybe, that unless the mind is very bright and strong and concentrated, and still can you see the subtle operating of the mind."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "It felt like I was standing on the edge of abyss, and someone told me to step over the edge."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And generally, it's the people who develop good concentration who have the easiest time with the whole path of letting go."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Occasionally you can fall accidentally into concentrated states, and you don't know why."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "If I'm supposed to get concentrated, that's what I'm going to do."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So what I'm trying to say here, there's a whole host of mental faculties that have come into play when we're engaged in attention practices."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So it's not quite the same as persistence."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And it's so strong to be inspired."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then it helps if you are not in a hurry and you enter into it as this is a self-learning exercise."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "If I just recognize what's going on, I'm going to stay concentrating on my breathing."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "I have to be a little bit more involved."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Just a pinball machine, just kind of like."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Just observe, just be open, open awareness, settle with it."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "What helps you stay present, stay involved, stay connected, stay focused, stay steady, stay interested."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "So, oftentimes, it's useful when you're going to meditate to do a little bit of preparation for the meditation, which means you don't just sit down and try to go zero to sixty."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And one of the ways to do that preparation is to have those feelings towards yourself, to have some degree of respect and reverence, care for yourself as a human being here."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Meditation is not about collecting experiences."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "Some of you might have seen these photographs of little babies who are sitting upright with just their diapers on, their upper chest, you see their back, and you see this wonderful, alert, alive, attentive spine."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And then as you exhale, relax, imagine you're relaxing your whole scalp."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And if you put all those parts of the body together, you kind of get the full body."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "This is where the lived life is."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "To allow the thinking mind to settle down, relax."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "The gentle waves lift you up and lower you down as the waves come."}
{"prompt": "Introduction to Concentration Class 1", "completion": "And finally, if you're not distracted by thoughts, if you're present for your breathing, if you're thinking, if you are thinking the thoughts are about the breathing itself, assume that you're doing it all right."}

{"prompt": "Equanimity (1 of 5): Introduction", "completion": "I'll come check out the comments here, and see you."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Evidence for Not-self", "completion": "So it's kind of an exploration, the practice isn't about how do I let go of it, but how do I understand what I actually think self is, we need to understand what we think self is, and that supports the mind to release it, and we don't do the letting go, it's like you know we don't we don't look at this and say oh there's that self I can let that go, it's more the understanding that we're misunderstanding, and the system kind of recalibrates and lets go of that misunderstanding, nothing really changes except the misunderstanding goes away, so it's kind of a funny thing, but but there are ways that we get caught, we identify with things, this person mentions a fear of failure, we identify like for me I had a very strong identification around anger and self-hatred, and there are many of those identities can be very painful, and so they're suffering bound up often with some of our identities, but not always, you know sometimes our identities are kind of, I think many of our identities in the ways that we attribute a sense of self are kind of strategies for navigating the world, there are ways of ways that we have responded to the world that have kind of become patterns, and those patterns become familiar, and then we kind of have a sense of yeah that's the way I respond to this situation, and I'd say too that those you know those identities, those strategies for navigating life, they're not even the ones that are like like my self-hatred, you know even those, there's something in there where that strategy is somehow trying to help us, you know it's like these strategies are created in our conditions and our conditioning in our lives, and often they are they are trying to help us in some way, and so part of the exploration around getting to know what we think of as self or exploring our identities, and that's one of the ways I like to think about this, how do we how do we begin to understand not-self, we begin to understand not-self by exploring our identities, getting familiar with our identities, and as we get familiar with our identities we see that some of the threads of our identities are kind of tied up with you know reactive patterns in history, and some of those threads are tied up with wishing for our well-being and our safety and the safety of our community and our family and our friends, and so those senses of self are not always wholly you know reactive, and so I think that the investigation or the exploration around what is it that we take to be self, what are what are what what is this identification, what is it that I'm thinking of as self, that kind of helps that investigation or that curiosity begins to help the mind to kind of understand which parts of those of those patterns are based in wholesome wishes for our well-being and our safety and our security and our and so those are meta-wishes actually, those are those those are meta-wishes and many of the strategies that we navigate life with are connected to those meta-wishes but they do get kind of tangled up with fear and confusion and wanting and a version but so they get tangled up, but the the process of exploring the identity with mindfulness and that's a lot about what we can do here get familiar with what we're calling a sense of self with mindfulness, that the mindfulness begins to help the mind tease apart the reactive side from the the side that's actually rooted in wholesomeness and so the the investigation of the exploration begins to help us to to understand that we were calling something a thing that isn't a thing and then begins to tease apart the processes that were embedded in that and help us to let go of the processes that are not so helpful and encourage the processes that are helpful so this this this exploration around letting go of identity I think I think I would put it more can we understand our identities and then the wisdom that develops as we understand our identities helps the system to let go of those parts of the process that are not so helpful and and supports those parts of the process that are more leading in the direction of an ease a heart of ease a heart of connectedness a heart of caring a heart of compassion so I wanted to kind of start there with the kind of that frame that what we explore here one of the big explorations is kind of curiosity about what is what do I call self and we all have many different things that we call self actually when we start to ask this question of ourselves what do I take to be self we might find and we talked about this a little bit last week we I asked you to kind of name some things and and some people talked about identity you know roles you know different roles that you take so you know parent or sibling or student or co-worker or those kinds of things those can be identities and we also identify with particular patterns in our mind habits of mind like for me the identification with the habit of self-hatred it's like oh yeah that's me I hate myself you know so that the we identify with patterns and familiar familiar things that arise so there's a lot of different ways that we identify and over the course of this the the series of reflecting on having conversations about not self we'll touch on a variety of those different different ways social identities that we might reify around or take to be me or mine emotional identities and role identities we'll talk about some of those but tonight what I wanted to aim at was one that the Buddha really highlighted in his teachings there's a one Sutta where he kind of gives a discourse on this teaching of not self and I won't go through the whole discourse tonight because I liked it what I'm trying to do in this class is talk for a short while and then open it up for conversation but we'll go over it during some of the other some of the other classes but a little piece of that is that he points out or asks he asks people to reflect he asks his followers having a dialogue with them and he asks them to reflect so I mean basically it comes down to can you control your body entirely you know it's like we we we can do certain things like I can choose to move my arm or you know you know do certain things physically so there's a little bit of control that I have around my body a little bit of control perhaps I can have around okay I'm gonna breathe in now gonna breathe out now so we have we have little ways in which we have control but we misattribute a a sense of control one of the key ways that the Buddha points to a sense of self coming a sense of self kind of a way that we identify as I or me is the part of our psyche or our system that seems to have control or that feels like it should have control so it we have this attribution of control a lot and we and when we and when we feel like we don't have control over something we usually feel I mean we might feel either that we blame somebody else for that we we feel betrayed by the world or you know somebody else took my control away from me or we blame ourselves we didn't do it right but what the Buddha points to he actually says for various areas of our experience he says you know the body is not self we tend to identify around the body he says the body is not self he said if the body were self then it would be possible to say of the body may my body be thus may my body not be thus but it is not possible to say that of the body because the body is not so and so it's kind of pointing to any he talks about that with respect to feelings and the ways that we perceive things and mind states that arise so emotions for instance he calls them mental formations the Pali is Sankara he says they're not self Sankaras are not self and so that includes the whole range of emotions and mind states and so we could substitute in there a couple of different emotional things like you know we sometimes feel like we should have control over our emotions like why why don't I have control you know why can't I just make the mind not be angry you know it's like it doesn't feel good to be anger why can't I turn it off but the Buddha would say well anger is not self it is if it were self it would be possible to say may my mind not be angry or you know may my mind be may my may my mind around anger be like this but it's often not possible to do that because the anger is a conditioned phenomenon it's arising based on conditions and sometimes those conditions have momentum and so we get to live out that we get to experience that so that I mean sometimes we can step back I mean there is little bits of elements of ways that our system is designed to navigate and choose okay well maybe I won't follow through on that anger or maybe I can repress that anger there so there's there's certain ways that our mind does have some measure of control and that some measure of control that we have it's like it's pretty small actually but our minds pick that up and think yeah I have control I should be able to control these things if I can't control them it means I'm failing or somebody is failing me or the world is to blame or there's something like that and so the one of the things that Buddha is pointing to in this I think one of the things I I find so so interesting is that so many so many ways that we get frustrated so many ways that we get frustrated are are simply manifestations of the fact that we don't have control over something so many ways that we get angry or confused is there's a piece of it around uncontrollability like that that I can't make it be the way I want it to be and the Buddha says that's just evidence for not self it's not a problem it is the nature of experience to have its own unfolding and so the the the kind of the curiosity we can explore around this particular sense of self I think is is to kind of be open to all of those times when there's a sense of I mean I think that this this this sense of self does manifest kind of more obviously perhaps with something like frustration like why can't I make this be the way I want it to be why can't I control this and so when there is that frustration and the mind is kind of railing about well why can't why can't I do this you know why can't why can't I be mindful when I want to be you know that very that that example you know I pointed to it in the in the guided meditation you know the mind will wander we sit down to meditate and say I'm going to be mindful and the mind wanders you know who did that that you didn't choose to have your mind wander it was a process that unfolded but when we wake up we blame ourselves you know we think I should have had control over that but and then the waking up is another whole piece you know it's like who did that you know the waking up happened the the mindfulness return of its own accord that too is evidence for not self so this this piece around the uncontrollability kind of that this is the key piece I wanted to kind of express and then we'll open it up to questions is there's a lot of evidence for this understanding of not self we just don't see it as evidence for not self we see it as a failure of self you know so the fact that the mind wanders is not a failure of the the meditation you know it's not a failure of the meditation its conditions unfolding and if we can explore that I mean if every time we reflected on the re-arising of the mindfulness as being oh evidence for not self that would begin to have a momentum of understanding around not self but no what we do is my mind wandered I I I shouldn't have done that what can I bring my mind back so so yeah there's a lot of evidence for not self actually and this is this is interesting because it's a count it feels counterintuitive right this this teaching of not self it feels like this self is so like obvious you know how can it not be what I think it is and so the but but what that that points to too is that we are not in we're we are misinterpreting the evidence for not self too we don't see it and and this is part of the way views work so we have a particular view for instance a view about something an idea about something and when we have an idea or a view the modern-day psychology calls this selective attention that when we have a particular perspective on a situation our mind based on that perspective will pull things out of the environment that confirm that view and won't pull things out of the environment that disconfirm that view and so the sense of self is like that view it's a view in our minds that we believe this me is here this I has control and so we don't when when we when evidence for not self when this this evidence around uncontrollability presents itself we don't understand it as a as evidence for not self we actually interpreted as evidence that I failed in somehow reinforcing the sense of self so this is a this is an interesting kind of exploration whenever there's a sense of feeling like it's uncontrollable you know maybe something happens like you know your your your washing dishes and the you know the dish lips and the dish breaks and it's like uncontrollability it's like why didn't I control it well it was conditions unfolding it wasn't I that didn't it wasn't an eye there it was just conditions unfolding and so anytime there's something that happens where there's that sense of uncontrollability maybe the mind can turn towards oh evidence for not self and just beginning to explore that as a different view you don't have to pick it up as true yet you don't have to believe it yet you don't have to like believe that this is true but just begin to question your your your perspective of self by kind of countering it with oh well maybe that's evidence for not self that I didn't have control of that so that's that's the main piece I wanted to reflect reflect on tonight and let's just check in and see actually let me break the recording here."}

{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "It also implies a whole realm, of entering into a whole realm, maybe dimension of the heart or the mind, which Buddhists would like to sometimes call sacred, or spiritual, or has to do with human perfection, or purity, or beauty, well-being, dimension of the psyche that is quite wonderful and phenomenal."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Remember when I first started meditating, I remembered, it was kind of like the meditations, the calm, the subtleness of meditation, kind of brought back memories I'd long forgotten, and it happens to many people."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "That sense of well-being can be a reference for what is possible."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Like the time I felt this tremendous clarity and openness and warmth for having an experience that put me, if I'd gone a foot further, sliding down the hill, I would have gone over that cliff."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So when I realized that, you know, I don't want to repeat that experience as a way of feeling some kind of special aliveness that's really present in here I am."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Some people have car accidents, or near car accidents, and just kind of wakes them up really quickly, really clear."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So, it's, you know, very simple, immediate."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "I have a teeny bit of a cold."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "I must be a bad person, or it's really important that I feel better."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Buddha gave this analogy, I don't know if this works exactly, but it comes to mind."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So in a normal life, if you're really anxious about any kind of normal thing, you're really anxious about, I don't know, choose something."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So what I'm trying to say here is that the normal everyday consciousness people walk around in has levels of discomfort, this ease, or suffering, or contractions, or tightness, or that often isn't invisible."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And then in that memory or in that understanding of it, then begin to search for the path."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "It would be great, right? But it doesn't really work that way."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And a lot of people in the 60s came through Buddhism through LSD."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "The drugs showed them a possibility and now they had to get down to work."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "You know, that's like pretty hot."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So, you know, but I think it's like it has this elegance."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Finding the path, the elegant solution to finding the path the Buddha offered was to look at our life through the framework of the Four Noble Truths."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Where is it in here that I contribute or that I am suffering and I contribute to that suffering? So the Buddha said that the duty or the responsibility in relationship to the first noble truth of suffering is to understand it."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "To understand it really well."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "That's the kind of, you know, the bad news of Buddhism."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "That's where it all begins."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "The thing is, in order to approach that freedom in a healthy way, you need to look at your suffering and understand it."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So underneath the umbrella of this word thirst or drivenness is things like clinging, craving, grasping, resisting, denying."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Like sometimes you feel a contraction in your brain and your mind."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "So the second noble truth is the truth of what gives rise to this discomfort, this dukkha, so this drivenness."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And you can put this pin into the weight that you want."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And so if I put the pin in the five pound weight, it doesn't really do much for me."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But if I could go down there and put it on that 20 or 50 or something, you know, then it's hopeless also."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And as you develop this capacity, the skill to look at suffering, to find its cause and to let go of it."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "But if they've been building that muscle for the few years before that crisis, they might have had the skills and the ability to understand what's going on that they don't have because they weren't practicing all along."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "I think a lot of people short-change themselves because they feel like other things are more important."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "As you look at that suffering, then explore."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Get to know it in a wise way."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "And I'm not going to go into them today, but those eight steps are a recognition that it's not easy to do this work."}
{"prompt": "Cessation of Suffering", "completion": "Seeing that the path is just a simple formulation."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "So for the theme for tonight, which is going to include our birth being inspired, it being Casey's birthday tonight."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Whereas the invitation tonight, even just talking about that, that tight vision kind of gets my heart clenched."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "So this sense of tenderness, letting there be a sense of tenderness for this being, who is you, who has this arc of life and is doing their best, doing their best and opening up, opening up to the mystery, opening up to this mystery."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "So having from this perspective, having tenderness, having the love, not self-flagellation, like, bad, bad me, do this, why can't you do this? Like, oh, sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, this is just being human, is just being human, is so, hmm, is so challenging enough, is so amazing enough, both challenging, beautiful, profound."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Letting, letting the breath be breathed on its own, the lower abdomen, and with each breath, landing, landing more deeply, arriving more fully into the present moment."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Gently smiling at the thoughts."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Just being breathed, just being breathed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Breath in the abdomen, calming soothing."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Being in the body can help expand our vision, not being in our heads."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Feeling the breath, feeling the feet on the floor, our hands, our bottom on the cushion."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "This miracle that was my body."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Who is you and not you? Parting, parting."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Loving unconditionally, offering love, good will."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Maybe warmth, good will, love."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "This being who is you and also not you, an expression of beauty, goodness, divine, Buddha nature, whatever words we like to give it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "So many dimensions are humanity and divinity, loving and being loved."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Thank you for that reflection."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "I am so glad you've discovered that and also sharing it with others Wayne because that opening the eyes was just a slight slit to let light in."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: The Arc of Our Life", "completion": "Isn't it nice? Nancy says we discussed the arc of our lives."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I think the main association I had with this word was through like geology of like aggregate rock, you know, that what is an aggregate rock though, you know, basically it's a rock made of other rocks."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So, you know, we can we can set aside the word aggregate and like thinking of this is really technical."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "The perception, the recognition of experience, mental formations, that that's a big area of emotions and mind states, thoughts, beliefs."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "This, there's the experience and there's the knowing of it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And then he says, what does it feel? It feels pleasant, it feels unpleasant, it feels neutral."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So it's got both sides of it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "There's no other part of experience that's happening."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So the, the, these processes are, the Buddha talks about them as being separate processes, but they are really interwoven, like they influence each other, they kind of weave together to form our experience, to create the human experience."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And so he pointed to beginning to recognize to understand these processes, to see them in our experience as a way both, so there's two pieces, he points to it as, you know, to help understand the sense of self and to see where clinging happens."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "What we are perceiving, I think there are things out there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I think, I think there's things are there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I mean, for myself, before I met the practice, I really strongly identified as being a miserable person."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "I'm just miserable, like, you know, not very happy."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "When we cling, we are selfing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "As we begin to be curious about these parts, these aggregates, and see them as processes at work, and then see them as influenced by the other processes that there's just these interweaving processes, it begins to undermine our, our, our sense or our belief that there is an I and me or a mind here."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "And then as you, as you see that, you start seeing how, for instance, the feeling tone, we, you know, when we experience something pleasant, we might start to recognize there's a difference between a pleasant feeling, and then the liking of it, and the need to have more of it, or there's a difference between, there's something unpleasant, and the desire to get away from it, or the desire, you know, the feeling of a version towards it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "It's kind of like a, and I would say that that force is karma."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "So is there a sutra that I can reference that would speak of this? There's many that would speak of which? What we're talking about the container and the cohesiveness and the mind and body."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: The Five Aggregates", "completion": "This takes me quite a while to even get to this point."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It's just pointing us to the reality, to the way things are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And so is everything in this phenomenal world."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And that was a good wake-up call, that was a good reminder."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So that opened a very good discussion on the reality that it will happen and how much healthier and easier it would be for her if she could begin to face it now."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And so it's freeing to be able to look at something directly and not have to push it away."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It is living with the recognition that we will all die at some point."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Including our ideas, our thoughts, our looks, our features, science, religion, everything, right? Everything that we hold dear is constantly changing."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And of course, we had all changed."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I don't know if any of you know of Eric Colvig, the Pasana teacher, a gay man."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Many years ago, many, because we were still in Palo Alto, he came to speak."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And it's a very poignant description of impermanence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "We all have some depression and some happiness, hopefully more of the happiness."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And depending on the situation, depending on the time, depending on what's going on in our lives, the amount, the ratio may vary."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And that was a great revelation that I was limiting myself because of this view."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I don't remember ever deciding I was shy."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "One is traveling and photographing throughout the West and mountains."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "They're smaller and smaller until they just become sand and, of course, eventually wash away into the rivers."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "That, you know, a rose in full bloom is very, very beautiful."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I just witness it and I sometimes find myself wishing they would settle down or when will they settle down? Right away recognizing this is the way things are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "Yes, and I think compassion for ourselves when we recognize that, you know? It's, I don't know, it's hardwired perhaps."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So it's exactly along those same lines."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So the hardest thing, and coming here I was thinking about it, the hardest thing for me is when they're having one of those really horrible mood swings when they're acting so badly is for me not to look at them and think, how am I going to do this until they're like 18 years old and what about boarding schools and I don't know if I can do this and it's just like it seems so permanent."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And then this morning I have cuddly little boys climbing on my lap and helping with breakfast and I forget."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And I get caught up in it and then I end up giving consequences that the next morning I regret how am I going to follow through with his consequence."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "It's just separating that is hard for me and it's my constant work."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So there it is, the recognition that change can lead to suffering."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And I find my bellwether of change is how bad my anxiety and my allergies are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And of course I am grasping and holding on tightly to that at the same time I'm saying, please take this from me, I'm letting go."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I get up in the morning and take my dog out and it's still dark usually."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And the moon is often out and it's fuller right now."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "But some mornings when I go out, I need a flashlight because it's so dark to find my dog who's black in the newspaper."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And then I notice just the light as it changes throughout my house during the day and then at the end of the day when my kids come home and yesterday we were outside all playing on the lawn and the way the light plays on the plants and then sinks below the hills and then the energy and the feeling that comes from that change is fascinating to me because I sense when this is happening and I don't know exactly how to describe it, but as the sun goes down and light gets darker and we come in and it's time for food and book reading and homework and snuggles and all those things that happen more in the darkness and less in the energy of the bright day."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "So either way, that will be a change."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And some of those things that I don't like will change, and of course, but I just thought, that's the way the universe treats us."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "You can't control, as you said, how your children are."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "That's one of the ways that I sort of check myself on how's my spiritual journey going."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "And I had one woman that really I pray with her three times a week and she's driving me crazy."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I'm just absolutely convinced it's through the practice."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I recently visited a Buddhist teacher who has had much pain from arthritis, and she really reminded me how difficult, how challenging it can be to live with chronic pain."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "That comes from the comparison, which is based on time as well, right? Yes."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "I just wanted to say one more short thing, and we can say more next week."}
{"prompt": "The Three Characteristics: Impermanence", "completion": "There's sadness, of course, but not the regret, because we valued it, we nurtured it, we honored it every step of the way."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So this includes mindfulness, this includes concentration, this includes equanimity and love and compassion, along with anger and frustration and irritation."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So our experience, any part of our experience, anything that we experience can be understood to be put together by these processes and also could be described as being the experience is the kind of the result of these processes."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So when we recognize things objects in the room, for instance, when we recognize a wall or a book or a couch or a cushion."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "This again, we, you know, when anger arises, we tend to act from that as a motivator."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "They motivate us to do something."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "And then he says that consciousness, we could say is the way I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Or I'm identifying with being the one in the one who knows, or I'm identifying with being the angry one or whatever it is."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "He described a the phrase is identity view."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "He talked about different ways that this identity view comes up with respect to these aggregates."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "This is in Majama 109, if you are interested in references, Majama 109 and this is paragraphs 10 and 11."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "There is the case where a run of the mill person who is untrained basically assumes form to be the self."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Does it feel like you're inside of that thing."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "I think I'll stop there and see if there's any comments or questions or reflections, and pick up the last piece of what I was going to say next time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So when you were talking the sense of, I was noticing that I have a self critic, which is like the mental formation that arises in me, but in most of the time it's unconscious and it's just so huge that I cannot see it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Yeah, I can see it, but mostly it's like operating on the under the radar and it's like huge and it's like 90% of the time and I mean lucky if it's 10% I can see it."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "You know, you've seen a little crack you know a little bit of what that experience of that judgment is, you know that experience of that you know, you know, you've seen a little bit of a larger that's kind of in there."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "And I just saw what that person was doing I was, I was judging them, and I didn't notice it in retrospect as we can notice that so this is a reflective practice."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "Then it might help us to notice when that kind of pattern might come up in the future, closer to the experience you know more in in real time."}
{"prompt": "Conversations on Not-self: Identity View", "completion": "So those are a few things you can you can explore with those really deep, you know those deep patterns there's we have a lot of them."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so what is most obvious in that mindfulness arising? What is being received? I used that terminology in the guided meditation also."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "All the seclusion and separation from my usual activities has shaken up my sense of self."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "It likes things to be similar and familiar, and so we orient in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And is there discomfort about that? So that's one side of the equation or the picture is looking at what is the sense of self or lack thereof and what is the relationship to that? Is there a kind of a sense of looking for who I am and who I am? A kind of a searching of how do I land with this experience? Who am I in this experience? If that's happening, that's useful to be aware of, to not have to figure out who you are, but to know, wow, searching for who I am is what's happening right now."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "And so there's a little bit of a buffer or something that the information is going through to feel perhaps a little more remote from the world."}
{"prompt": "Noticing Mindfulness in Daily Life", "completion": "Yeah, and I think that's really useful to notice that."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "sometimes it can help us to go beyond what we might be capable of doing when we're by ourselves."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And yeah, in thinking about how Mel's teachings have influenced me and how I practice meditation and vipassana meditation, this word came up, which was a word that another friend has used to describe Mel."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "We could, we could receive that teaching and think, well, as long as I have preferences, this way is going to be very difficult."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And the way to practice is to get to a place where I don't have any preferences."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "But then I think that maybe there's a little bit of a, I don't know if it's a deeper meaning or another meaning of this to be, to be one who is without preferences."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And maybe this gets illuminated if we change the word preferences to thinking."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "That there's this kind of full acceptance of who we are, of our humanity."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And we can just accept what's happening and find how, how can I relate to this? How can I be with this? So it's like this dance."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "Every moment is this dance."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "So this is Ordinary Mel is the Way."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "The way he is with illness."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "Maybe she was ninety-nine, or something, ninety-eight, ninety-nine."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "So Mel was, I guess, kind of short, I don't know, for American men."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "But he once told me that he really enjoyed very tall students."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "That they're not a barrier anymore."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "I don't know if there might be a few questions, but you're welcome to type in something in the chat, and it will make its way to me."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And if something wonderful happens, it's like, well, well, I'm so great."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And so I'm sure, I'm sure Mel interacted with him and I know he had great respect for Thich Nhat Hanh."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "I need to scratch my nose, my foot is falling asleep."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "If we just think, I'm gonna sit and move when I feel like it, well, we're not gonna really know that."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And when I think about mindfulness and awareness, one of the greatest gifts is that it simply, that it gives us more choice."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "How can I not talk so much? Yeah, yeah, you and me both, Wayne."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "You know, it's very easy if you're in a conversation, we just pull the attention just pours out into the other person or into what we're gonna say or they're speaking and we're thinking about what we want to say."}
{"prompt": "Imperturbability", "completion": "And then I can actually take in what's being said and my response is not just automatic, I'm thinking, it's actually coming from a little bit of a kind of coming from the belly rather than just coming from the head or coming from the heart, ideally, not just the head."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "So, so maybe there's not much more I want to say, but to say that, yeah, we'll start with a lot of silence tonight and just settling with the breath with the body and then in order to build stability in order to build spaciousness and then I'll have invitations for us to both include ourselves in our metta and our compassion, because even when difficult challenges are happening in the world and in war zones, our own personal suffering and dukkha does not end, does not cease."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Without further ado, let's practice together."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Let's arrive in our meditation posture."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Being embodied with the breath."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "If you are still using the counting device with the breath, let it be gentle."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "With each breath gently being fluffed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Just as if mane of a horse, soft, gently brushed."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "As if symbolically, as if you had a big brush."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "The same spirit of generosity and care."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "I appreciated this because it feels so overwhelming sometimes the offering that we hear about and feeling like there's nothing I can do about it."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "I don't see any hands or anything type in chat so maybe we'll close."}
{"prompt": "Happy Hour: Calming the Energy Body", "completion": "Thank you so much for your practice for your dedication."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "Andrea started that topic."}
{"prompt": "Guided Meditation: Relaxing Through Concentration", "completion": "You can circle between those contact points, for example, and if you already have another object that works for you, and then you can use that to us, of course."}
