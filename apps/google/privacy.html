    <li>Your current IP </li>
    <li>The URL of a talk, that you have just played or shared</li>
</ol>
None of this data is tied to your identity. These two pieces of data are strictly anonymous, and are used to generate community statistics. This anonymous data is retained permanently, and  stored in a password-protected firewalled database. This database is closed to all outside access.
